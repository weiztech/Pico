Google Scholar uses a web crawler, or web robot, to identify files for inclusion in the search results. For content to be indexed in Google Scholar, it must meet certain specified criteria. An earlier statistical estimate published in PLOS One using a Mark and recapture method estimated approximately 80–90% coverage of all articles published in English with an estimate of 100 million.
