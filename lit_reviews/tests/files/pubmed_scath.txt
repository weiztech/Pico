TI  - Esophageal Protection and Temperature Monitoring Using the Circa S-Cath™ 
      Temperature Probe during Epicardial Radiofrequency Ablation of the Pulmonary 
      Veins and Posterior Left Atrium.

AB  - Although epicardial bipolar radiofrequency ablation should diminish the risk of 
      esophageal thermal injury in comparison to an endocardial ablation, cases of 
      lethal atrio-esophageal fistula have been reported. To better understand this 
      risk and to reduce the possibility of a thermal injury, we monitored the 
      esophageal temperature with the Circa S-Cath™ temperature probe during and 
      immediately after the ablation while implementing three procedural safety 
      measures. Twenty patients (15 males; 63 ± 10 years) were prospectively enrolled 
      (November 2019-February 2021). All patients underwent an epicardial ablation 
      procedure, including an antral left and right pulmonary vein isolation with 
      bidirectional bipolar clamping, and a roof and inferior line using unidirectional 
      bipolar radiofrequency. Three procedural preventive mitigations were implemented: 
      (1) transesophageal echocardiographic visualization of the atrio-esophageal 
      interface, with probe retraction before the energy delivery; (2) lifting the 
      ablated tissue away from the esophagus during an energy application; and (3) a 30 
      s cool-off and irrigation period after the energy delivery. The esophageal 
      temperature was recorded using an insulated multisensory intraluminal esophageal 
      temperature probe (Circa S-Cath™). Of the 20 patients enrolled, 7 patients had 
      paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AF), 8 persistent AF and 5 longstanding 
      persistent AF. The average maximum luminal esophageal temperature observed was 
      36.2 ± 0.7 °C (34.8-38.2 °C). In our clinical experience, no abrupt increase in 
      the luminal esophageal temperature above the baseline was observed. Since no 
      measurements exceeded the threshold of 39 °C, no prompt interruption of energy 
      delivery was required. Intraluminal esophageal temperature monitoring is feasible 
      and can be helpful in confirming correct catheter position and safe energy 
      application in bipolar epicardial left atrial ablation. Intra-procedural 
      preventive mitigations should be implemented to reduce the risk of esophageal 
      temperature rises.

AB  - The recognition of toxic Al(3+) in foods and biosystems has of great interest to 
      researchers. Herein, a novel cyanobiphenyl-based chemosensor CATH 
      (E)-N'-((4'-cyano-4-hydroxy-[1,1'-biphenyl]-3-yl)methylene)thiophene-2-carbohydrazide 
      was fabricated and shown to recognize Al(3+) in HEPES buffer:EtOH (90:10, v:v, 
      pH = 7.4) by ''lighting-up'' fluorescence sensing. The CATH evidenced high 
      sensitivity (LOD = 13.1 nM) and excellent selectivity to Al(3+) over competing 
      cations. The Job's plot, TOF-MS and theoretical computation studies were 
      performed to probe the binding mechanism of Al(3+) to CATH. Additionally; CATH 
      was successfully utilized to practical applications and employed to recover of 
      Al(3+) from different food samples. More importantly, it was employed to 
      intracellular Al(3+) detection in living cells including THLE2 and HepG2.
