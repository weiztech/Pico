TI  - Complications From Operator Modification of the Esophageal Temperature Probe.
LID - e30388
AB  - Intraoperative temperature monitoring of surgical patients is an important aspect
      of perioperative care. Central core temperature monitoring is often accomplished 
      using an 18 French esophageal device inserted through the mouth into the
      esophagus, while patients are undergoing general anesthesia. Placement of a
      modified esophageal temperature probe (i.e. with the protective plastic covering 
      removed) into the nasopharynx of a patient may cause significant patient harm by 
      injuring the nasal mucosa and/or turbinates. An internal survey of current
      practice at our academic institution reveals that 78% of anesthesia providers
      modify the esophageal temperature probes, leading to an 11% injury incidence. A
      practical solution to avoid complications is to place a pediatric size 9 French
      esophageal temperature probe into the nasopharynx to monitor the central core
      temperature.

TI  - Non-Invasive Monitoring of Core Body Temperature for Targeted Temperature
      Management in Post-Cardiac Arrest Care.
LID - 810825
AB  - Importance: Accurate monitoring of core body temperature is integral to targeted 
      temperature management (TTM) following cardiac arrest. However, there are no
      reliable non-invasive methods for monitoring temperature during TTM. Objectives: 
      We compared the accuracy and precision of a novel non-invasive Zero-Heat-Flux
      Thermometer (SpotOn™) to a standard invasive esophageal probe in a cohort of
      patients undergoing TTM post-cardiac arrest. Design, Setting, and Participants:
      We prospectively enrolled 20 patients undergoing post-cardiac arrest care in the 
      intensive care units at the London Health Sciences Centre in London, Canada. A
      SpotOn™ probe was applied on each patient's forehead, while an esophageal
      temperature probe was inserted, and both temperature readings were recorded at
      1-min intervals for the duration of TTM. Main outcomes and Measures: We compared 
      the SpotOn™ and esophageal monitors using the Bland–Altman analysis and the
      Pearson correlation, with accuracy set as a primary outcome. Secondary outcomes
      included precision and correlation. Bias exceeding 0.1°C and limits of agreement 
      exceeding 0.5°C were considered clinically important. Results: Sixteen (80%) of
      patients had complete data used in the final analysis. The median (interquartile 
      range) duration of recording was 38 (12–56) h. Compared to the esophageal probe, 
      SpotOn™ had a bias of 0.06 ± 0.45°C and 95% limits of agreement of −0.83 to
      0.95°C. The Pearson correlation coefficient was 0.97 (95% confidence interval
      0.9663–0.9678), with a two-tailed p < 0.0001. Conclusion and Relevance: The
      SpotOn™ is an accurate method that may enable non-invasive monitoring of core
      body temperature during TTM, although its precision is slightly worse than the
      predefined 0.5°C when compared to invasive esophageal probe.

TI  - Critically buried avalanche victims can develop severe hypothermia in less than
      60 min.
LID - 29
AB  - Background: A major challenge in the management of avalanche victims in cardiac
      arrest is differentiating hypothermic from non-hypothermic cardiac arrest, as
      management and prognosis differ. Duration of burial with a cutoff of 60 min is
      currently recommended by the resuscitation guidelines as a parameter to aid in
      this differentiation However, the fastest cooling rate under the snow reported so
      far is 9.4 °C per hour, suggesting that it would take 45 min to cool below 30 °C,
      which is the temperature threshold below which a hypothermic cardiac arrest can
      occur. Case presentation: We describe a case with a cooling rate of 14 °C per
      hour, assessed on site with an oesophageal temperature probe. This is by far the 
      most rapid cooling rate after critical avalanche burial reported in the
      literature and further challenges the recommended 60 min threshold for triage
      decisions. The patient was transported under continuous mechanical CPR to an ECLS
      facility and rewarmed with VA-ECMO, although his HOPE score was 3% only. After
      three days he developed brain death and became an organ donor. Conclusions: With 
      this case we would like to underline three important aspects: first, whenever
      possible, core body temperature should be used instead of burial duration to make
      triage decisions. Second, the HOPE score, which is not well validated for
      avalanche victims, had a good discriminatory ability in our case. Third, although
      extracorporeal rewarming was futile for the patient, he donated his organs. Thus,
      even if the probability of survival of a hypothermic avalanche patient is low
      based on the HOPE score, ECLS should not be withheld by default and the
      possibility of organ donation should be considered.

TI  - Esophageal Protection and Temperature Monitoring Using the Circa S-Cath™
      Temperature Probe during Epicardial Radiofrequency Ablation of the Pulmonary
      Veins and Posterior Left Atrium.
LID - 6939
AB  - Although epicardial bipolar radiofrequency ablation should diminish the risk of
      esophageal thermal injury in comparison to an endocardial ablation, cases of
      lethal atrio-esophageal fistula have been reported. To better understand this
      risk and to reduce the possibility of a thermal injury, we monitored the
      esophageal temperature with the Circa S-Cath™ temperature probe during and
      immediately after the ablation while implementing three procedural safety
      measures. Twenty patients (15 males; 63 ± 10 years) were prospectively enrolled
      (November 2019–February 2021). All patients underwent an epicardial ablation
      procedure, including an antral left and right pulmonary vein isolation with
      bidirectional bipolar clamping, and a roof and inferior line using unidirectional
      bipolar radiofrequency. Three procedural preventive mitigations were implemented:
      (1) transesophageal echocardiographic visualization of the atrio-esophageal
      interface, with probe retraction before the energy delivery; (2) lifting the
      ablated tissue away from the esophagus during an energy application; and (3) a 30
      s cool-off and irrigation period after the energy delivery. The esophageal
      temperature was recorded using an insulated multisensory intraluminal esophageal 
      temperature probe (Circa S-Cath™). Of the 20 patients enrolled, 7 patients had
      paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AF), 8 persistent AF and 5 longstanding
      persistent AF. The average maximum luminal esophageal temperature observed was
      36.2 ± 0.7 °C (34.8–38.2 °C). In our clinical experience, no abrupt increase in
      the luminal esophageal temperature above the baseline was observed. Since no
      measurements exceeded the threshold of 39 °C, no prompt interruption of energy
      delivery was required. Intraluminal esophageal temperature monitoring is feasible
      and can be helpful in confirming correct catheter position and safe energy
      application in bipolar epicardial left atrial ablation. Intra-procedural
      preventive mitigations should be implemented to reduce the risk of esophageal
      temperature rises.

TI  - Evaluation of the Temple Touch Pro™ noninvasive core-temperature monitoring
      system in 100 adults under general anesthesia: a prospective comparison with
      esophageal temperature.
PG  - 29-36
AB  - Perioperative hypothermia is still common and has relevant complication for the
      patient. An effective perioperative thermal management requires essentially an
      accurate method to measure core temperature. So far, only one study has
      investigated the new Temple Touch Pro™ (Medisim Ltd., Beit-Shemesh, Israel).
      during anesthesia Therefore, we assessed the agreement between the Temple Touch
      Pro™ thermometer (TTP) and distal esophageal temperature (TEso) in a second
      study. After approval by the local ethics committee we studied 100 adult patients
      undergoing surgery with general anesthesia. Before induction of anesthesia the
      TTP sensor unit was attached to the skin above the temporal artery. After
      induction of anesthesia an esophageal temperature probe was placed in the distal 
      esophagus. Recordings started 10 min after placement of the esophageal
      temperature probe to allow adequate warming of the probes. Pairs of temperature
      values were documented in five-minute intervals until emergence of anesthesia.
      Accuracy of the two methods was assessed by Bland-Altman comparisons of
      differences with multiple measurements. Core temperatures obtained with the TTP
      in adults showed a mean bias of -0.04 °C with 95% limits of agreement within
      − 0.99 °C to + 0.91 °C compared to an esophageal temperature probe. We consider
      the TTP as a reasonable tool for perioperative temperature monitoring. It is not 
      accurate enough to be used as a reference method in scientific studies, but may
      be a useful tool especially for conscious patients undergoing neuraxial
      anesthesia or regional anesthesia with sedation.Trial registration This study was
      registered in the German Clinical Trials Register (DRKS-ID: 00024050), day of
      registration 12/01/2021.

TI  - Short-Term Natural Course of Esophageal Thermal Injury After Ablation for Atrial 
      Fibrillation.
PG  - 1450-9
AB  - Purpose:: To provide insight into the short-term natural history of esophageal
      thermal injury (ETI) after radiofrequency catheter ablation (RFCA) for atrial
      fibrillation (AF) by esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD). Methods:: We screened
      patients who underwent RFCA for AF and EGD based on esophageal late gadolinium
      enhancement (LGE) in post ablation MRI. Patients with ETI diagnosed with EGD were
      included. We defined severity of ETI according to Kansas City classification
      (KCC): type 1: erythema; type 2: ulcers (2a: superficial; 2b deep); type 3
      perforation (3a: perforation; 3b: perforation with atrioesophageal fistula).
      Repeated EGD was performed within 1–14 days after the last EGD if recommended and
      possible until any certain healing signs (visible reduction in size without
      deepening of ETI or complete resolution) were observed. Results:: ETI was
      observed in 62 of 378 patients who underwent EGD after RFCA. Out of these 62
      patients with ETI, 21% (13) were type 1, 50% (31) were type 2a and 29% (18) were 
      type 2b at the initial EGD. All esophageal lesions, but one type 2b lesion that
      developed into an atrioesophageal fistula (AEF), showed signs of healing in
      repeated EGD studies within 14 days after the procedure. The one type 2b lesion
      developing into an AEF showed an increase in size and ulcer deepening in repeat
      EGD 8 days after the procedure. Conclusion:.We found that all ETI which didn’t
      progress to AEF presented healing signs within 14 days after the procedure and
      that worsening ETI might be an early signal for developing esophageal
      perforation.

TI  - Protecting Against Collateral Damage to Non-cardiac Structures During Endocardial
      Ablation for Persistent Atrial Fibrillation.
LID - e15
AB  - Injury to structures adjacent to the heart, particularly oesophageal injury,
      accounts for a large proportion of fatal and life-altering complications of
      ablation for persistent AF. Avoiding these complications dictates many aspects of
      the way ablation is performed. Because avoidance involves limiting energy
      delivery in areas of interest, fear of extracardiac injury can impede the ability
      of the operator to perform an effective procedure. New techniques are becoming

TI  - Higher power short duration vs. lower power longer duration posterior wall
      ablation for atrial fibrillation and oesophageal injury outcomes: a prospective
      multi-centre randomized controlled study (Hi-Lo HEAT trial).
PG  - 417-24
AB  - Aims: Radiofrequency (RF) ablation for pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) in atrial
      fibrillation (AF) is associated with the risk of oesophageal thermal injury
      (ETI). Higher power short duration (HPSD) ablation results in preferential local 
      resistive heating over distal conductive heating. Although HPSD has become
      increasingly common, no randomized study has compared ETI risk with conventional 
      lower power longer duration (LPLD) ablation. This study aims to compare HPSD vs. 
      LPLD ablation on ETI risk. Methods and results: Eighty-eight patients were
      randomized 1:1 to HPSD or LPLD posterior wall (PW) ablation. Posterior wall
      ablation was 40 W (HPSD group) or 25 W (LPLD group), with target AI (ablation
      index) 400/LSI (lesion size index) 4. Anterior wall ablation was 40–50 W, with a 
      target AI 500–550/LSI 5–5.5. Endoscopy was performed on Day 1. The primary
      endpoint was ETI incidence. The mean age was 61 ± 9 years (31% females). The
      incidence of ETI (superficial ulcers n = 4) was 4.5%, with equal occurrence in
      HPSD and LPLD (P = 1.0). There was no difference in the median value of maximal
      oesophageal temperature (HPSD 38.6°C vs. LPLD 38.7°C, P = 0.43), or the median
      number of lesions per patient with temperature rise above 39°C (HPSD 1.5 vs. LPLD
      2, P = 0.93). Radiofrequency ablation time (23.8 vs. 29.7 min, P < 0.01), PVI
      duration (46.5 vs. 59 min, P = 0.01), and procedure duration (133 vs. 150 min, P 
      = 0.05) were reduced in HPSD. After a median follow-up of 12 months, AF
      recurrence was lower in HPSD (15.9% vs. LPLD 34.1%; hazard ratio 0.42, log-rank P
      = 0.04). Conclusion: Higher power short duration ablation was associated with
      similarly low rates of ETI and shorter total/PVI RF ablation times when compared 
      with LPLD ablation. Higher power short duration ablation is a safe and
      efficacious approach to PVI.

TI  - A Simplified Approach to Pulmonary Vein Visualization during Cryoballoon Ablation
      of Atrial Fibrillation.
LID - 1700
AB  - Background and Objectives: Selective pulmonary vein (PV) angiography has been
      established as the gold standard for PV visualization in cryoballoon (CB)-based
      pulmonary vein isolation (PVI). We sought to simplify this approach to reduce
      procedural complexity and radiation exposure. Materials and Methods: Patients
      with paroxysmal and recently diagnosed persistent AF undergoing CB-based PVI from
      January 2015 to December 2017 were retrospectively analyzed. Patients underwent
      either selective PV angiography or conventional left atrial (LA) angiography for 
      PV visualization. Results: A total of 336 patients were analyzed. A total of 87
      patients (26%) received PV angiography and 249 (74%) LA angiography. LA
      angiography required fewer cine-sequences for PV visualization, translating into 
      a significant reduction in procedure duration, fluoroscopy time and dose area
      product. Additionally, less contrast medium was utilized. PV occlusion by the CB,
      CB temperature and time to isolation showed no significant differences. The
      number of CB applications and total application time (LA angiography: 1.4 ± 0.02 
      vs. PV Angiography: 1.6 ± 0.05; p < 0.0001; LA angiography: 297.9 ± 4.62 vs.
      PV-Angiography: 348.9 ± 11.03; p < 0.001, respectively) per vein were slightly
      but significantly higher in the PV angiography group. We observed no difference
      in late AF recurrence (24.7% LA angiography vs. 21.3% PV angiography; p =
      0.2657). Conclusions: A simplified protocol, using LA angiography for PV
      visualization, entails a reduction in procedure time and radiation exposure while
      equally maintaining procedural efficiency and safety in both groups.

TI  - A worldwide survey on incidence, management, and prognosis of oesophageal fistula
      formation following atrial fibrillation catheter ablation: the POTTER-AF study.
PG  - 2458-69
AB  - Aims: Oesophageal fistula represents a rare but dreadful complication of atrial
      fibrillation catheter ablation. Data on its incidence, management, and outcome
      are sparse. Methods and results: This international multicentre registry
      investigates the characteristics of oesophageal fistulae after treatment of
      atrial fibrillation by catheter ablation. A total of 553 729 catheter ablation
      procedures (radiofrequency: 62.9%, cryoballoon: 36.2%, other modalities: 0.9%)
      were performed, at 214 centres in 35 countries. In 78 centres 138 patients
      [0.025%, radiofrequency: 0.038%, cryoballoon: 0.0015% (P < 0.0001)] were
      diagnosed with an oesophageal fistula. Peri-procedural data were available for
      118 patients (85.5%). Following catheter ablation, the median time to symptoms
      and the median time to diagnosis were 18 (7.75, 25; range: 0–60) days and 21 (15,
      29.5; range: 2–63) days, respectively. The median time from symptom onset to
      oesophageal fistula diagnosis was 3 (1, 9; range: 0–42) days. The most common
      initial symptom was fever (59.3%). The diagnosis was established by chest
      computed tomography in 80.2% of patients. Oesophageal surgery was performed in
      47.4% and direct endoscopic treatment in 19.8% and conservative treatment in
      32.8% of patients. The overall mortality was 65.8%. Mortality following surgical 
      (51.9%) or endoscopic treatment (56.5%) was significantly lower as compared to
      conservative management (89.5%) [odds ratio 7.463 (2.414, 23.072) P < 0.001].
      Conclusion: Oesophageal fistula after catheter ablation of atrial fibrillation is
      rare and occurs mostly with the use of radiofrequency energy rather than
      cryoenergy. Mortality without surgical or endoscopic intervention is exceedingly 
      high.

TI  - Role of oesophageal cooling in the prevention of oesophageal injury in atrial
      fibrillation catheter ablation: a systematic review and meta-analysis of
      randomized controlled trials.
LID - euad080
AB  - Aims: To evaluate the efficacy of oesophageal cooling in the prevention of
      oesophageal injury in patients undergoing atrial fibrillation (AF) catheter
      ablation. Methods and results: Comprehensive search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, and
      Cochrane databases through April 2022 for randomized controlled trials (RCTs)
      evaluating the role of oesophageal cooling compared with control in the
      prevention of oesophageal injury during AF catheter ablation. The study primary
      outcome was the incidence of any oesophageal injury. The meta-analysis included 4
      RCTs with a total of 294 patients. There was no difference in the incidence of
      any oesophageal injury between oesophageal cooling and control [15% vs. 19%;
      relative risk (RR) 0.86; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.31–2.41]. Compared with
      control, oesophageal cooling showed lower risk of severe oesophageal injury (1.5%
      vs. 9%; RR 0.21; 95% CI 0.05–0.80). There were no significant differences among
      the two groups in mild to moderate oesophageal injury (13.6% vs. 12.1%; RR 1.09; 
      95% CI 0.28–4.23), procedure duration [standardized mean difference (SMD) −0.03; 
      95% CI −0.36–0.30], posterior wall radiofrequency (RF) time (SMD 0.27; 95% CI
      −0.04–0.58), total RF time (SMD −0.50; 95% CI −1.15–0.16), acute reconnection
      incidence (RR 0.93; 95% CI 0.02–36.34), and ablation index (SMD 0.16; 95% CI
      −0.33–0.66). Conclusion: Among patients undergoing AF catheter ablation,
      oesophageal cooling did not reduce the overall risk of any oesophageal injury
      compared with control. Oesophageal cooling might shift the severity of
      oesophageal injuries to less severe injuries. Further studies should evaluate the
      long-term effects after oesophageal cooling during AF catheter ablation.

TI  - Pulsed field ablation using focal contact force-sensing catheters for treatment
      of atrial fibrillation: acute and 90-day invasive remapping results.
LID - euad147
AB  - Aims: Pulsed field ablation (PFA) has emerged as a promising alternative to
      thermal ablation for treatment of atrial fibrillation (AF). We report performance
      and safety using the CENTAURI™ System (Galvanize Therapeutics) with three
      commercial, focal ablation catheters. Methods and results: ECLIPSE AF
      (NCT04523545) was a prospective, single-arm, multi-centre study evaluating safety
      and acute and chronic pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) durability using the
      CENTAURI System in conjunction with the TactiCath SE, StablePoint, and ThermoCool
      ST ablation catheters. Patients with paroxysmal or persistent AF were treated at 
      two centres. Patients were analysed in five cohorts based upon ablation settings,
      catheter, and mapping system. Pulsed field ablation was performed in 82 patients 
      (74% male, 42 paroxysmal AF). Pulmonary vein isolation was achieved in 100% of
      pulmonary veins (322/322) with first-pass isolation in 92.2% (297/322). There
      were four serious adverse events of interest (three vascular access complications
      and one lacunar stroke). Eighty patients (98%) underwent invasive remapping.
      Pulsed field ablation development Cohorts 1 and 2 showed a per-patient isolation 
      rate of 38% and 26% and a per-PV isolation rate of 47% and 53%, respectively.
      Optimized PFA Cohorts 3–5 showed a per-patient isolation rate of 60%, 73%, and
      81% and a per-PV isolation rate of 84%, 90%, and 92%, respectively. Conclusion:
      ECLIPSE AF demonstrated that optimized PFA using the CENTAURI System with three
      commercial, contact force-sensing, solid-tip focal ablation catheters resulted in
      transmural lesion formation and high proportion of durable PVI with a favourable 
      safety profile, thus providing a viable treatment option for AF that integrates
      with contemporary focal ablation workflows.

TI  - Comparison of tracheal temperature and core temperature measurement in living
      donor liver transplant recipients: a clinical comparative study.
LID - 315
AB  - Background: Body temperature is a vital sign, and temperature monitoring during
      liver transplantation is important. Tracheal temperature can be measured via an
      endotracheal tube with a temperature sensor on the cuff of the tube. This study
      aimed to investigate the accuracy and trending ability of tracheal temperature
      measurement compared to those of the core temperature measured at the esophagus
      and pulmonary artery (PA) in living donor liver transplant recipients. Methods:
      Twenty-two patients who underwent living donor liver transplantation (LDLT) were 
      enrolled. Patients were intubated using an endotracheal tube with a temperature
      sensor placed on the inner surface of the tube cuff. Tracheal, esophageal, and PA
      temperatures were recorded at five time points corresponding to the different
      phases of liver transplantation. The tracheal and esophageal, tracheal and PA,
      and esophageal and PA temperatures were compared using Bland–Altman analysis,
      four-quadrant plot/concordance analysis, and polar plot analysis. Results:
      Bland–Altman analysis showed an overall mean bias (95% limits of agreement)
      between tracheal and esophageal temperatures of -0.10 °C (-0.37 °C to 0.18 °C),
      with a percentage error of 0.27%; between tracheal and PA temperatures, -0.05 °C 
      (-0.91 °C to 0.20 °C), with a percentage error of -0.15%; and between esophageal 
      and PA temperatures, 0.04 °C (-0.27 °C to 0.35 °C), with a percentage error of
      0.12%. The concordance rates between tracheal and esophageal temperatures,
      tracheal and PA temperatures, and esophageal and PA temperatures were 96.2%,
      96.2%, and 94.94%, respectively. The polar plot analysis showed a mean angular
      bias (radial limits of agreement) of 4° (26°), -3° (13°), and 2° (21°).
      Conclusions: Monitoring core temperature at the inner surface of the endotracheal
      tube cuff is accurate in all phases of LDLT with good trending ability; thus, it 
      can be an excellent alternative for monitoring during LDLTs.

TI  - Pulsed field ablation based pulmonary vein isolation utilizing a simplified
      approach.
LID - euad122.089
AB  - Funding Acknowledgements: Type of funding sources: None. Background: Pulsed field
      ablation (PFA) is a novel non-thermal energy source with promising safety and
      efficacy advantages compared to standard ablation technologies. Purpose: We aimed
      to develop a safe, effective and fast pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) utilizing a 
      single shot PFA catheter via a single femoral vein puncture and a venous closure 
      system approach. Methods: Forty-eight consecutive AF patients underwent
      first-time PVI via PFA under deep sedation. A single ultrasound guided femoral
      vein puncture and a single transseptal puncture was utilized for left atrial
      access. After pulmonary vein (PV) angiography eight pulse trains (2kV/2.5 sec,
      bipolar, biphasic, each 4x basket/flower configuration) were delivered to each
      PV. Extra pulse trains in the flower configuration (8x) were added to the
      posterior wall for very wide antral circumferential ablation (vWACA). Continuous 
      intraluminal esophageal temperature (TESO) was monitored with a s-shaped
      esophageal temperature probe. A venous closure system was utilized on the single 
      access site. A Donati suture was performed. The pressure bandage was removed
      after 1h. Results: Patients (mean age: 64 +/-11 years) presented with AF
      (paroxysmal 58% or persistent AF (42%). A total of 192 PV were identified and
      isolated via PFA (100%). A mean of 40 pulse trains for PVI and vWACA have been
      used. The mean procedural time was 27 +/- 7 minutes, the mean catheter dwell time
      was 14 +/- 6 minutes and the median fluoroscopy time was 6 +/- 2 minutes. No
      relevant esophagus temperature rise occurred. One patient (2%) experienced a
      transient phrenic nerve palsy which recovered until the end of the procedure. Two
      patients (4%) experienced a superficial bleeding which was treated by a figure of
      eight suture. No severed hematoma, transfusion or intervention was necessary. No 
      pericardial effusion or tamponade occurred. Conclusion: The combination of a
      single vein single transseptal puncture approach resulted in a 100% rate of acute
      PVI and an extraordinary fast procedure and dwell time. The rate of
      periprocedural complications was low.

TI  - Thoracic Paravertebral Block Decreased Body Temperature in Thoracoscopic
      Lobectomy Patients: A Randomized Controlled Trial.
PG  - 67-76
AB  - Purpose: Thoracic paravertebral block (TPVB) may be highly beneficial for
      thoracoscopic lobectomy patients, but it may increase the risk of hypothermia.
      Apart from its anesthetic-reducing effects, this randomized controlled trial
      aimed to investigate the hypothermic effect of TPVB, and thus optimize its
      clinical use. Patients and methods: Adult patients were randomly allocated to two
      groups: TPVB + general anesthesia (GA) group or GA group. In the TPVB+GA group,
      the block was performed after GA induction by an experienced but unrelated
      anesthesiologist. Both the lower esophageal and axillary temperature were
      recorded at the beginning of surgery (T0) and every 15 min thereafter (T1-T8),
      and the end of surgery (Tp). The primary outcome was the lower esophageal
      temperature at Tp. The secondary outcomes included lower esophageal temperature
      from T0-T8 and axillary temperature from T0-Tp. The total propofol, analgesics,
      and norepinephrine consumption and the incidence of adverse events were also
      recorded. Results: Forty-eight patients were randomly allocated to the TPVB+GA
      (n=24) and GA (n=24) groups. The core temperature at the end of the surgery was
      lower in the TPVB+GA group than the GA group (35.90±0.30°C vs 36.35±0.33°C,
      P<0.001), with a significant difference from 45 min after the surgery began until
      the end of the surgery (P<0.05). In contrast, the peripheral temperature showed a
      significant difference at 60 min after the surgery began till the end (P<0.05).
      TPVB+GA exhibited excellent analgesic and sedative-sparing effects compared to GA
      alone (P<0.001), though it increased norepinephrine consumption due to
      hypotension (P<0.001). Conclusion: Although thorough warming strategies were
      used, TPVB combined with GA remarkably reduced the body temperature, which is an 
      easily neglected side effect. Further studies on the most effective precautions
      are needed to optimize the clinical use of TPVB.

TI  - Optimal Insertion Depth of Gastric Decompression Tube with a Thermistor for
      Patients Undergoing Laparoscopic Surgery in Trendelenburg Position.
LID - 14708
AB  - Monitoring core temperature is crucial for maintaining normothermia during
      general anesthesia. Insertion of a gastric decompression tube (GDT) may be
      required during laparoscopic surgery. Recently, a newly designed GDT with a
      thermistor for monitoring esophageal temperature has been introduced. The purpose
      of the present study was to evaluate the optimal insertion depth of a GDT with a 
      thermistor. Forty-eight patients undergoing elective laparoscopic surgery in the 
      Trendelenburg position were included in the study. The GDT was inserted to a
      depth of nose–earlobe–xiphoid distance (NEX) + 12 cm and withdrawn sequentially, 
      2 cm at a time, at 5-min intervals. Temperatures of the GDT thermistor were
      compared with the core temperature of the tympanic membrane (TM) using Bland and 
      Altman analysis. The correlation between optimal insertion depth of the GDT and
      anatomical distance (cricoid cartilage to the carina, CCD; carina to the left
      hemidiaphragm, CLHD) was evaluated, and a mathematical model to predict the
      optimal insertion depth of the GDT with a thermistor was calculated. Temperatures
      of TM and GDT thermistor at NEX + 4 cm showed good agreement and strong
      correlation, but better agreement and stronger correlation were seen at the
      actual location with the most minor temperature differences. The optimal
      insertion depth of the GDT was estimated as −15.524 + 0.414 × CCD − 0.145 × CLHD 
      and showed a strong correlation with the actual GDT insertion depth (correlation 
      coefficient 0.797, adjusted R2 = 0.636). The mathematical formula using CCD and
      CLHD would be helpful in determining the optimal insertion depth of a GDT with a 
      thermistor.

TI  - Prospective comparative analysis of noninvasive body temperature monitoring using
      zero heat flux technology (SpotOn sensor) compared with esophageal temperature
      monitoring during pediatric surgery.
LID - e0272720
AB  - Maintaining body temperature in pediatric patients is critical, but it is often
      difficult to use currently accepted core temperature measurement methods. Several
      studies have validated the use of the SpotOn sensor for measuring core
      temperature in adults, but studies on pediatric patients are still lacking. The
      aim of this study was to investigate the accuracy of the SpotOn sensor compared
      with that of esophageal temperature measurement in pediatric patients
      intraoperatively. Children aged 1–8 years with American Society of Anesthesiology
      Physical Condition Classification I or II scheduled to undergo elective ear
      surgery for at least 30 min under general anesthesia were enrolled. Body core
      temperature was measured every 15 min after induction till the end of anesthesia 
      with an esophageal probe, axillary probe, and SpotOn sensor. We included 49
      patients, providing a total 466 paired measurements. Analysis of Pearson rank
      correlation between SpotOn and esophageal pairs showed a correlation coefficient 
      (r) of 0.93 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.92–0.94). Analysis of Pearson rank
      correlation between esophageal and axillary pairs gave a correlation coefficient 
      (r) of 0.89 (95% CI 0.87–0.91). Between the SpotOn and esophageal groups,
      Bland-Altman analysis revealed a bias (SD, 95% limits of agreement) of -0.07
      (0.17 [-0.41–0.28]). Between the esophageal and axillary groups, Bland-Altman
      analysis showed a bias (SD, 95% limits of agreement) of 0.45 (0.22 [0–0.89]). In 
      pediatric patients during surgery, the SpotOn sensor showed high correlation and 
      agreement with the esophageal probe, which is a representative core temperature
      measurement method.

TI  - Safety of continuous left atrial phased-array intracardiac echocardiography
      during left atrial ablation for atrial fibrillation.
PG  - 673-80
AB  - Background: Pulmonary vein (PV) isolation using radiofrequency ablation (RFA) to 
      treat atrial fibrillation (AF) requires delivery of contiguous transmural lesions
      at the PV antra while avoiding injury to the esophagus. Continuous 2-dimensional 
      phased-array intracardiac echocardiography (ICE) from within the left atrium (LA)
      can provide consistent high-resolution images of catheter tip contact and
      location during ablation. Objective: The purpose of this study was to compare
      near-term safety outcomes of therapeutic AF ablation with and without ICE imaging
      from within the LA. Methods: The study cohort included 590 consecutive patients
      undergoing RFA for AF including continuous ICE imaging during ablation from
      within either the right atrium (RA) or the LA. Subjects were followed
      prospectively, and periprocedural complications within 30 days were identified
      and recorded. Results: All subjects had RA ICE imaging to guide transseptal
      catheterization. Ultrasound imaging from both RA and LA was used in 243 (41.2%). 
      Respectively, the LA vs RA only imaging cohorts were comparable with respect to
      age (median 64 [interquartile range 57.4–71.2] years vs 64 [56.2–70.6] years; P =
      .425); history of hypertension (64.0% vs 67.2%; P = .421); diabetes mellitus
      (23.1% vs 19.4%; P = .268); previous cerebrovascular accident/transient ischemic 
      attack (10.8% vs 8.4%; P = .331); and AF type (P = .241). There were no
      significant differences in major complications within 30 days between the 2
      cohorts (P = .649) and no identified cases of esophageal or phrenic nerve injury 
      or PV stenosis. Conclusions: Routine continuous LA ICE imaging seems to be safe
      and holds potential to facilitate lesion delivery during RFA for AF.

TI  - Nine golden codes: improving the accuracy of Helicopter Emergency Medical
      Services (HEMS) dispatch—a retrospective, multi-organisational study in the East 
      of England.
LID - 27
AB  - Background: Helicopter Emergency Medical Services (HEMS) are a limited and
      expensive resource, and should be intelligently tasked. HEMS dispatch was
      identified as a key research priority in 2011, with a call to identify a ‘general
      set of criteria with the highest discriminating potential’. However, there have
      been no published data analyses in the past decade that specifically address this
      priority, and this priority has been reaffirmed in 2023. The objective of this
      study was to define the dispatch criteria available at the time of the initial
      emergency call with the greatest HEMS utility using a large, regional,
      multi-organizational dataset in the UK. Methods: This retrospective observational
      study utilized dispatch data from a regional emergency medical service (EMS) and 
      three HEMS organisations in the East of England, 2016–2019. In a logistic
      regression model, Advanced Medical Priority Dispatch System (AMPDS) codes
      with ≥ 50 HEMS dispatches in the study period were compared with the remainder to
      identify codes with high-levels of HEMS patient contact and HEMS-level
      intervention/drug/diagnostic (HLIDD). The primary outcome was to identify AMPDS
      codes with a > 10% HEMS dispatch rate of all EMS taskings that would result in
      10–20 high-utility HEMS dispatches per 24-h period in the East of England. Data
      were analysed in R, and are reported as number (percentage); significance was
      p < 0.05. Results: There were n = 25,491 HEMS dispatches (6400 per year), of
      which n = 23,030 (90.3%) had an associated AMPDS code. n = 13,778 (59.8%) of HEMS
      dispatches resulted in patient contact, and n = 8437 (36.6%) had an HLIDD. 43
      AMPDS codes had significantly greater rates of patient contact and/or HLIDD
      compared to the reference group. In an exploratory analysis, a cut-off of ≥ 70%
      patient contact rate and/or ≥ 70% HLIDD (with a > 10% HEMS dispatch of all EMS
      taskings) resulted in 17 taskings per 24-h period. This definition derived nine
      AMPDS codes with high HEMS utility. Conclusion: We have identified nine ‘golden’ 
      AMPDS codes, available at the time of initial emergency call, that are associated
      with high-levels of whole-system and HEMS utility in the East of England. We
      propose that UK EMS should consider immediate HEMS dispatch to these codes.

TI  - Personalized pulmonary vein antrum isolation guided by left atrial wall thickness
      for persistent atrial fibrillation.
LID - euad118
AB  - Aims: Pulmonary vein (PV) antrum isolation proved to be effective for treating
      persistent atrial fibrillation (PeAF). We sought to investigate the results of a 
      personalized approach aimed at adapting the ablation index (AI) to the local left
      atrial wall thickness (LAWT) in a cohort of consecutive patients with PeAF.
      Methods and results: Consecutive patients referred for PeAF first ablation were
      prospectively enrolled. The LAWT three-dimensional maps were obtained from
      pre-procedure multidetector computed tomography and integrated into the
      navigation system. Ablation index was titrated according to the local LAWT, and
      the ablation line was personalized to avoid the thickest regions while encircling
      the PV antrum. A total of 121 patients (69.4% male, age 64.5 ± 9.5 years) were
      included. Procedure time was 57 min (IQR 50–67), fluoroscopy time was 43 s (IQR
      20–71), and radiofrequency (RF) time was 16.5 min (IQR 14.3–18.4). The median AI 
      tailored to the local LAWT was 387 (IQR 360–410) for the anterior wall and 335
      (IQR 300–375) for the posterior wall. First-pass PV antrum isolation was obtained
      in 103 (85%) of the right PVs and 103 (85%) of the left PVs. Median LAWT values
      were higher for PVs without first-pass isolation as compared to the whole cohort 
      (P = 0.02 for left PVs and P = 0.03 for right PVs). Recurrence-free survival was 
      79% at 12 month follow-up. Conclusion: In this prospective study, LAWT-guided PV 
      antrum isolation for PeAF was effective and efficient, requiring low procedure,
      fluoroscopy, and RF time. A randomized trial comparing the LAWT-guided ablation
      with the standard of practice is in progress (ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT05396534).

TI  - Efficacy and safety in patients treated with a novel radiofrequency balloon: a
      two centres experience from the AURORA collaboration.
LID - euad106
AB  - Aims: A novel irrigated radiofrequency (RF) balloon (RFB) for pulmonary vein (PV)
      isolation (PVI) was released in selected centres. We pooled the procedural data
      on efficacy and safety of RFB-PVI from two high volume German centres. Methods
      and results: Consecutive patients with RFB procedures were enrolled. A 3D
      electroanatomical left atrial map guided the RFB navigation. Every RF delivery
      lasted 60 s, and duration was automatically reduced to 20 s for electrodes facing
      the posterior wall. Procedural data and post-procedural endoscopy data (<48 h)
      were analysed. Data from 140 patients were collected (57% male, 67 ± 11 years,
      57% paroxysmal atrial fibrillation). There were 547 PVs identified, and 99.1%
      could be isolated using solely the RFB. Single-shot PVI was recorded in 330/547
      (60%) PVs. Median time to isolation during the first application was 10 s (IQR
      8–13). A total of 2.1 ± 1.8 applications per PV were delivered, with the left
      superior PV requiring more application compared to other PVs. Median procedure
      and fluoroscopy time were 77 min (61–99) and 13 min (10–17), respectively. Major 
      safety events were recorded only in the first 25 cases at each centre and
      included 1/140(0.7%) cardiac tamponade, 1/140(0.7%) phrenic nerve palsy, and
      2/140 strokes (1.4%). An oesophageal temperature rise was recorded in 81/547
      (15%) PVs, and endoscopy detected oesophageal lesions in 7/85 (8%) patients
      undergoing endoscopy. Conclusion: The RFB showed a high efficacy allowing for
      fast PVI procedures, and 60% of PVs could be isolated at the first application.
      Most safety events were recorded during the learning phase. An oesophageal
      temperature monitoring is suggested: oesophageal lesions were detected in 8% of
      patients.

TI  - Interventions to prevent hypothermia in extremely preterm low-weight infants
      undergoing cardiac catheterisation.
LID - e001773
AB  - Background: In January 2019, a new device called the Amplatzer Piccolo Occluder
      was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for percutaneous closure of
      patent ductus arteriosus in infants weighing more than 700 g and of postnatal age
      more than 3 days. Premature low-weight infants are predisposed to hypothermia
      when transported outside of the thermo-neutral environment. At our institution,
      90% of extremely preterm low-weight infants developed transient moderate
      hypothermia in the cardiac catheterisation suite. Methods: We conducted a study
      testing multiple hypotheses aimed at preventing hypothermia in the cardiac
      catheterisation suite. Interventions included increasing ambient room
      temperature, reducing exposure to cold environment and reducing overall time
      spent in the remote location. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients 
      who developed transient hypothermia at the start of the procedure in the cardiac 
      catheterisation suite. The secondary measures included mean core body temperature
      at four different instances, as well as anaesthesia time, procedure time and
      radiation exposure. Results: During the study period, 10 patients were enrolled
      in each group. The postintervention group saw a reduction in transient
      hypothermia from 90% to 40% (absolute risk reduction 50%, p=0.02). Data analysis 
      showed an improvement in mean core body temperature (35.4°C vs 36.4°C, p<0.01) as
      well as a smaller percentage drop in temperature (4% vs 1.3%, p<0.01) between the
      two groups, both of which were statistically significant. The anaesthesia time,
      procedure time and radiation exposure reduced between the two groups. Conclusion:
      The application of the interventions reduced hypothermia in this high-risk
      population. The implementation of a protocol with collaboration of a
      multidisciplinary team is indispensable in providing optimal care to extremely
      preterm infants.

TI  - Very high-power short-duration ablation for pulmonary vein isolation utilizing a 
      very-close protocol—the FAST AND FURIOUS PVI study.
PG  - 880-8
AB  - Aims: The very high-power short-duration (vHP-SD) radiofrequency (RF) ablation
      concept of atrial fibrillation (AF) treatment by pulmonary vein isolation (PVI)
      aims for safer, more effective, and faster procedures. Utilizing conventional
      ablation, the ‘close protocol’ has been verified. Since lesion formation of
      vHP-SD ablation creates wider but shallower lesions we adapted the close protocol
      to an individualized and tighter ‘very-close protocol’ of 3–4 mm of inter-lesion 
      distance (ILD) at the anterior and 5–6 mm at the posterior aspect of the left
      atrium using vHP-SD only. Here, we evaluated the safety and efficacy of vHP-SD
      ablation for PVI utilizing a very-close protocol in comparison with standard
      ablation. Methods and results: A total of 50 consecutive patients with
      symptomatic AF were treated with a very-close protocol utilizing vHP-SD (vHP-SD
      group). The data were compared with 50 consecutive patients treated by the
      ablation-index-guided strategy (control group). The mean RF time was 352 ± 81 s
      (vHP-SD) and 1657 ± 570 s (control, P < 0.0001), and the mean procedure duration 
      was 59 ± 13 (vHP-SD) and 101 ± 38 (control, P < 0.0001). The first-pass isolation
      rate was 74% (vHP-SD) and 76% (control, P = 0.817). Severe adverse events were
      reported in 1 (2%, vHP-SD) and 3 (6%, control) patients (P = 0.307). A 12-month
      recurrence-free survival was 78% (vHP-SD) and 64% (control, P = 0.142). PVI
      durability assessed during redo-procedures was 75% (vHP-SD) vs. 33% (control, P <
      0.001). Conclusions: PVI solely utilizing vHP-SD via a very-close protocol
      provides safe and effective procedures with a high rate of first-pass isolations.
      The procedure duration and ablation time were remarkably low. A 12-month
      follow-up and PVI durability are promising.

      catheter ablation of atrial fibrillation: an EHRA survey.
PG  - 667-75
AB  - Catheter ablation (CA) of atrial fibrillation (AF) is the therapy of choice for
      the maintenance of sinus rhythm in patients with symptomatic AF. Time towards
      interventional treatment and peri-procedural management of patients undergoing AF
      ablation may vary in daily practice. The scope of this European Heart Rhythm
      Association (EHRA) survey was to report the current clinical practice regarding
      the management of patients undergoing AF ablation and physician’s adherence to
      the European Society of Cardiology Guidelines and the EHRA/HRS/ECAS expert
      consensus statement on the CA for AF. This physician-based survey was conducted
      among EHRA members, using an internet-based questionnaire developed by the EHRA
      Scientific Initiatives Committee. A total of 258 physicians participated in the
      survey. In patients with paroxysmal or persistent AF, 42 and 9% of the physicians
      would routinely perform AF ablation as first-line therapy respectively, whereas
      71% of physicians would consider ablation as first-line therapy in patients with 
      symptomatic AF and left ventricular ejection fraction <35%. Only 14% of the
      respondents manage cardiovascular risk factors in patients referred for CA using 
      a dedicated AF risk factor management programme. Radiofrequency CA is the
      preferred technology for first-time AF (56%), followed by cryo-balloon CA (40%). 
      This EHRA survey demonstrated a considerable variation in the management of
      patients undergoing AF ablation in routine practice and deviations between
      guideline recommendations and clinical practice.

TI  - Interhemispheric competition during sleep.
PG  - 312-8
AB  - Our understanding of the functions and mechanisms of sleep remains incomplete,
      reflecting their increasingly evident complexity1–3. Likewise, studies of
      interhemispheric coordination during sleep4–6 are often hard to connect precisely
      to known sleep circuits and mechanisms. Here, by recording from the claustra of
      sleeping bearded dragons (Pogona vitticeps), we show that, although the onsets
      and offsets of Pogona rapid-eye-movement (REMP) and slow-wave sleep are
      coordinated bilaterally, these two sleep states differ markedly in their
      inter-claustral coordination. During slow-wave sleep, the claustra produce
      sharp-wave ripples independently of one another, showing no coordination. By
      contrast, during REMP sleep, the potentials produced by the two claustra are
      precisely coordinated in amplitude and time. These signals, however, are not
      synchronous: one side leads the other by about 20 ms, with the leading side
      switching typically once per REMP episode or in between successive episodes. The 
      leading claustrum expresses the stronger activity, suggesting bilateral
      competition. This competition does not occur directly between the two claustra or
      telencephalic hemispheres. Rather, it occurs in the midbrain and depends on the
      integrity of a GABAergic (γ-aminobutyric-acid-producing) nucleus of the isthmic
      complex, which exists in all vertebrates and is known in birds to underlie
      bottom-up attention and gaze control. These results reveal that a
      winner-take-all-type competition exists between the two sides of the brain of
      Pogona, which originates in the midbrain and has precise consequences for
      claustrum activity and coordination during REMP sleep.

TI  - Pulmonary vein isolation with the radiofrequency balloon catheter: a single
      centre prospective study.
PG  - 896-904
AB  - Aims: The multielectrode radiofrequency balloon catheter (RFB) has been developed
      to achieve safe and effective pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) for atrial
      fibrillation (AF) ablation. This single-centre study aimed to evaluate the
      midterm clinical outcome and predictors of single-shot PVI with the novel RFB.
      Methods and results: All consecutive patients with symptomatic paroxysmal or
      persistent AF undergoing first-time PVI with the RFB were prospectively included.
      Clinical and procedural parameters were systematically collected. The primary
      safety endpoint was defined as any major periprocedural complications. The
      primary efficacy endpoint consisted of freedom from any atrial tachyarrhythmias
      (ATas) lasting >30 s during the follow-up after a 3-month blanking period.
      Persistent single-shot PVI was defined as PVI achieved with a single RFB
      application without acute reconnection. A total of 104 consecutive patients (mean
      age 64.3 ± 11.4 years, 56.7% males) were included. 15 patients (14.4%) presented 
      with persistent AF. The procedure time was 59.0 min with a dwell time of 20.0
      min. One major complication occurred in one patient. At a mean follow-up of 10.1 
      ± 5.3 months, freedom from ATas was 82.9%. ATas occurred in 14 patients, 11/69
      patients (15.9%) with paroxysmal AF and 3/13 (23.1%) with persistent AF. The best
      cut-offs to predict persistent single-shot PVI were impedance drop >19.2 Ω [area 
      under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC) 0.74] and temperature rise
      >11.1° C (AUC 0.77). Conclusion: In a large cohort of patients undergoing PVI
      with the RFB, the complication rate was 1%. At a mid-term follow-up of 10.1 ± 5.3
      months, freedom from ATas was 82.9%. Specific cut-offs of impedance drop and
      temperature rise may be useful to predict persistent single-shot isolation.

TI  - Initial experience with pulsed field ablation for atrial fibrillation.
LID - 959186
AB  - Introduction: Pulsed field ablation (PFA) was recently introduced for the
      treatment of symptomatic atrial fibrillation (AF) with the claim of selectively
      ablating the myocardium while sparing surrounding tissues. We present our initial
      experience with a PFA catheter for pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) and describe
      procedural findings and peri-procedural safety of the first 100 patients.
      Materials and methods: We investigated 100 patients treated for symptomatic AF
      using the FARAWAVE PFA catheter (Farapulse, Menlo Park, CA, USA) between July
      2021 and March 2022. Procedure workflow and electrophysiological findings at the 
      time of ablation, peri-procedural complications, and operator learning curves are
      described. Results: The mean age of patients was 62.9 ± 9.4 years, 62% were male 
      subjects and 80% had paroxysmal AF. The median CHA2DS2-VASc score was 1.5 (IQR:
      1.0–2.0) and the mean left atrial volume index was 35.7 ± 9.6 ml/m2. In 88 (88%) 
      patients, PVI alone was performed and in 12 (12%) patients additional ablation of
      the posterior wall was performed. 3D-electroanatomic mapping was performed in 18 
      (18%) patients. Procedures without mapping lasted for 52.3 ± 16.6 min. The mean
      number of applications per pulmonary vein (PV) was 8.1 ± 0.6. In all patients
      (100%), all PVs were confirmed to be isolated. The learning curves of the two
      operators who performed > 20 procedures showed a negligible variation of
      performance over time and practice did not significantly predict procedure time
      [Operator 1 (senior): R2 = 0.034, p = 0.35; Operator 2 (junior): R2 = 0.004, p = 
      0.73]. There was no difference between the procedure times between senior and
      junior operators (Operator 1: 46.9 ± 9.7 min vs. Operator 2: 45.9 ± 9.9 min; p = 
      0.73). The only complications observed were two cases of bleeding at the site of 
      percutaneous access. Conclusion: Our initial experience shows that use of the PFA
      catheter for pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) is safe, fast, and easy to learn.

TI  - Spontaneous pneumothorax after shoulder arthroscopy under general anesthesia: a
      case report.
LID - 03000605231189367
AB  - A woman in her early 70s presented with a right fifth rib fracture along with
      left scapular body and glenoid fractures resulting from a traffic accident. She
      had no history of lung disease. The patient underwent multi-incisional
      video-guided arthroscopic fracture reduction and screw fixation in the right
      lateral decubitus position under general anesthesia, and surgery was followed by 
      chest tube insertion. Left-sided pneumothorax was found during routine
      postoperative radiography despite the absence of relevant symptoms or signs such 
      as hypoxia, chest pain, or respiratory difficulty. We herein report this unusual 
      case with a brief literature review.

TI  - Shorter Distance Between The Esophagus And The Left Atrium Is Associated With
      Higher Rates Of Esophageal Thermal Injury After Radiofrequency Ablation.
PG  - 1460-71
AB  - Background:: Esophageal thermal injury (ETI) is a known and potentially serious
      complication of catheter ablation for atrial fibrillation. We intended to
      evaluate the distance between the esophagus and the left atrium posterior wall
      (LAPW) and its association with esophageal thermal injury. Methods:: A
      retrospective analysis of 73 patients who underwent esophagogastroduodenoscopy
      (EGD) after LA radiofrequency catheter ablation for symptomatic atrial
      fibrillation and pre-ablation magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was used to
      identify the minimum distance between the inner lumen of the esophagus and the
      ablated atrial endocardium (pre-ablation atrial esophageal distance; pre-AED) and
      occurrence of ETI. Parameters of ablation index (AI, Visitag Surpoint) were
      collected in 30 patients from the CARTO3 system and compared to assess if
      ablation strategies and AI further impacted risk of ETI. Results:: Pre-AED was
      significantly larger in patients without ETI than those with ETI (5.23 ± 0.96 mm 
      vs 4.31 ± 0.75 mm, p < 0.001). Pre-AED showed high accuracy for predicting ETI
      with the best cutoff value of 4.37 mm. AI was statistically comparable between
      Visitag lesion markers with and without associated esophageal late gadolinium
      enhancement (LGE) detected by post-ablation MRI in the low-power long-duration
      ablation group (LPLD, 25–40W for 10 to 30 s, 393.16 [308.62, 408.86] versus
      406.58 [364.38, 451.22], p = 0.16) and high-power short-duration group (HPSD, 50W
      for 5–10 s, 336.14 [299.66, 380.11] versus 330.54 [286.21, 384.71], p = 0.53),
      respectively. Conclusion:: Measuring the distance between the LA and the
      esophagus in pre-ablation LGE-MRI could be helpful in predicting ETI after LAPW
      ablation.

TI  - Ultra-high density electrodes improve detection, yield, and cell type specificity
      of brain recordings.
LID - 2023.08.23.554527
AB  - To study the neural basis of behavior, we require methods to sensitively and
      accurately measure neural activity at single neuron and single spike resolution. 
      Extracellular electrophysiology is a principal method for achieving this, but it 
      has biases in the neurons it detects and it imperfectly resolves their action
      potentials. To overcome these limitations, we developed a silicon probe with
      significantly smaller and denser recording sites than previous designs, called
      Neuropixels Ultra (NP Ultra). This device measures neuronal activity at
      ultra-high densities (>1300 sites per mm, 10 times higher than previous probes), 
      with 6 μm center-to-center spacing and low noise. This device effectively
      comprises an implantable voltage-sensing camera that captures a planar image of a
      neuron’s electrical field. We introduce a new spike sorting algorithm optimized
      for these probes and use it to find that the yield of visually-responsive neurons
      in recordings from mouse visual cortex improves ~3-fold. Recordings across
      multiple brain regions and four species revealed a subset of unexpectedly small
      extracellular action potentials not previously reported. Further experiments
      determined that, in visual cortex, these do not correspond to major subclasses of
      interneurons and instead likely reflect recordings from axons. Finally, using
      ground-truth identification of cortical inhibitory cell types with optotagging,
      we found that cell type was discriminable with approximately 75% success among
      three types, a significant improvement over lower-resolution recordings. NP Ultra
      improves spike sorting performance, sampling bias, and cell type classification.

TI  - Chronic exposure to dexamethasone may not affect sugammadex reversal of
      rocuronium-induced neuromuscular blockade: an in vivo study on rats.
PG  - 275-83
AB  - Background: Chronic glucocorticoid exposure is associated with resistance to
      nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents. Therefore, we hypothesized that
      sugammadex-induced recovery would occur more rapidly in subjects exposed to
      chronic dexamethasone compared to those who were not exposed. This study
      evaluated the sugammadex-induced recovery profile after neuromuscular blockade
      (NMB) in rats exposed to chronic dexamethasone. Methods: Sprague–Dawley rats were
      allocated to three groups (dexamethasone, control, and pair-fed group) for the in
      vivo study. The mice received daily intraperitoneal dexamethasone injections (500
      μg/kg) or 0.9% saline for 15 days. To achieve complete NMB, 3.5 mg/kg rocuronium 
      was administered on the sixteenth day. The recovery time to a train-of-four ratio
      ≥ 0.9 was measured to evaluate the complete recovery following the sugammadex
      injection. Results: Among the groups, no significant differences were observed in
      the recovery time to a train-of-four ratio ≥ 0.9 following sugammadex
      administration (P = 0.531). The time to the second twitch of the train-of-four
      recovery following rocuronium administration indicated that the duration of NMB
      was significantly shorter in Group D than that in Groups C and P (P = 0.001).
      Conclusions: Chronic exposure to dexamethasone did not shorten the recovery time 
      of sugammadex-induced NMB reversal. However, the findings of this study indicated
      that no adjustments to sugammadex dosage or route of administration is required, 
      even in patients undergoing long-term steroid treatment.

TI  - Propofol suppresses hormones levels more obviously than sevoflurane in pediatric 
      patients with craniopharyngioma: A prospective randomized controlled clinical
      trial.
LID - e0288863
AB  - Objective: General anesthesia can disturb the hormone levels in surgical
      patients. Hormone deficiency is one of the major symptoms of craniopharyngioma
      (CP) in pediatric patients. The aim of this prospective randomized controlled
      clinical study is to evaluate whether propofol and sevoflurane influence the
      perioperative hormone levels in these patients and to determine which anesthesia 
      technique causes less impact on hormone levels. Materials: Sixty-four ASA I and
      II pediatric patients with CP undergoing elective neurosurgery were randomly
      divided into the sevoflurane group (S group, n = 32) and the propofol group (P
      group, n = 32). Anesthesia was maintained with sevoflurane and propofol until the
      end of the operation. Demographic information, operation information and
      hemodynamic variables were recorded. The levels of hormones were evaluated
      preoperatively as the baseline (T0), 1h after the beginning of the operation
      (T1), immediately at the end of the operation (T2) and 72 h postoperatively (T3).
      Results: There were no significant differences in the two groups in terms of
      patients’ demographics and intraoperative information, such as operation
      duration, blood loss and transfusion volumes, and fluid infusion volume (P>0.05).
      In both groups, compared to those at T0, the levels of TSH, FT3, TT3 and ACTH at 
      T1, T2 and T3 were significantly lower. The levels of FSH, PRL and GH at T3 were 
      also significantly lower (P<0.05). The FT3 and TT3 levels of both groups at T2
      and T3 were significantly lower than those at T1, but the ACTH level was
      significantly increased (P<0.05). Compared to the levels at T2, the TSH, FT3, FT4
      and ACTH levels of the two groups at T3 were significantly reduced (P<0.05). The 
      baseline hormone levels of both groups were similar (P>0.05). At T1, the FT3,
      TT3, FT4, TT4 and ACTH levels in the P group were significantly lower than those 
      in the S group (P<0.05). At T2, the TT3 and ACTH levels of the P group were
      significantly lower than those of the S group (P<0.05) At T3, the TT4 level in
      the P group was significantly lower than that of the S group (P<0.05).
      Conclusion: Propofol and sevoflurane could reduce the levels of hormones
      intraoperatively and postoperatively in pediatric patients with
      craniopharyngioma. However, propofol reduced hormone levels more intensively,
      mainly intraoperatively. Postoperatively, propofol and sevoflurane had similar
      inhibition effects on the shift in hormone levels. Therefore, in pediatric
      patients with craniopharyngioma undergoing neurosurgery, sevoflurane might be the
      preferred anesthetic because it causes less interruption of hormone levels.
      However, because of their similar postoperative effects, which long-term effects 
      of sevoflurane or propofol could produce optimal clinical situations? Thus more
      extensive clinical studies are needed. Trial registration: Clinical trial

      recurrent atrial fibrillation after catheter ablation.
LID - 63
AB  - Background: Many patients would require repeated ablation procedures owing to
      recurrent atrial fibrillation with its associated symptoms. Identifying those who
      are at risk of recurrent AF could assist us to develop preventive strategies and 
      to properly select those who will benefit more from catheter ablation. Our aim is
      to study the role of preprocedural serum level of certain biomarkers in the
      prediction of AF recurrence after catheter ablation. Results: The present study
      included 117 patients: 26 patients with persistent and 91 patients with
      paroxysmal AF. Blood samples for estimation of serum levels of studied cytokines 
      were obtained prior to the procedure. Pulmonary vein isolation was performed in
      all patients through point-by point radiofrequency ablation guided by 3D
      electroanatomical mapping system. Patients were followed for 12 months for AF
      recurrence. Forty-one (35%) patients developed AF recurrence. Those patients were
      significantly older, had significantly higher BMI, lower ejection fraction, and
      wider maximal left atrial diameter (LAD). Serum hs-CRP, IL-6, TNF-α, visfatin,
      and adiponectin levels were significantly higher compared to those who did not
      develop AF recurrence. Correlation analysis showed positive correlations between 
      the incidence of RAF and patients’ age, BMI, and maximum LAD and elevated
      cytokine levels and maximal LAD showed significant correlations with the type of 
      AF and elevated serum TNF-α, visfatin, and adiponectin. Statistical analyses
      defined elevated serum levels of TNF-α, visfatin, and adiponectin as positive
      predictors for RAF, and automatic linear modeling analysis showed that elevated
      serum visfatin, TNF-α, and adiponectin can predict RAF by accuracy rates of 50%, 
      34%, and 16%, respectively. Conclusions: RAF is most probably an outcome of the
      interplay between patients' clinical data, obesity, and inflammation.
      Pre-procedural estimation of serum levels of visfatin and TNF-α might determine
      patients with probability for RAF.

TI  - Pulmonary vein isolation for atrial fibrillation using true high-power
      short-duration vs. cryoballoon ablation.
PG  - 846-52
AB  - Aims: Pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) is achievable and effective using
      radiofrequency (RF) catheter (CA) or cryoballoon (CB) ablation. The newly
      introduced high RF-power short-duration ablation (HPSD) technique has shown
      promising results. Data comparing HPSD- to CB-PVI is sparse. We sought to
      investigate success rates and procedural differences of HPSD-PVI vs. CB-PVI in
      patients undergoing ablation for PAF and persAF. Methods: Consecutive patients
      undergoing de novo PVI (HPSD or CB) were included. A power setting of 70W/7 s
      (70W/5 s at posterior wall) using a flexible tip catheter with enhanced
      irrigation was considered as true HPSD. Follow-up consisted of out-clinic pts
      visits, tele-consultation, 48-h Holter ECG, app-based telemonitoring and cardiac 
      implanted electronic devices (CIED) interrogation. Results: 721 patients (46
      HPSD, 675 CB) were analyzed. In all HPSD (27 persAF [59%]) and CB patients (423
      persAF [63%]), PVI was successfully achieved. Procedure duration was
      significantly longer for HPSD (91 ± 19 min vs. 72 ± 18 min, p < 0.01). Ablation
      time was similar in both groups (HPSD: 44 ± 19 min vs. CB: 40 ± 17 min;
      p = 0.347). No major complications occurred in HPSD. For CB-PVI, in 25 (3.7%;
      p = 0.296) patients, complications occurred. At a follow-up of 290 ± 135 days,
      arrhythmia-free survival using HPSD was non-inferior to CB-PVI in the
      Kaplan–Meier survival analysis (p = 0.096). Conclusion: PVI using HPSD is equally
      effective and safe to CB-PVI. This analysis revealed a similar arrhythmia-free
      survival after HPSD and CB with low complication rates. Procedure duration for CB
      was significantly shorter while LA dwell time excluding mapping was equal.
      Currently, a prospective trial is conducted to corroborate these findings.

TI  - How to Perform a Completely Fluoroless Ablation.
PG  - 5455-64
AB  - Radiation exposure related to electrophysiology catheter ablation procedures
      carries small but non-negligible stochastic and deterministic effects on health. 
      Lead aprons can also place considerable pressure on the spinal column, resulting 
      in potentially detrimental consequences. Fortunately, however, advancements in
      tools used for arrhythmia mapping and ablation have made it feasible to reduce or
      essentially eliminate the need for fluoroscopy, with no impact on the efficacy or
      safety of such procedures, as demonstrated by several long-term outcome studies. 
      In this review, we describe our stepwise approach to safely and efficiently
      perform a completely fluoroless ablation.

TI  - Temperature management during cytoreductive surgery with hyperthermic
      intraperitoneal chemotherapy.
LID - 1062158
AB  - In addition to attaining complete or near complete cytoreduction, the
      instillation of select heated chemotherapeutic agents into the abdominal cavity
      has offered a chance for cure or longer survival inpatients with peritoneal
      surface malignancies. While the heating of chemotherapeutic agents enhances
      cytotoxicity, the resulting systemic hyperthermia has been associated with an
      increased risk of severe hyperthermia and its associated complications. Factors
      that have been associated with an increased risk of severe hyperthermia include
      intraoperative blood transfusions and longer perfusion duration. However, the
      development of severe hyperthermia still remains largely unpredictable. Thus, at 
      several institutions, cooling protocols are employed during cytoreductive surgery
      with hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (CRS-HIPEC). Cooling protocols for
      CRS-HIPEC are not standardized and may be associated with episodes of severe
      hyperthermia or alternatively hypothermia. In theory, excessive cooling could
      result in a decreased effectiveness of the intraperitoneal chemotherapeutic
      agents. This presumption has been supported by a recent study of 214 adults
      undergoing CRS-HIPEC, where failure to attain a temperature of 38° C at the end
      of chemo-perfusion was associated with worse survival. Although not statistically
      significant, failure to maintain a temperature of 38° C for at least 30 minutes
      was associated with worse survival. Although studies are limited in this regard, 
      the importance of maintaining a steady state of temperature during the
      hyperthermic phase of intraperitoneal chemotherapy administration cannot be
      disregarded. The following article describes the processes and physiological
      mechanisms responsible for hyperthermia during CRS-HIPEC. The challenges
      associated with temperature management during CRS-HIPEC and methods to avoid
      severe hypothermia and hyperthermia are also described.

TI  - Procedural time reduction associated with active esophageal cooling during
      pulmonary vein isolation.
PG  - 617-23
AB  - Background: Active esophageal cooling is increasingly utilized as an alternative 
      to luminal esophageal temperature (LET) monitoring for protection against thermal
      injury during pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) when treating atrial fibrillation
      (AF). Published data demonstrate the efficacy of active cooling in reducing
      thermal injury, but impacts on procedural efficiency are not as well
      characterized. LET monitoring compels pauses in ablation due to heat stacking and
      temperature overheating alarms that in turn delay progress of the PVI procedure, 
      whereas active esophageal cooling allows avoidance of this phenomenon. Our
      objective was to measure the change in PVI procedure duration after
      implementation of active esophageal cooling as a protective measure against
      esophageal injury. Methods: We performed a retrospective review under IRB
      approval of patients with AF undergoing PVI between January 2018 and February
      2020. For each patient, we recorded age, gender, and total procedure time. We
      then compared procedure times before and after the implementation of active
      esophageal cooling as a replacement for LET monitoring. Results: A total of 373
      patients received PVI over the study period. LET monitoring using a multi-sensor 
      probe was performed in 198 patients, and active esophageal cooling using a
      dedicated device was performed in 175 patients. Patient characteristics did not
      significantly differ between groups (mean age of 67 years, and gender 37.4%
      female). Mean procedure time was 146 ± 51 min in the LET-monitored patients, and 
      110 ± 39 min in the actively cooled patients, representing a reduction of 36 min,
      or 24.7% of total procedure time (p < .001). Median procedure time was 141 [IQR
      104 to 174] min in the LET-monitored patients and 100 [IQR 84 to 122] min in the 
      actively cooled patients, for a reduction of 41 min, or 29.1% of total procedure 
      time (p < .001). Conclusions: Implementation of active esophageal cooling for
      protection against esophageal injury during PVI was associated with a
      significantly large reduction in procedure duration.

TI  - High-power short-duration ablation index–guided pulmonary vein isolation protocol
      using a single catheter.
PG  - 633-42
AB  - Background: Catheter ablation for atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most commonly
      performed electrophysiological procedure. To improve healthcare utilization, we
      aimed to compare the efficacy, efficiency, and safety of a minimalistic,
      streamlined single catheter ablation approach using a high-power short-duration
      ablation index–guided protocol (HPSD) vs. a control single-catheter protocol
      (SP). Methods: Pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) with a single transseptal puncture 
      without a multipolar mapping catheter was performed in 91 patients. Left atrial
      mapping was performed with the ablation catheter, only. Pacing maneuvers were
      used to confirm exit block. Procedural characteristics and success rates were
      compared using HPSD (n = 34) vs. a control (n = 57) ablation protocol. Freedom
      from recurrence was defined as a 1-year absence of AF episodes > 30 s, beyond the
      3-month blanking period. Results: Using the HPSD protocol the median procedure
      and RF ablation time were significantly shorter compared to the SP, 84 (IQR
      76–100) vs. 118 min (IQR 104–141) and 1036 (898–1184) vs. 1949s (IQR 1693–2261), 
      respectively, p < .001 for all. First-pass PVI was achieved using the HPSD
      protocol in 88% and using the SP in 87% of patients, p = 1.0. No procedural
      complications were observed. High-sensitivity cardiac troponin levels were
      significantly higher in patients using the HPSD protocol compared to the SP. At
      12 months follow-up, 87% patients remained free from AF with no differences
      between groups. Conclusions: A minimalistic, HPSD ablation index–guided PVI with 
      a single-catheter approach is very efficient, safe, and associated with excellent
      clinical outcomes at 1 year. Supplementary Information: The online version

TI  - Is there an association between left atrial outpouching structures and recurrence
      of atrial fibrillation after catheter ablation?
LID - e0276369
AB  - Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of left atrial
      diverticula (LADs), left sided septal pouches (LSSPs) and middle right pulmonary 
      veins (MRPVs) on recurrent atrial fibrillation (rAF) in patients undergoing laser
      pulmonary vein isolation procedure (PVI). Material and methods: This
      retrospective study enrolled 139 patients with pre-procedural multiple detector
      computed tomography (MDCT) imaging and 12 months follow-up examination. LADs,
      LSSPs and MRPV were identified by two radiologists on a dedicated workstation
      using multiplanar reconstructions and volume rendering technique. Univariate and 
      bivariate regression analyses with patient demographics and cardiovascular risk
      factors as covariates were performed to reveal independent factors associated
      with rAF. Results: LADs were recorded in 41 patients (29%), LSSPs in 20 (14%) and
      MRPVs in 15 (11%). The right anterosuperior wall of the left atrium was the most 
      prevalent location of LADs (68%). rAF occured in 20 patients, thereof, 15
      exhibited an outpouching structure of the left atrium (LAD: 9, LSSP: 2 and MRPV: 
      3). Presence of an LAD (HR: 2.7, 95%CI: 1.0–8.4, p = 0.04) and permanent AF (HR: 
      4.8, 95%CI: 1.5–16.3, p = 0.01) were independently associated with rAF.
      Conclusions: LAD, LSSP and MRPV were common findings on pre-procedural cardiac
      computed tomography. LADs were revealed as potential independent risk factor of
      rAF, which might be considered for treatment planning and post-treatment
      observation.

TI  - Dysphagia as a Postoperative Complication of Anterior Cervical Discectomy and
      Fusion.
LID - e26888
AB  - Anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF), despite its possible
      complications, remains the gold standard for the surgical treatment of patients
      with radiculopathy and/or myelopathy caused by cervical intervertebral disc
      herniation or spondylosis. Despite its high rate of incidence, postoperative
      dysphagia following ACDF is still poorly understood; its pathogenesis remains
      relatively unknown, and its risk factors are still a subject of debate.The aim of
      this study is to review the incidence, pathogenesis, diagnosis, and methods of
      prevention of dysphagia in ACDF patients. To this end, a literature review was
      conducted based on the PubMed internet database. Article titles were searched by 
      using the following keywords: “dysphagia” and “anterior cervical discectomy and
      fusion” or “ACDF”. The search was limited to prospective clinical studies
      evaluating dysphagia after ACDF surgery. Studies published in non-English
      languages, retrospective studies, cadaveric studies, reviews, case reports, study
      protocols, and commentary studies were excluded.Initially, 335 studies were
      identified after a primary search. After the application of the exclusion
      criteria, 73 studies remained for the final analysis. This literature review
      focused on identifying the rate of dysphagia and the various risk factors leading
      to this complication by comparing and evaluating the current literature with a
      wide spectrum of heterogeneity concerning patients, surgeons, and surgical
      techniques. A mean dysphagia rate of 19.4% (95% CI: 9.6%-29.1%) based on the
      findings of the included studies correlating dysphagia directly with ACDF
      procedures was calculated. Various established risk factors leading to dysphagia 
      include the female sex, smoking, the surgical approach, rhBMP-2 use, and
      multilevel surgery, while zero-profile devices seem to reduce dysphagia risk. The
      diagnosis is based on clinical and radiological findings, especially prevertebral
      soft-tissue swelling. However, videofluoroscopic and endoscopic studies have been
      recently used for the evaluation of dysphagia. The role of local administration
      of steroids in the prevention of dysphagia has not yet been clarified. This
      review underscores the prevailing rudimentary understanding of the problem of
      dysphagia after ACDF procedures and highlights the need for more sensitive,
      factor-specific studies for understanding the impact of various risk factors on
      the incidence rate of dysphagia.

TI  - A comparison of clinical outcomes and cost of radiofrequency catheter ablation
      for atrial fibrillation with monitored anesthesia care versus general anesthesia.
PG  - 1714-22
AB  - Introduction: Monitored anesthesia care (MAC) or general anesthesia (GA) can be
      used during catheter ablation (CA) of atrial fibrillation (AF). However, each
      approach may have advantages and disadvantages with variability in operator
      preferences. The optimal approach has not been well established. The purpose of
      this study was to compare procedural efficacy, safety, clinical outcomes, and
      cost of CA for AF performed with MAC versus GA. Methods: The study population
      consisted of 810 consecutive patients (mean age: 63 ± 10 years, paroxysmal AF:
      48%) who underwent a first CA for AF. All patients completed a preprocedural
      evaluation by the anesthesiologists. Among the 810 patients, MAC was used in 534 
      (66%) and GA in 276 (34%). Ten patients (1.5%) had to convert to GA during the
      CA. Results: Although the total anesthesia care was longer with GA particularly
      in patients with persistent AF, CA was shorter by 5 min with GA than MAC
      (p < 0.01). Prevalence of perioperative complications was similar between the two
      groups (4% vs. 4%, p = 0.89). There was no atrioesophageal fistula with either
      approach. GA was associated with a small, ~7% increase in total charges due to
      longer anesthesia care. During 43 ± 17 months of follow‐up after a single
      ablation procedure, 271/534 patients (51%) in the MAC and 129/276 (47%) patients 
      in the GA groups were in sinus rhythm without concomitant antiarrhythmic drug
      therapy (p = 0.28). Conclusion: With the participation of an anesthesiologist,
      and proper preoperative assessment, CA of AF using GA or MAC has similar efficacy
      and safety.

TI  - Optimal Lesion Size Index for Pulmonary Vein Isolation in High-Power
      Radiofrequency Catheter Ablation of Atrial Fibrillation.
LID - 869254
AB  - Background: Although both high-power (HP) ablation and lesion size index (LSI)
      are novel approaches to make effective lesions during pulmonary vein isolation
      (PVI) for atrial fibrillation (AF), the optimal LSI in HP ablation for PVI is
      still unclear. Our study sought to explore the association between LSI and acute 
      conduction gap formation and investigate the optimal LSI in HP ablation for PVI. 
      Methods: A total of 105 consecutive patients with AF who underwent HP ablation
      guided by LSI (LSI-guided HP) for PVI in our institute between June 2019 and July
      2020 were retrospectively enrolled. Each ipsilateral PV circle was subdivided
      into four segments, and ablation power was set to 50 W with target LSI values at 
      5.0 and 4.0 for anterior and posterior walls, respectively. We compared the LSI
      values with and without acute conduction gaps after the initial first-pass PVI.
      Results: PVI was achieved in all patients, and the incidence of first-pass PVI
      was 78.1% (82/105). A total of 6,842 lesion sites were analyzed, and the acute
      conduction gaps were observed in 23 patients (21.9%) with 45 (0.7%) lesion
      points. The gap formation was significantly associated with lower LSI (3.9 ± 0.4 
      vs. 4.6 ± 0.4, p < 0.001), lower force-time integral (82.6 ± 24.6 vs. 120.9 ±
      40.4 gs, p < 0.001), lower mean contact force (5.7 ± 2.4 vs. 8.5 ± 2.8 g, p <
      0.001), shorter ablation duration (10.5 ± 3.6 vs. 15.4 ± 6.4 s, p < 0.001), lower
      mean temperature (34.4 ± 1.4 vs. 35.6 ± 2.6°C, p < 0.001), and longer interlesion
      distance (4.4 ± 0.3 vs. 4.3 ± 0.4 mm, p = 0.031). As per the receiver operating
      characteristic analysis, the LSI had the highest predictive value for gap
      formation in all PVs segments, with a cutoff of 4.35 for effective ablation
      (sensitivity 80.0%; specificity 75.4%, areas under the curve: 0.87). The LSI of
      4.55 and 3.95 had the highest predictive value for gap formation for the anterior
      and posterior segments of PVs, respectively. Conclusion: Using LSI-guided HP
      ablation for PVI, more than 4.35 of LSI for all PVs segments showed the best
      predictive value to avoid gap formation for achieving effective first-pass PVI.
      The LSI of 4.55 for the anterior wall and 3.95 for the posterior wall were the
      best cutoff values for predicting gap formation, respectively.

TI  - Effect of air removal with extracorporeal balloon inflation on incidence of
      asymptomatic cerebral embolism during cryoballoon ablation of atrial
      fibrillation: A prospective randomized study.
LID - 101020
AB  - Background: It was previously reported, based on a retrospective study, that
      preliminary removal of air bubbles in heparinized saline water with
      extracorporeal balloon inflation reduced the incidence of asymptomatic cerebral
      embolism (ACE). The present study aims to compare the incidence of ACE between a 
      conventional and pre-inflation method during cryoballoon ablation in a
      prospective randomized controlled study. Methods: A total of 98 atrial
      fibrillation patients were enrolled and randomized into conventional and
      pre-inflation groups. Patients in the pre-inflation group received balloon
      massaging with preliminary extracorporeal balloon inflation in saline water
      before the cryoballoon was inserted into the body. Results: The baseline
      characteristics were similar between the two groups. Post-procedural 3-Tesla MRI 
      revealed CE in 27.6% of patients. Symptomatic CE only occurred in two patients in
      the pre-inflation group. One patient had transient dysarthria and mild muscle
      weakness in one hand; the other patient complained of transient left upper limb
      weakness, left lower limb paresthesia and dysarthria. The incidence of ACE
      detected by cerebral MRI did not differ between the two groups to a statistically
      significant extent (conventional vs. pre-inflation; 22.9% vs. 29.2%; P = 0.49).
      In the multivariable analysis, eGFR was independently associated with the
      presence of ACE (odds ratio 0.95; 95% confidence interval 0.907–0.995; P = 0.03).
      Conclusion: In this prospective randomized study, the preliminary removal of air 
      bubbles in heparinized saline water with extracorporeal balloon inflation had no 
      impact on the incidence of ACE.

      Insights from Ablation Index data in the IMPACT trial and clinical outcomes.
PG  - 2546-57
AB  - Introduction: The IMPACT study established the role of controlled esophageal
      cooling in preventing esophageal thermal injury during radiofrequency (RF)
      ablation for atrial fibrillation (AF). The effect of esophageal cooling on
      ablation lesion delivery and procedural and patient outcomes had not been
      previously studied. The objective was to determine the effect of esophageal
      cooling on the formation of RF lesions, the ability to achieve procedural
      endpoints, and clinical outcomes. Methods: Participants in the IMPACT trial
      underwent AF ablation guided by Ablation Index (30 W at 350–400 AI posteriorly,
      40 W at ≥450 AI anteriorly). A blinded 1:1 randomization assigned patients to the
      use of the ensoETM® device to keep esophageal temperature at 4°C during ablation 
      or standard practice using a single‐sensor temperature probe. Ablation parameters
      and clinical outcomes were analyzed. Results: Procedural data from 188 patients
      were analyzed. Procedure and fluoroscopy times were similar, and all pulmonary
      veins were isolated. First‐pass pulmonary vein isolation and reconnection at the 
      end of the waiting period were similar in both randomized groups (51/64 vs.
      51/68; p = 0.54 and 5/64 vs. 7/68; p = 0.76, respectively). Posterior wall
      isolation was also similar: 24/33 versus 27/38; p = 0.88. Ablation effect on
      tissue, measured in impedance drop, was no different between the two randomized
      groups: 8.6Ω (IQR: 6–11.8) versus 8.76Ω (IQR: 6–12.2; p = 0.25). Arrhythmia
      recurrence was similar after 12 months (21.1% vs. 24.1%; 95% CI: 0.38–1.84; HR:
      0.83; p = 0.66). Conclusions: Esophageal cooling has been shown to be effective
      in reducing ablation‐related thermal injury during RF ablation. This protection
      does not compromise standard procedural endpoints or clinical success at 12
      months.

TI  - Intra-abdominal hypertension during hip arthroscopy: a case report.
PG  - 102-5
AB  - Symptomatic extravasation of irrigation fluid is a rare complication of hip
      arthroscopy. However, depending on the amount of fluid, intra-abdominal
      hypertension (IAH) may occur and even develop into abdominal compartment
      syndrome, which can seriously alter hemodynamic circulation. Therefore, it is
      important for anesthesiologists to promptly recognize the abnormal signs of IAH
      for early diagnosis and better clinical outcomes. Nevertheless, these signs are
      difficult to detect because they are usually obscured when the patient is under
      anesthesia and masked by surgical drapes. We report a case of IAH under general
      anesthesia during hip arthroscopy to highlight possible symptoms and signs.

TI  - Targeted Temperature Management in Postresuscitation Care After Incorporating
      Results of the TTM2 Trial.
LID - e026539
AB  - Cardiac arrest still accounts for a substantial proportion of cardiovascular
      related deaths and is associated with a tremendous risk of neurological injury
      and, among the few survivors, poor quality of life. Critical determinants of
      survival and long‐term functional status after cardiac arrest are timely
      initiation of cardiopulmonary resuscitation and use of an external defibrillator 
      for patients with a shockable rhythm. Outcomes are still far from satisfactory,
      despite ongoing efforts to improve cardiac arrest response systems, as well as
      elaborate postresuscitation algorithms. Targeted temperature management at the
      wide range between 32 °C and 36 °C has been one of the main therapeutic
      strategies to improve neurological outcome in postresuscitation care. This
      recommendation has been mainly based on 2 small randomized trials that were
      published 20 years ago. Most recent data derived from the TTM2 (Targeted
      Hypothermia Versus Targeted Normothermia After Out‐of‐Hospital Cardiac Arrest)
      trial, which included 1861 patients, challenge this strategy. It showed no
      benefit of targeted hypothermia at 33 °C over normothermia at 36 °C to 37.5 °C
      with fever prevention. Because temperature management at lower temperatures also 
      correlated with an increased risk of side effects without any benefit in the TTM2
      trial, a modification of the guidelines with harmonizing temperature management
      to normothermia might be necessary.

TI  - Comparison between weight-adjusted, high-frequency, low-tidal-volume ventilation 
      and atrial pacing with normal ventilation in high-power, short-duration atrial
      fibrillation ablation: Results of a pilot study.
PG  - 483-90
AB  - Background: Better contact force (CF) and catheter stability (CS) during atrial
      fibrillation (AF) ablation are associated with higher success rate. Changes in CF
      and CS are observed during respiratory movements and cardiac contraction.
      Previous studies have suggested that rapid atrial pacing (RAP) and
      high-frequency, low-tidal-volume ventilation (HFLTV) independently or in
      combination improve CS and CF and quality of lesions. Data from a body
      weight–adjusted HFLTV strategy associated with RAP in AF high-power,
      short-duration (HPSD) ablation are still lacking. Objective: This study aimed to 
      compare the results of HPSD AF ablation using simultaneous weight-adjusted HFLTV 
      and RAP and standard ventilation (SV) protocol. Methods: This was a prospective, 
      nonrandomized study with 136 patients undergoing de novo ablation were divided
      into 2 groups: 70 in RAP (100 ppm) + HFLTV with 4 mL/kg of tidal volume and 25
      breaths/min (group A) and 66 patients with SV in intrinsic sinus rhythm (group
      B). The ablation used 50 W, CF of 5 to 10 g and 10 to 20 g, and 40 mL/min flow
      rate on the posterior and anterior left atrial walls, respectively. Results:
      There were no procedure-related complications. In group A, left atrial and total 
      ablation times were 53.5 ± 8.3 minutes and 67.4 ± 10.1 minutes, respectively.
      Radiofrequency time was 19.7 ± 5.7 minutes, radioscopy time was 3.4 ± 1.8
      minutes, 62 (88.6%) patients had first-pass isolation, 23 (33.3%) patients had
      elevation of luminal esophageal temperature, and 7 (10%) patients had recurrence.
      In group B, left atrial time was 56.7 ± 10.8 minutes, total ablation time was
      72.4 ± 11.5 minutes, radiofrequency time was 22.4 ± 6.2 minutes, radioscopy time 
      was 3.6 ± 3 minutes, 58 (87.9%) patients had first-pass isolation, and 20 (30.3%)
      patients had luminal esophageal temperature elevation. Conclusion:
      Weight-adjusted HFLTV with RAP in comparison with SV and intrinsic sinus rhythm
      in HPSD ablation is safe with no CO2 retention. The approach produced
      significantly reduced radiofrequency, left atrial, and total ablation times and
      better CF and local impedance drop indexes.

      (AF) ablation in persistent AF (persAF), and cryoballoon PVI emerged as an
      initial ablation strategy. Symptomatic atrial arrhythmia recurrence following
      successful PVI in persAF is observed more frequently than in paroxysmal AF.
      Predictors for arrhythmia recurrence following cryoballoon PVI for persAF are not
      well described, and the role of left atrial appendage (LAA) anatomy is uncertain.
      Methods: Patients with symptomatic persAF and pre-procedural cardiac computed
      tomography angiography (CCTA) images undergoing initial second-generation
      cryoballoon (CBG2) were enrolled. Left atrial (LA), pulmonary vein (PV) and LAA
      anatomical data were assessed. Clinical outcome and predictors for atrial
      arrhythmia recurrence were evaluated by univariate and multivariate regression
      analysis. Results: From May 2012 to September 2016, 488 consecutive persAF
      patients underwent CBG2-PVI. CCTA with sufficient quality for measurements was
      available in 196 (60.4%) patients. Mean age was 65.7 ± 9.5 years. Freedom from
      arrhythmia was 58.2% after a median follow-up of 19 (13; 29) months. No major
      complications occurred. Independent predictors for arrhythmia recurrence were LAA
      volume (HR 1.082; 95% CI, 1.032 to 1.134; p = 0.001) and mitral
      regurgitation ≥ grade 2 (HR, 2.49; 95% CI 1.207 to 5.126; p = 0.013). LA volumes 
      ≥110.35 ml [sensitivity: 0.81, specificity: 0.40, area under the curve
      (AUC) = 0.62] and LAA volumes ≥9.75 ml (sensitivity: 0.56, specificity 0.70,
      AUC = 0.64) were associated with recurrence. LAA-morphology, classified as
      chicken-wing (21.9%), windsock (52.6%), cactus (10.2%) and cauliflower (15.3%),
      did not predict outcome (log-rank, p = 0.832). Conclusion: LAA volume and mitral 
      regurgitation were independent predictors for arrhythmia recurrence following
      cryoballoon ablation in persAF. LA volume was less predictive and correlated with
      LAA volume. LAA morphology did not predict the clinical outcome. To improve
      outcomes in persAF ablation, further studies should focus on treatment strategies
      for persAF patients with large LAA and mitral regurgitation.

TI  - Procedural performance between two cryoballoon systems for ablation of atrial
      fibrillation depends on pulmonary vein anatomy.
PG  - 341-51
AB  - Background: Cryoballoon ablation is a first‐line therapy for atrial fibrillation.
      We compared the efficacy and safety of two ablation systems and addressed the
      influence of pulmonary vein (PV) anatomy on performance and outcome. Methods: We 
      consecutively enrolled 122 patients who were planned for first‐time cryoballoon
      ablation. Patients were assigned 1:1 for ablation with the POLARx or the Arctic
      Front Advance Pro (AFAP) system and followed‐up for 12 months. Procedural
      parameters were recorded during the ablation. Before the procedure, a magnetic
      resonance angiography (MRA) of the PVs was generated and diameter, area, and
      shape of each PV ostium were assessed. We applied an evaluated PV anatomical
      scoring system on our MRA measurement data ranging from 0 (best anatomical
      combination) to 5. Results: Procedures performed with POLARx were associated with
      shorter time to balloon temperature −30°C (p < .001), lower balloon nadir
      temperature (p < .001), and longer thawing time till 0°C (p < .001) in all PVs,
      however, time to isolation was similar. We observed a decreasing performance with
      each increase in the score for the AFAP, whereas the POLARx performed constant
      regardless of the score. At 1 year, AF recurred in 14 of 44 patients treated with
      AFAP (31.8%) and in 10 of 45 patients treated with POLARx (22.2%) (hazard ratio, 
      0.61; 95% CI 0.28 to 1.37; p = .225). There was no significant correlation
      between PV anatomy and clinical outcome. Conclusion: We found significant
      differences in cooling kinetics, especially when anatomical conditions are
      difficult. However, both systems have a comparable outcome and safety profile.

TI  - A Pilot Trial to Compare the Long-Term Efficacy of Pulmonary Vein Isolation with 
      High-Power Short-Duration Radiofrequency Versus Laser Energy with Rapid Ablation 
      Mode.
LID - 98
AB  - Background: Pulmonary vein (PV) reconnection is the major cause of atrial
      fibrillation (AF) recurrence after pulmonary vein isolation (PVI). The
      probability of reconnection is higher if the primary lesion is not sufficiently
      effective, which can be unmasked with an adenosine provocation test (APT).
      High-power short-duration radiofrequency energy (HPSD) guided with ablation index
      (AI) and the third generation of the visually guided laser balloon (VGLB) are new
      methods for PVI. Methods: A total of 70 participants (35 in each group) who
      underwent a PVI with either AI-guided HPSD (50 W; AI 500 for the anterior and 400
      for the posterior wall, respectively) or VGLB ablation were included in this
      observational pilot trial. Twenty minutes after each PVI, an APT was performed.
      The primary endpoint was the event-free survival from AF after three years.
      Results: A total of 137 (100%) PVs in the HPSD arm and 131 PVs (98.5%) in the
      VGLB arm were initially successfully isolated (p = 0.24). The overall procedure
      duration was similar in both arms (155 ± 39 in HPSD vs. 175 ± 58 min in VGLB, p =
      0.191). Fluoroscopy time, left atrial dwelling time and duration from the first
      to the last ablation were longer in the VGLB arm (23 ± 8 vs. 12 ± 3 min, p <
      0.001; 157 (111–185) vs. 134 (104–154) min, p = 0.049; 92(59–108) vs. 72 (43–85) 
      min, p = 0.010). A total of 127 (93%) in the HPSD arm and 126 (95%) PVs in the
      VGLB arm remained isolated after APT (p = 0.34). The primary endpoint was met
      1107 ± 68 days after ablation in 71% vs. 66% in the VGLB and HPSD arms,
      respectively (p = 0.65). Conclusions: HPSD and VGLB did not differ with respect
      to long-term outcome of PVI. A large, randomized study should be conducted to
      compare clinical outcomes with respect to these new ablation techniques.

TI  - Evolving Role of Catheter Ablation for Atrial Fibrillation: Early and Effective
      Rhythm Control.
LID - 6871
AB  - Catheter Ablation (CA) is an effective therapeutic option in treating atrial
      fibrillation (AF). Importantly, recent data show that CA as a rhythm control
      strategy not only significantly reduces AF burden, but also substantially
      improves clinical hard endpoints. Since AF is a progressive disease, the time of 
      Diagnosis-to-Intervention appears crucial. Recent evidence shows that earlier
      rhythm control is associated with a lower risk of adverse cardiovascular outcomes
      in patients with early AF. Particularly, CA as an initial first line rhythm
      control strategy is associated with significant reduction of arrhythmia
      recurrence and rehospitalization in patients with paroxysmal AF. CA is shown to
      significantly lower the risk of progression from paroxysmal AF to persistent AF. 
      When treating persistent AF, the overall clinical success after ablation remains 
      unsatisfactory, however the ablation outcome in patients with “early” persistent 
      AF appears better than those with “late” persistent AF. “Adjunctive” ablation on 
      top of pulmonary vein isolation (PVI), e.g., ablation of atrial low voltage area,
      left atrial posterior wall, vein of Marshall, left atrial appendage, etc., may
      further reduce arrhythmia recurrence in selected patient group. New ablation
      concepts or new ablation technologies have been developing to optimize
      therapeutic effects or safety profile and may ultimately improve the clinical
      outcome.

TI  - Procedural and outcome impact of obesity in cryoballoon versus radiofrequency
      pulmonary vein isolation in atrial fibrillation patients.
PG  - 403-10
AB  - Purpose: Cryoballoon (CB) ablation and radiofrequency (RF) ablation are the most 
      common techniques for pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) in patients with symptomatic
      atrial fibrillation (AF). An increasing number of patients undergoing PVI are
      obese.To address the paucity of data on outcomes of CB- vs. RF-based PVI in
      relation to body mass index (BMI) of AF patients. Methods: All patients
      undergoing de novo PVI between 01/2018 and 08/2019 at University Hospital Cologne
      were included in this retrospective analysis. Patients of each group (CB-PVI vs. 
      RF-PVI) were analyzed based on their BMI. Hereafter, procedural characteristics
      and AF recurrence rate were compared regarding different BMI groups. Results: A
      total of 526 patients (62% male, 65±11 years) underwent successful de novo PVI
      (320 CB and 206 RF). In obese patients, two differences in procedural
      characteristics were noted: A significantly increased contrast medium volume in
      CB group and a lower fluoroscopy dose in RF group: contrast medium: CB 50 [40-80]
      vs. RF 20 [20-30], p<0.001; fluoroscopy dose: CB 392.4 [197.9-995.9] vs. RF 282.5
      [139.8-507.2], p<0.001. The complication rate was equal throughout all BMI
      groups, regardless of CB or RF usage. For obese patients, a trend toward a higher
      AF recurrence rate was revealed after RF-PVI as compared to CB-PVI. In line with 
      previous studies, the overall procedure time was significantly shorter with
      CB-PVI regardless of BMI. Conclusion: For obese patients, CB-PVI is similarly
      safe and effective as RF-PVI. The significantly shorter procedure time for CB-PVI
      may minimize potential obesity-related complications. However, the lower contrast
      medium quantity and fluoroscopy dose in RF-PVI must be considered. AF recurrence 
      rates were comparable between CB-PVI and RF-PVI.

      Index for the Treatment of Atrial Fibrillation.
LID - 5609764
AB  - Background: To investigate the efficacy and safety of ablation index- (AI-)
      guided high-power radiofrequency ablation in the treatment of atrial fibrillation
      (AF). Methods: Outcomes of radiofrequency (RF) applications were compared in a
      swine ventricular endocardial model (n = 10 each for 50 W, 40 W, and 30 W; AI =
      500). And a total of 100 consecutive patients with paroxysmal AF undergoing
      pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) were included. The patients were divided into two 
      groups (n = 50 for each) as follows: control group, treated with conventional
      power (30 W) ablation mode; and study group, treated with high power (40 W)
      radiofrequency ablation mode. All groups were treated with the same AI value
      guided the ablation (target AI = 400/500 on posterior/anterior wall,
      respectively). Acute pulmonary vein (PV) reconnection was assessed post adenosine
      administration 20 minutes after ablation. Subsequently, pathological observation 
      of porcine heart lesions and necrotic tissue was performed. Additionally,
      statistical analyses were carried out on patients' baseline clinical
      characteristics, surgical data, and total RF energy. Results: In swine
      ventricular endocardial RF applications, compared with 40 W and 30 W, the use of 
      50 W was associated with shallower tissue lesion depth (p < 0.001) and greater
      lesion maximum diameter (p < 0.001). Compared with 40 W and 30 W, tissue necrosis
      caused by 50 W was the deepest and largest (p < 0.001). In pulmonary vein
      isolation (PVI), there was no significant difference in baseline data between the
      study group and control group (p > 0.05). In patients with paroxysmal atrial
      fibrillation, the procedure time in the high-power group was significantly
      shortened (p < 0.001). The ablation time was significantly shorter (p < 0.001).
      Compared with control group, RF energy per point and acute pulmonary vein (PV)
      reconnection were lower (p < 0.001), and first-pass PVI was higher (p < 0.01) in 
      study group. There were no significant differences in complications and sinus
      rhythm maintenance at 12 months between the two groups (p > 0.05). Conclusions:
      Compared with conventional (30 W) PVI, AI-guided high-power (40 W) was safe and
      associated with shorter procedure time and reduced acute PV reconnection.

TI  - Ablation index-guided ablation with milder targets for atrial fibrillation:
      Comparison between high power and low power ablation.
LID - 949918
AB  - Background: High power-ablation index (HP-AI)-guided ablation for atrial
      fibrillation (AF) targeting high AIs has been implemented in European countries. 
      However, milder AI targets are widely used in Asia. The safety and efficacy of
      HP-AI-guided ablation compared with those of low-power AI-guided ablation in a
      milder AI-targeting setting are unknown. The goal of this study was to explore
      the efficacy and safety of HP-AI-guided ablation in a milder AI-targeting
      setting. Methods: Patients who underwent pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) for
      AI-guided atrial fibrillation ablation in our center were enrolled and divided
      into 2 groups according to the ablation power used. In the HP-AI group, the
      ablation power was over 45 W, while the low power-AI group was ablated with <35 W
      power. The targeted AIs were 450–500 in the anterior wall and 350–400 in the
      posterior wall. The efficacy outcome was expressed as the single-procedure atrial
      arrhythmia-free survival between 91 days and 1 year. Safety outcomes included
      severe adverse events (SAEs), including symptomatic pulmonary vein (PV) stenosis,
      atrioesophagal fistula, cardiac tamponade, stroke, thromboembolism events,
      myocardial infarction, and major bleeding. Results: A total of 134 patients were 
      enrolled, of whom 74 underwent PVI using HP-AI, while 60 received low power-AI
      ablation. After a mean follow-up time of 7.4 months, 22 (16.4%) patients showed
      arrhythmia recurrence: 5 (6.8%) patients in the HP-AI group and 17 (28.3%)
      patients in the low power-AI group. The HP-AI group showed a significantly higher
      arrhythmia-free survival than the low power-AI group (p = 0.011). Two patients in
      the low power-AI group and 1 patient in the HP-AI group developed an SAE (p =
      NS). Compared with the low power-AI group, the HP-AI group demonstrated a higher 
      PV first-pass isolation rate, shorter ablation time, and fewer patients with
      anatomical leakages and sites of unreached AI. Conclusion: In a milder AI
      setting, HP-AI ablation might result in significantly higher arrhythmia-free
      survival than low power-AI ablation and a similar safety profile.

TI  - Impact of High-Power and Very High-Power Short-Duration Radiofrequency Ablation
      on Procedure Characteristics and First-Pass Isolation During Pulmonary Vein
      Isolation.
LID - 935705
AB  - Introduction: High-power short-duration (HPSD) radiofrequency ablation has been
      proposed to produce rapid and effective lesions for pulmonary vein isolation
      (PVI). We aimed to evaluate the procedural characteristics and the first-pass
      isolation (FPI) rate of HPSD and very high-power short-duration (vHPSD) ablation 
      compared to the low-power long-duration (LPLD) ablation technique. Methods: One
      hundred fifty-six patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) were enrolled and
      assigned to LPLD, HPSD, or vHPSD PVI. The energy setting was 30, 50, and 90 W in 
      the LPLD, HPSD, and vHPSD groups, respectively. In the vHPSD group, 90 W/4 s
      energy delivery was used in the QMODE+ setting. In the other groups, ablation
      index-guided applications were delivered with 30 W (LPLD) or 50 W (HPSD).
      Results: Bilateral PVI was achieved in all cases. Compared to the LPLD group, the
      HPSD and vHPSD groups had shorter procedure time [85 (75–101) min, 79 (65–91)
      min, and 70 (53–83) min], left atrial dwelling time [61 (55–70) min, 53 (41–56)
      min, and 45 (34–52) min], total RF time [1,567 (1,366–1,761) s, 1,398
      (1,021–1,711) s, and 336 (247–386) s], but higher bilateral FPI rate (57, 78, and
      80%) (all p-values < 0.01). The use of HPSD (OR = 2.72, 95% CI 1.15–6.44, p =
      0.023) and vHPSD (OR = 2.90, 95% CI 1.24–6.44, p = 0.014) ablation techniques
      were associated with a higher probability of bilateral FPI. The 9-month
      AF-recurrence rate was lower in case of HPSD and vHPSD compared to LPLD ablation 
      (10, 8, and 36%, p = 0.0001). Moreover, the presence of FPI was associated with a
      lower AF-recurrence rate at 9-month (OR = 0.09, 95% CI 0.04–0.24, p = 0.0001).
      Conclusion: Our prospective, observational cohort study showed that both HPSD and
      vHPSD RF ablation shortens procedure and RF time and results in a higher rate of 
      FPI compared to LPLD ablation. Moreover, the use of HPSD and vHPSD ablation
      increased the acute and mid-term success rate. No safety concerns were raised for
      HPSD or vHPSD ablation in our study.

TI  - Tailored Target Ablation Index Guided Pulmonary Vein Isolation in Treating
      Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation: A Single Center Randomized Study in Asian
      Population (AI-Asian-I).
LID - 937913
AB  - Objective: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of lower ablation indexes (AI)
      guided pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) in treating paroxysmal atrial fibrillation 
      (AF). Methods: Ninety patients with paroxysmal AF scheduled for radiofrequency
      ablation were randomly divided into three groups. The AI targets for PVI were as 
      follows: In group A/B/C, 550/500/450 for roof and anterior wall, and 400/350/300 
      for posterior/inferior wall. The first-pass PVI rate, ablation time,
      complications and recurrence of atrial tachyarrhythmia (ATa) were compared.
      Results: The mean age was 62.5 years (male: 63.0%), mean body mass index (BMI):
      24.35 ± 3.66 kg/m2. The baseline characteristics were comparable. There was no
      significant difference in the first-pass PVI rate among the three groups
      (left-sided-PV: 66.7% vs. 80% vs. 73.3%, P = 0.51; right-sided-PV: 70% vs. 83.3% 
      vs. 73.3%, P = 0.64), also with similar gap rate during the procedural waiting
      time. At 1-year follow-up there was no significant difference in the recurrence
      rate of ATa among the three groups (10% vs. 13.3% vs. 13.3%, P = 1.00). The
      ablation time in the Group C was significantly less than that in the other two
      groups (47.8 min. vs. 47.0 min. vs. 36.6 min, P < 0.001). Higher AI seemed to
      link a non-significant trend toward higher rate of pericardial effusion (group A 
      + B vs. group C:6.7% vs. 0%, P = 0.30), although the rate of overall
      complications was not different among the three groups. Conclusion: This
      randomized study shows that, a relatively lower target AI guided ablation may be 
      similarly effective to achieve PVI with significantly reduced ablation time and
      obtain similar clinical outcome in treating paroxysmal AF in Asian population.

TI  - Alpha-power in electroencephalography as good outcome predictor for
      out-of-hospital cardiac arrest survivors.
LID - 10907
AB  - This study aimed to investigate the utility of quantitative EEG biomarkers for
      predicting good neurologic outcomes in OHCA survivors treated with targeted
      temperature management (TTM) using power spectral density (PSD), event-related
      spectral perturbation (ERSP), and spectral entropy (SE). This observational
      registry-based study was conducted at a tertiary care hospital in Korea using
      data of adult nontraumatic comatose OHCA survivors who underwent standard EEG and
      treated with TTM between 2010 and 2018. Good neurological outcome at 1 month
      (Cerebral Performance Category scores 1 and 2) was the primary outcome. The
      linear mixed model analysis was performed for PSD, ESRP, and SE values of all and
      each frequency band. Thirteen of the 54 comatose OHCA survivors with TTM and EEG 
      were excluded due to poor EEG quality or periodic/rhythmic pattern, and EEG data 
      of 41 patients were used for analysis. The median time to EEG was 21 h, and the
      rate of the good neurologic outcome at 1 month was 52.5%. The good neurologic
      outcome group was significantly younger and showed higher PSD and ERSP and lower 
      SE features for each frequency than the poor outcome group. After age adjustment,
      only the alpha-PSD was significantly higher in the good neurologic outcome group 
      (1.13 ± 1.11 vs. 0.09 ± 0.09, p = 0.031) and had best performance with 0.903 of
      the area under the curve for predicting good neurologic outcome. Alpha-PSD best
      predicts good neurologic outcome in OHCA survivors and is an early biomarker for 
      prognostication. Larger studies are needed to conclusively confirm these
      findings.

      isolation in atrial fibrillation.
PG  - 200-6
AB  - Background: Ablation index (AI)-guided ablation for posterior wall isolation
      (PWI) using high-power, short-duration remains untested. We sought to evaluate
      the acute outcomes of AI-guided 50 W ablation vs. conventional ablation, and
      investigate the differences in relationship between contact force (CF), time and 
      AI in both groups. Methods: Consecutive patients undergoing first-time AI-guided 
      ablation with PWI using either 50 W or 35–40 W ablation were enrolled. Acute
      procedural metrics and individual lesion level ablation data were compared
      between groups. Results: 40 patients (50 W: n = 20, 35–40 W: n = 20) with atrial 
      fibrillation were included. Total procedure time was significantly reduced with
      50 W (120 vs. 143 mins, p = 0.004) and there was a trend toward decreased
      ablation time (22 vs. 28 mins, p = 0.052). First pass and acute success of PWI
      were comparable between the 50 W and 35–40 W groups (10 vs. 8 patients, p = 0.525
      and 20 vs. 19 patients, p = 1.000, respectively). Individual lesion analysis of
      all 959 RF applications (50 W: n = 458, 35–40 W: n = 501) demonstrated that 50 W 
      ablation led to lower ablation time per lesion (10.4 vs. 13.0s, p < 0.001), and
      increased AI (471 vs. 461, p < 0.001) and impedance drop (7.4 vs. 6.9ohms,
      p = 0.007). Excessive ablations (AI>600 for roof line; AI>500 elsewhere) were
      more frequently observed in the 50 W group (9.0% vs. 4.6%, p = 0.007). CF had
      very good discriminative capability for excessive ablation in both groups. At
      50 W, limiting the CF to <10 g reduced the number of excessive ablations on the
      floor line and within the posterior box to 12% and 4%,respectively. Recurrence of
      atrial arrhythmias at 12 months were comparable between the groups. Conclusion:
      AI-guided 50 W RF ablation reduces the ablation time of individual lesions and
      total procedure time without compromising first pass and acute success rates of
      PWI or 12-month outcomes compared to conventional powers.

TI  - Evaluation of linear lesion formation and thermodynamics by dragging ablation
      with the third-generation laser balloon.
PG  - 311-8
AB  - Background: The lesion formation properties of a motorized rotational delivery
      (RAPID) mode, third-generation laser balloon (LB3) ablation compared to
      point-by-point laser ablation in patients with atrial fibrillation remain
      unclear. Objective: The purpose of this study was to assess lesion
      characteristics and thermodynamics in LB3 ablation with a RAPID mode in vitro
      model. Methods: Chicken muscles were cauterized using LB3 in RAPID mode with 13 W
      and 15 W and 50% overlapped point-by-point fashion with 7 W/30 seconds, 8.5 W/20 
      seconds, 10 W/20 seconds, and 12 W/20 seconds. Lesion depth, width, and
      continuity were compared. Lesion continuity was classified by the visible gap
      degree categorized from 1 (perfect) to 3 (poor). Thermodynamics and maximum
      tissue temperatures were assessed under infrared thermographic monitoring.
      Fifteen and 5 lesions were evaluated per ablation protocol for measurement of
      lesion size and continuity and for thermographic assessment, respectively.
      Results: Lesion depth and width were smaller in RAPID mode laser ablation than
      point-by-point laser ablation (P <.001). However, RAPID mode laser ablation
      revealed sufficient mean lesion depth of 5 mm or more. Lesion continuity was 1
      (perfect) in all samples in RAPID mode laser ablation and point-by-point laser
      ablation (P = 1). Infrared thermographic observation demonstrated fast and
      gapless linear lesion formation with thermal stacking in RAPID mode laser
      ablation. Maximum tissue temperature was lower in RAPID mode laser ablation than 
      point-by-point laser ablation (P <.001). Conclusion: RAPID mode LB3 ablation
      could provide fast, gapless, and acceptable lesion formation with thermal
      stacking and moderate tissue temperature rise.

TI  - Cardiac Tomography and Cardiac Magnetic Resonance to Predict the Absence of
      Intracardiac Thrombus in Anticoagulated Patients Undergoing Atrial Fibrillation
      Ablation.
LID - 2101
AB  - Background: Pulmonary veins isolation (PVI) is a standard treatment for recurrent
      atrial fibrillation (AF). Uninterrupted anticoagulation for a minimum of 3 weeks 
      before ablation and exclusion of left atrial (LA) thrombus with transesophageal
      echography (TEE) immediately before or during the procedure minimize
      peri-procedural risk. We aimed to demonstrate the utility of cardiac tomography
      (CT) and cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) to rule out LA thrombus prior to PVI.
      Methods: Patients undergoing PVI for recurrent AF were retrospectively evaluated.
      Only patients that started anticoagulation at least 3 weeks prior to the CT/CMR
      and subsequently uninterrupted until the ablation procedure were selected. An
      intracardiac echo (ICE) catheter was used in all patients to evaluate LA
      thrombus. The results of CT/CMR were compared to ICE imaging. Results: We
      included 272 consecutive patients averaging 54.5 years (71% male; 30% persistent 
      AF). Average CHA2DS2VASC score was 0.9 ± 0.83 and mean LA diameter was 42 ± 5.7
      mm, 111 (41%) patients were on Acenocumarol and 161 (59%) were on direct oral
      anticoagulants. Anticoagulation was started 227 ± 392 days before the CT/CMR, and
      291 ± 416 days before the ablation procedure. CT/CMR diagnosed intracardiac
      thrombus in two cases, both in the LA appendage. A new CT/CMR revealed resolution
      of thrombus after six additional months of uninterrupted anticoagulation. No
      macroscopic thrombus was observed in any patients with ICE (negative predictive
      value of 100%; p < 0.01). Conclusions: CT and MRI are excellent surrogates to TEE
      and ICE to rule out intracardiac thrombus in patients adequately anticoagulated
      prior AF ablation. This is true even for delayed procedures as long as
      anticoagulation is uninterrupted.

LID - e12323
AB  - Objectives: This study examined whether a fan‐attached jacket (FAJ) may mitigate 
      the heat strain in hot or humid environment. Methods: Nine healthy men engaged in
      60‐min sessions on a bicycle ergometer (4 metabolic equivalents [METs] workload) 
      in hot‐dry (40°C and 30% relative humidity) and warm‐humid (30°C and 85% relative
      humidity) environments. Both are equivalent to an approximately 29°C wet‐bulb
      globe temperature. The experiment was repeated—once wearing an ordinal jacket
      (control condition) and once wearing a long‐sleeve FAJ that transfers ambient air
      at a flow rate of 12 L/s (FAJ condition)—in both environments. Results: Increases
      in core temperatures in hot‐dry environment were not statistically different
      between control and FAJ; however, that in the warm‐humid environment were
      significantly different between control and FAJ (0.96 ± 0.10°C and 0.71 ± 0.11°C 
      in rectal temperature, P < .0001; and 0.94 ± 0.09°C and 0.61 ± 0.09°C in
      esophageal temperature, P < .0001). Changes in heart rate were different between 
      control and FAJ in both environments (62 ± 3 bpm and 47 ± 7 bpm, P < .0001 in
      hot‐dry environment; and 61 ± 3 bpm and 46 ± 5 bpm, P < .0001 in the warm‐humid
      environment) and decrease of %weight change was different in hot‐dry environment 
      (1.59 ± 0.12% and 1.25 ± 0.05%, P = .0039), but not in the warm‐humid
      environment. Conclusions: Wearing a FAJ may mitigate heat strain both in hot or
      humid environments.

TI  - Esophageal temperature management during cryoballoon ablation for atrial
      fibrillation.
PG  - 2560-6
AB  - Introduction: Esophageal thermal injury (ETI) is a well‐recognized complication
      of atrial fibrillation (AF) ablation. Previous studies have demonstrated that
      direct esophageal cooling reduces ETI during radiofrequency AF ablation. The
      purpose of this study was to evaluate the use of an esophageal warming device to 
      prevent ETI during cryoballoon ablation (CBA) for AF. Methods: This prospective, 
      double‐blinded study enrolled 42 patients with symptomatic AF undergoing CBA.
      Patients were randomized to the treatment group with esophageal warming (42°C)
      using recirculated water through a multilumen, silicone tube inserted into the
      esophagus (EnsoETM®; Attune Medical) (WRM) or the control group with a luminal
      single‐electrode esophageal temperature monitoring probe (LET). Patients
      underwent upper endoscopy esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) the following day. ETI
      was classified into four grades. Results: Baseline patient characteristics were
      similar between groups. Procedural characteristics including number of freezes,
      total freeze time, early freeze terminations, coldest balloon temperature,
      procedure duration, posterior wall ablation, and proton pump inhibitor and
      transesophageal echocardiogram use before procedure were not different between
      groups. The EGD was completed in 40/42 patients. There was significantly more ETI
      in the WRM group compared to the LET group (n = 8 [38%] vs. n = 1 [5%],
      p = 0.02). All ETI lesions were grade 1 (erythema) or 2 (superficial ulceration).
      Total freeze time in the left inferior pulmonary vein was predictive of ETI (360 
      vs. 300 s, p = 0.03). Conclusion: Use of a luminal heat exchange tube for
      esophageal warming during CBA for AF was paradoxically associated with a higher
      risk of ETI.

TI  - Comparison of maximum-sized visually guided laser balloon and cryoballoon
      ablation.
PG  - 691-8
AB  - Balloon ablation therapy has recently been used for atrial fibrillation (AF)
      ablation. Laser balloons possess the property in which the balloon size can be
      changed. Standard laser balloon ablation (Standard LBA) was followed by
      additional ablation using a maximally extended balloon (Extended LBA) and its
      lesion characteristics were compared to cryoballoon ablation (CBA), another
      balloon technology. From June 2020 to July 2021, patients with paroxysmal AF who 
      underwent an initial pulmonary vein (PV) isolation were enrolled. Sixty-five
      patients with paroxysmal AF were included, 32 in the LBA and 33 in the CBA group.
      To measure the isolated surface area after the ablation procedures, left atrial
      voltage mapping was performed after Standard LBA, Extended LBA, and CBA. The
      baseline patient characteristics did not differ between LBA and CBA. Extended LBA
      could successfully increase the isolated area more than Standard LBA for all four
      PVs. Compared to CBA, the isolated area of both superior PVs was significantly
      greater with Extended LBA (left superior PV: 8.5 ± 2.1 vs 7.3 ± 2.4, p = 0.04,
      right superior PV: 11.4 ± 3.7 vs 8.7 ± 2.7, p < 0.01), and thus the non-isolated 
      posterior wall (PW) was smaller (8.5 ± 3.4 vs 12.4 ± 3.3, p < 0.01).
      Nevertheless, changes in the cardiac injury markers were significantly lower with
      LBA than CBA. There was no significant correlation between the cardiac injury
      level and isolated area in both groups. In conclusion, Extended LBA exhibited a
      significantly greater isolation of both superior PVs and resulted in a smaller
      non-isolated PW, but the cardiac injury markers were significantly suppressed as 
      compared to CBA.

TI  - Characterization of human islet function in a convection‐driven intravascular
      bioartificial pancreas.
LID - e10444
AB  - Clinical islet transplantation for treatment of type 1 diabetes (T1D) is limited 
      by the shortage of pancreas donors and need for lifelong immunosuppressive
      therapy. A convection‐driven intravascular bioartificial pancreas (iBAP) based on
      highly permeable, yet immunologically protective, silicon nanopore membranes
      (SNM) holds promise to sustain islet function without the need for
      immunosuppressants. Here, we investigate short‐term functionality of encapsulated
      human islets in an iBAP prototype. Using the finite element method (FEM), we
      calculated predicted oxygen profiles within islet scaffolds at normalized
      perifusion rates of 14–200 nl/min/IEQ. The modeling showed the need for minimum
      in vitro and in vivo islet perifusion rates of 28 and 100 nl/min/IEQ,
      respectively to support metabolic insulin production requirements in the iBAP. In
      vitro glucose‐stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) profiles revealed a first‐phase
      response time of <15 min and comparable insulin production rates to standard
      perifusion systems (~10 pg/min/IEQ) for perifusion rates of 100–200 nl/min/IEQ.
      An intravenous glucose tolerance test (IVGTT), performed at a perifusion rate of 
      100–170 nl/min/IEQ in a non‐diabetic pig, demonstrated a clinically relevant
      C‐peptide production rate (1.0–2.8 pg/min/IEQ) with a response time of <5 min.

TI  - Clinical outcomes of cryoballoon ablation for pulmonary vein isolation: Impact of
      intraprocedural heart rhythm.
PG  - 807-14
AB  - Background: The current study sought to assess the impact of the intraprocedural 
      heart rhythm (sinus rhythm [SR] vs. atrial fibrillation [AF]) on acute procedural
      characteristics, durability of pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) and long-term
      clinical outcomes of cryoballoon (CB) ablation. Methods: A total of 195 patients 
      with symptomatic paroxysmal (n = 136) or persistent AF (n = 59) underwent
      CB-based PVI. Ablation procedures were either performed in SR (SR group; n = 147)
      or during AF (AF group; n = 48). Persistent AF was more frequent in the AF group 
      than in the SR group (62% vs. 20%). All other patient baseline characteristics
      did not differ between the two groups. Results: The nadir temperature during the 
      CB applications was significantly lower in the AF group than in patients in the
      SR group (−49 [interquartile range, −44; −54]°C vs. −47 [−42; −52]°C, p = 0.002).
      Median procedure and fluoroscopy times as well as the rate of real-time
      recordings were not different between the two groups. Repeat ablation for the
      treatment of atrial arrhythmia recurrence was performed in 60 patients (SR: 44
      [30%] patients; AF: 16 [33%] patients), with a trend towards a lower rate of
      pulmonary vein reconnections in the AF group (p = 0.07). There was no difference 
      in 3-year arrhythmia-free survival (p = 0.8). Conclusions: Cryoballoon-based PVI 
      during AF results in lower nadir balloon temperatures and a trend towards a
      higher durability of PVI as compared to procedures performed in SR. The rate of
      real-time PVI recordings was not affected by the intraprocedural heart rhythm.

TI  - 10-year follow-up of interventional electrophysiology: updated German survey
      during the COVID-19 pandemic.
PG  - 784-94
AB  - Introduction: This study provides an update of survey-based data providing an
      overview of interventional electrophysiology over the last decade. Overall
      infrastructure, procedures, and training opportunities in Germany were assessed. 
      Methods: By analyzing mandatory quality reports, German cardiology centres
      performing electrophysiological studies were identified to repeat a questionnaire
      from 2010 and 2015. Results: A complete questionnaire was returned by 192 centers
      performing about 75% of all ablations in Germany in 2020. In the presence of the 
      COVID-19 pandemic, a total of 76.304 procedures including 68.407 ablations were
      reported representing a 38% increase compared to 2015. The median number of
      ablations increased from 180 in 2010 to 377 in 2020. AF was the most common
      arrhythmia ablated (51 vs. 35% in 2010). PVI with radiofrequency point-by-point
      ablation (64%) and cryo-balloon ablation (34%) were the preferred strategies.
      Less than 50 (75) PVI were performed by 31% (36%) of all centres. Only 25 and 24%
      of participating centres fulfilled EHRA and national requirements for training
      centre accreditation, respectively. There was a high number of EP centres with no
      fellows (38%). The proportion of female fellows in EP increased from 26% in 2010 
      to 33% in 2020. Conclusion: Comparing 2020, 2010 and 2015, an increasing number
      of EP centres and procedures were registered. In 2020, more than every second
      ablation was for therapy of AF. In the presence of an increasing number of
      procedures, training opportunities were still limited, and most centres did not
      fulfill recommended EHRA or national requirements for accreditation. Graphical

AB  - The ruminant alimentary tract and its effects on blood homeostasis complicate
      prolonged terminal studies conducted under general anesthesia in sheep. We
      therefore studied 15 healthy female white alpine sheep that were undergoing
      prolonged anesthesia (> 30 h) for an unrelated terminal study. In the current
      study, all sheep developed a decreased hematocrit and hemoglobin concentration
      after induction of anesthesia, which fell further, along with a significant
      decrease in white blood cell count, over the course of anesthesia. Sheep also
      showed an initial hyponatremia, a persistent hypokalemia, hypocalcemia, and a
      progressive hyperchloremia. A significant drop in blood pH developed over time
      despite normal values of blood lactate and a marked decline in partial pressure
      of carbon dioxide over the course of the experiment. The latter consequently
      reduced the efficacy of mechanical ventilation, as reflected in a reduced oxygen 
      partial pressure. A significant increase in lactate dehydrogenase and creatinine 
      kinase was observed. Arterial blood pressure and heart rate significantly
      decreased over time, but remained within normotensive and normocardic limits.
      Central venous pressure rose significantly over the course of anesthesia. In
      conclusion, prolonged anesthesia in sheep is associated with a wide range of
      complex physiologic changes. An in-depth understanding of all metabolic
      compensatory mechanisms and their underlying cause during prolonged anesthesia is
      necessary for interpreting data from the primary study, with special
      considerations to account for ruminant-specific physiology.
