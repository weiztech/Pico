TI  - “Functional outcomes and MRI-based tendon healing after (antero-) superior
      rotator cuff repair among patients under 50 years: retrospective analysis of
      traumatic versus non-traumatic rotator cuff tears”.
LID - 52
AB  - Background: Rotator cuff tears among patients under 50 years either result from
      an adequate trauma or are considered non-traumatic due to work-related or
      athletic overuse. The impact of these different mechanisms on postoperative
      functional outcomes and tendon healing has not yet been fully understood.
      Therefore, it was the purpose of this study to investigate the influence of
      etiology of (antero-)superior rotator cuff tears on postoperative outcomes and
      the healing rates after arthroscopic rotator cuff repair in a young patient
      population. Methods: Patients under 50 years who underwent arthroscopic rotator
      cuff repair between 2006–2017 for an anterosuperior rotator cuff tear with a
      minimum follow up of 24 months were included in this study. Revision surgeries or
      reconstructive concomitant procedures other than long head of the biceps
      tenodesis were excluded. Patients were divided into two groups according to the
      etiology of their rotator cuff tear (traumatic vs. non-traumatic). Demographic
      and outcome scores including the American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES)
      score, the Constant Score (CS), bilateral strength measurements and postoperative
      tendon integrity evaluated on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were assessed and 
      compared between both groups. Results: The mean follow up for this study was
      55.6 months (24 – 158). Twenty-one patients (50.0%) had a traumatic RCT and 21
      patients (50.0%) had a non-traumatic tear. Outcome scores did not differ
      significantly between groups. Strength measurements of the supraspinatus revealed
      significantly decreased force of the affected side as opposed to the
      contralateral side (p = 0.001), regardless of etiology. Retear rates were similar
      in both groups (37.5% and 33.3%, p = n.s.). Cuff integrity at follow-up was not
      predictive of superior scores or strength. Conclusion: Surgical treatment of
      traumatic and non-traumatic RCT yields good clinical results in patients under
      the age of 50. The etiology of the rotator cuff tear did not significantly affect
      postoperative outcomes or healing rates. About one third of the patients suffered
      from a retear postoperatively, however retears were not predictive of inferior
      outcomes at midterm follow-up. Study design: Level III. Trial registration:
      Retrospectively registered.

TI  - Suture-tape augmentation of anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction: a
      prospective, randomised controlled trial (STACLR).
LID - 224
AB  - Background: Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction aims to restore
      anteroposterior and rotatory stability to the knee following ACL injury. This
      requires the graft to withstand the forces applied during the process of
      ligamentisation and the rehabilitative period. We hypothesise that the use of
      suture tape augmentation of single bundle ACL reconstruction (ACLR) will reduce
      residual knee laxity and improve patient-reported outcomes at 2-year follow-up.
      We will conduct a 1:1 parallel arm single-centre randomised controlled trial
      comparing suture tape augmented ACLR to standard ACLR technique. Methods: The
      study design will be a parallel arm 1:1 allocation ratio randomised controlled
      trial. Sixty-six patients aged 18 and over waitlisted for primary ACLR will be
      randomised. Patients requiring osteotomy and extra-articular tenodesis and who
      have had previous contralateral ACL rupture or repair of meniscal or cartilage
      pathology that modifies the post-operative rehabilitation will be excluded. The
      primary outcome measure will be the side-to-side difference in anterior tibial
      translation (measured on the GNRB arthrometer) at 24 months post-surgery. GNRB
      arthrometer measures will also be taken preoperatively, at 3 months and 12 months
      post-surgery. Secondary outcomes will include patient-reported outcome measures
      (PROMs) collected online, including quality of life, activity and readiness to
      return to sport, complication rates (return to theatre, graft failure and rates
      of sterile effusion), examination findings and return to sport outcomes.
      Participants will be seen preoperatively, at 6 weeks, 3 months, 12 months and 24 
      months post-surgery. Participants and those taking arthrometer measures will be
      blinded to allocation. Discussion: This will be the first randomised trial to
      investigate the effect of suture-tape augmentation of ACLR on either objective or
      subjective outcome measures. The use of suture-tape augmentation in ACLR has been
      associated with promising biomechanical and animal-level studies, exhibiting
      equivalent complication profiles to the standard technique, with initial
      non-comparative clinical studies establishing possible areas of advantage for the
      technique. The successful completion of this trial will allow for an improved
      understanding of the in situ validity of tape augmentation whilst potentially
      providing a further platform for surgical stabilisation of the ACL graft. Trial

TI  - Locking suture repair versus ligament augmentation—a biomechanical study
      regarding the treatment of acute lateral collateral ligament injuries of the
      elbow.
PG  - 857-63
AB  - Background: Lateral collateral ligament (LCL) tears are frequently observed in
      fractures and dislocations of the elbow. Recent biomechanical evidence suggests
      that additional ligament augmentation may improve repair stability. The aim of
      this biomechanical in-vitro study was to compare the resistance of a locking
      suture repair of the LCL with a ligament augmentation technique. Material and
      methods: Eight fresh frozen cadaveric elbows were evaluated for stability against
      varus/posterolateral rotatory forces (3 Nm). A strain gauge (µm/m; negative
      values) was placed at the origin and insertion of the lateral ulnar collateral
      ligament (LUCL) and cyclic loading was performed for 1000 cycles. We analyzed
      three distinct scenarios: (A) native LCL, (B) locking transosseou suture repair
      of the LCL, (C) simple LCL repair with additional ligament augmentation of the
      LUCL. Results: The mean measured strain was − 416.1 µm/m (A), − 618 µm/m (B) and 
      − 288.5 µm/m (C) with the elbow flexion at 90°; the strain was significantly
      higher in scenario B compared to C (p = .01). During the cyclic load (1000) the
      mean measured strain was − 523.1 µm/m (B) and − 226.3 µm/m (C) with the elbow
      flexion at 60°; the strain was significantly higher in scenario B compared to C
      (p = .01). No significant difference between the first and the last cycles was
      observed (p = .09; p = .07). One failure of the LCL repair was observed after
      1000 cycles; none of the ligament augmentations failed. Conclusion: Ligament
      augmentation (C) provides higher resistance compared to the native LCL (A) and to
      the locking suture repair technique (B). Both techniques, however, hold up during
      1000 cycles. While ligament augmentation might enhance the primary stability of
      the repair, future clinical studies have to show whether this increase in
      resistance leads to negative effects like higher rates of posttraumatic elbow
      stiffness. Level of evidence: Basic science study, biomechanics.

TI  - Simultaneous bilateral quadriceps tendon rupture in a healthy young male: a case 
      report.
LID - 85
AB  - Background: Simultaneous bilateral quadriceps tendon rupture is rare,
      particularly in young individuals with no prior medical history. We present the
      case of a young man who presented with bilateral quadriceps tendon rupture. Case 
      presentation: A 27-year-old Japanese man missed a step while descending a flight 
      of stairs, stumbled, and became aware of severe pain in both knees. He had no
      past medical history, but was severely obese, with a body mass index of
      43.7 kg/m2 (height 177 cm, weight 137 kg). Five days after injury, he was
      referred to our hospital for examination and treatment. Bilateral quadriceps
      tendon rupture was diagnosed based on magnetic resonance imaging, and quadriceps 
      tendon repair with suture anchor was performed on both knees 14 days after
      injury. The postoperative rehabilitation protocol was to immobilize both knees in
      extension for 2 weeks, then to gradually proceed with weight-bearing and gait
      training using hinged knee braces. Both knees obtained a range of motion from 0° 
      to 130° without any extension lag by 3 months postoperatively. One year
      postoperatively, tenderness was evident at the suture anchor in the right knee.
      That suture anchor was therefore removed in a second operation, and histological 
      evaluation of the tendon of the right knee revealed no pathological changes. As
      of 19 months after the primary surgery, the patient showed a range of motion from
      0° to 140° in both knees, did not complain of any disability, and had fully
      returned to normal daily activities. Conclusions: We experienced simultaneous
      bilateral quadriceps tendon rupture in a 27-year-old man with no past medical
      history other than obesity. Suture anchor repair was performed for both
      quadriceps tendon ruptures and achieved a favorable postoperative outcome.

TI  - Primary repair of multiligament knee injury with InternalBrace ligament
      augmentation.
LID - e247173
AB  - Multiligament injury of the knee usually occurs as a result of high-energy trauma
      causing tibiofemoral dislocation. These are rare but potentially limb-threatening
      injuries, frequently involving nerve or arterial damage and often leading to
      severe complex instability. Management generally favours surgical reconstruction 
      of the affected ligaments, with controversy regarding optimal treatment. We
      present a severe multiligament knee injury (Schenk classification KD-IV involving
      both cruciate and both collateral ligaments) in a competitive showjumper. A
      combined arthroscopic/open technique of single-stage surgical repair and suture
      augmentation was used, repairing all affected ligaments. The patient made an
      excellent recovery, returning to work after 12 weeks and riding after 22 weeks.
      After 5-year follow-up, she has regained her previous level of competition
      without subsequent injury. Multiligament repair with suture augmentation is a
      viable approach to the management of knee dislocation injuries. We propose that
      this could provide superior outcomes to traditional reconstruction techniques
      using autograft or synthetic reconstruction.

TI  - Internal Joint Stabilization for Recurrent Nontraumatic Elbow Dislocation in a
      Skeletally Immature Patient.
LID - e24.00074
AB  - Case:: A 14-year-old adolescent boy with SCN1B mutation experienced frequent
      seizures and recurrent elbow dislocation, occurring up to 30 times per day.
      Following failed conservative treatment, the decision was made to surgically
      repair the lateral collateral ligament complex and stabilize the elbow with the
      internal joint stabilizer (IJS). At more than 3 years postoperatively, the
      patient has not had a dislocation event and will retain the device for the
      foreseeable future to maintain predictable elbow stability. Conclusion:: Although
      there is scant evidence supporting the use of the IJS in pediatric cases, the
      current case supports its use in pediatric elbow instability.

TI  - Knotless Suture Anchors Display Favorable Elongation but an Inferior Ultimate
      Failure Load Versus Titanium Suture Anchors and All-Suture Anchors: A
      Biomechanical Comparison in a Porcine Model.
LID - 23259671241300520
AB  - Background:: Several types of suture anchors, which differ in their working
      principles, are available for fixation of ligamentous structures in knee surgery.
      How the choice of a suture anchor type influences the biomechanical stability of 
      ligament fixation is largely unknown. Purpose:: To compare the biomechanical
      properties of different suture anchor designs regarding primary stability for
      tendon fixation and repair in medial collateral ligament (MCL) surgery. Study
      Design:: Controlled laboratory study. Methods:: The primary stability of MCL
      fixation was assessed in a porcine model utilizing 1 of 3 suture anchor types: a 
      5.5-mm titanium suture anchor (TSA), a 2.8-mm all-suture anchor (ASA), or a
      5.5-mm polyether ether ketone knotless suture anchor (KLSA). Primary stability
      was assessed using a uniaxial material testing machine. Cyclic loading at 50 N
      and 100 N was applied for 500 cycles each, followed by a load-to-failure test.
      Results:: After 500 cycles at 50 N, the KLSA (2.4 ± 0.3 mm) showed significantly 
      (P < .05) reduced elongation in comparison to the TSA (4.0 ± 0.9 mm) and ASA (3.6
      ± 0.7 mm), and after 500 cycles at 100 N, the KLSA (6.5 ± 1.4 mm) again showed
      significantly (P < .05) reduced elongation in comparison to the TSA (11.0 ± 2.2
      mm) and ASA (12.0 ± 3.6 mm). However, the KLSA (213 ± 27 N) showed a
      significantly (P < .05) inferior ultimate failure load in comparison to the TSA
      (300 ± 20 N) and ASA (348 ± 23 N). In comparison to the TSA (113.0 ± 11.0 N/mm)
      and ASA (113.6 ± 14.4 N/mm), the KLSA (150.7 ± 11.6 N/mm) displayed the highest
      stiffness (P < .05). No significant differences were observed regarding yield
      load. Conclusion:: KLSAs displayed significantly reduced elongation, at the cost 
      of a reduced ultimate failure load, in comparison to TSAs and ASAs. Clinical
      Relevance:: Surgeons should be aware that differences exist between different
      suture anchor types regarding their biomechanical stability. KLSAs may be
      favorable for fixation of peripheral ligaments in knee surgery.

TI  - Favorable Patient-Reported, Clinical, and Functional Outcomes 2 Years After ACL
      Repair and InternalBrace Augmentation Compared With ACL Reconstruction and
      Healthy Controls.
PG  - 3131-41
AB  - Background:: Recently, interest in anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) preservation 
      and repair after proximal ACL tears has been resurrected. Although good clinical 
      outcomes have been reported in the literature with adequate patient selection, to
      date detailed scientific evidence for the functional benefit of primary ACL
      repair with ligament augmentation is scarce. Purpose:: To compare
      patient-reported, clinical, and functional outcomes in patients 2 years after ACL
      repair and InternalBrace augmentation (ACL-IB) with age- and sex-matched patients
      2 years after ACL reconstruction (ACL-R) and with matched healthy controls. Study
      Design:: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3. Methods:: In total, 29 patients 2
      years after ACL-IB, 27 sex- and age- matched patients 2 years after ACL-R
      (hamstring autografts), and 29 matched healthy controls were included.
      Patient-reported outcomes were assessed using the International Knee
      Documentation Committee score, Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score,
      EQ-5D-5L, Tegner Activity Scale, and Anterior Cruciate Ligament Return to Sports 
      after Injury scale. Surgery time was recorded. For clinical outcomes, range of
      motion and thigh and shank circumference were measured, and passive anterior
      translation was determined using the Rolimeter. Isokinetic muscle strength was
      measured using a Biodex dynamometer. The limb symmetry index
      (operated/contralateral or nondominant/dominant × 100), side-to-side differences 
      (operated – contralateral, nondominant – dominant), and hamstring-quadriceps
      ratios were calculated for functional parameters. Failure and reoperation rates
      were not compared. Results:: Two years after surgery, patients treated with
      ACL-IB showed good to excellent patient-reported outcomes comparable with those
      of patients after ACL-R. Surgery time, including concomitant surgeries, was
      significantly shorter in the ACL-IB group (mean, 81 minutes) compared with the
      ACL-R group (mean, 97 minutes) (P = .024). Isokinetic muscle strength was
      comparable between patient groups without significant differences in extensor and
      flexor strength or in hamstring-quadriceps ratios. Conclusion:: These results
      suggest that ACL-IB achieves comparable patient-reported, clinical, and
      functional outcomes with ACL-R at 2 years postoperatively and, after careful
      patient selection, should be considered as a valuable early treatment alternative
      for proximal ACL tears. Registration:: NCT04429165 (ClinicalTrials.gov
      identifier).

TI  - A new method of anterior talofibular ligament reconstruction: Arthroscopically
      artificial ligament reconstruction with tensional remnant-repair.
PG  - 317-22
AB  - Purpose: To investigate the clinical effects of arthroscopically artificial
      ligament reconstruction with tensional remnant-repair in patients who are obese, 
      and/or with demand for highly intensive sports, and/or with poor-quality ligament
      remnants. Methods: A retrospective case series study was performed on patients
      treated by arthroscopically anterior talofibular ligament (ATFL) reconstruction
      with tensional remnant repair technique from January 2019 to August 2021. General
      data, including demographics, surgical time, and postoperative adverse events,
      were recorded. The American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society score (AOFAS),
      foot and ankle ability measure (FAAM), visual analog scale (VAS), and anterior
      talar translation were measured preoperatively and at 6 weeks, 3 months, and 2
      years postoperatively. Ultrasonography examination was performed preoperatively
      and 2 years postoperatively to evaluate the ATFL. Data were analyzed using SPSS
      19.0. F test was used to analyze the pre- and postoperative VAS, FAAM, and AOFAS 
      scores. The significance was set at p < 0.05. Results: There were 20 males and 10
      females among the patients with a mean age of (30.71 ± 5.81) years. The average
      surgical time was (40.21 ± 8.59) min. No adverse events were observed after
      surgery. At 2 years postoperatively, the anterior talar translation test showed
      grade 0 laxity in all patients. VAS score significantly decreased from
      preoperatively to 6 weeks, 3 months, and 2 years postoperatively (p < 0.001).
      Improvement of FAAM score and the AOFAS score from preoperatively to 6 weeks, 3
      months, and 2 years postoperatively was statistically significant (p < 0.001). At
      3 months postoperatively, most patients (23/30) could return to their pre-injured
      activities of daily living status. At 2 years postoperatively, all patients were 
      able to return to their pre-injured activities of daily living status, and almost
      every patient (18/19) who expected highly intensive sports returned to sports
      with only 1 obese patient failing to achieve the goal. The ultrasonography
      examination at 2 years postoperatively showed that there was a linear band
      structure of soft tissue on the tension-rich fiber tape image from the fibular to
      the talar attachment sits of ATFL. Conclusion: The novel arthroscopically
      artificial ligament reconstruction with tensional remnant-repair technique for
      ATFL achieved satisfactory clinical outcomes in the short and medium term after
      operation, and allowed early return to pre-injured activities, which could be a
      reliable option for patients with chronic lateral ankle instability.

TI  - Clinical and biomechanical outcomes following patellar tendon repair with suture 
      tape augmentation.
PG  - 3569-76
AB  - Purpose: Patellar tendon ruptures (PTR) occur predominantly in middle-aged
      patients following indirect trauma. The aim of this study was to quantify the
      short-term results using a suture tape augmentation technique for the repair of
      PTR. Methods: All consecutive patients with acute (< 6 weeks) PTR who underwent
      suture tape augmentation between 03/2014 and 11/2019 at a single institution with
      a minimum follow-up of 12 months were retrospectively evaluated. Outcome measures
      included Visual Analog Scale (VAS) for pain, Tegner Activity Scale (TAS) and
      return to sport rates, Lysholm score, International Knee Documentation Committee 
      subjective knee form (IKDC) as well as Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome
      Score (KOOS). Additionally, a standardized clinical examination and an isometric 
      strength evaluation of knee extension and flexion were performed. It was
      hypothesized that high return to sport rates and good functional outcome would be
      observed and that the majority of patients would not present with a severe
      (> 20%) knee extension strength deficit when compared to the contralateral side. 
      Results: A total of 7 patients (mean age 37.0 ± SD 13.5 years; 6 male/1 female)
      were available for final assessment at a median follow-up of 17.0 (25–75% IQR
      16.0–77.0) months. Three injuries occurred during ball sports, two injuries
      occurred during winter sports, and one injury each occurred during a motorcycling
      and skateboarding accident. The average time between trauma and surgery was
      4.7 ± 2.6 days. At follow-up, patients reported little pain (VAS: 0 [0–0.4]).
      Return to sport was possible for all patients 8.9 ± 4.0 months postoperatively at
      a high level (TAS: 7.0 [6.0–7.0]). Five patients (71.4%) returned to the
      preinjury level of play, and 2 (28.6%) did not return to the preinjury level of
      play. Patient-reported outcome measures were moderate to good (Lysholm score:
      80.4 ± 14.5; IKDC: 84.2 ± 10.6; KOOS subscales: pain 95.6 ± 6.0, symptoms 81.1
      [64.9–89.1], activities of daily living 98.5 [94.1–100], sport and recreation
      function 82.9 ± 14.1 and knee-related quality of life 75.9 ± 16.3). All patients 
      were very satisfied (57.1%) or satisfied (42.9%) with the postoperative result.
      No postoperative complications were reported. Strength measurements revealed a
      severe knee extension deficit in 3 patients (42.9%), but no significant deficit
      of isometric knee extension or flexion strength in comparison with the
      contralateral side was observed overall (p > 0.05). Conclusion: Suture tape
      augmentation in acute PTR repair leads to good functional outcome without major
      complications. Although a severe knee extension strength deficit may occur in
      some patients postoperatively, an excellent return to sports rate and high
      patient satisfaction can be expected nonetheless. Level of evidence:
      Retrospective cohort study; III.

TI  - A Novel Surgical Technique for Neglected Volar Dislocation of the Lunate: Cases
      Report and Literature Review.
PG  - 1920-5
AB  - Background: Treatments for chronic perilunate or lunate dislocations are very
      difficult and associated with poor prognoses. There is no established treatment
      method and are still many controversies. Case Presentation: We reported three
      cases of chronic neglected lunate volar dislocation treated with a novel surgical
      technique. All three cases were males with wrist pain and tingling sensation.
      Radiographs confirmed chronic volar dislocation of the lunate. Open reduction was
      performed by combined volar and dorsal approaches. After anatomical reduction,
      scapholunate and lunotriquetral interosseous ligament reconstructions were
      performed with the palmaris longus tendon and synthetic tape. The patients had an
      uneventful postoperative period with satisfactory functional outcomes at the last
      follow‐up. Conclusions: We believe that open reduction and interosseous ligament 
      reconstruction using the autogenous tendon and synthetic tape may be a valuable
      option for treating chronic volar dislocation of the lunate.

TI  - Dorsal Scapholunate Ligament Complex Reconstruction Using Suture Tape-Augmented
      Autologous Free Tendon Graft for Chronic Scapholunate Dissociation.
PG  - 790-9
AB  - Background: The treatment of chronic scapholunate dissociation (SLD) can be
      challenging due to several factors such as poor quality of ligament, malalignment
      of the carpus, limited surgical options, and risk of recurrent instability.
      Various surgical techniques have been developed, but there is ongoing debate
      regarding the optimal surgical technique. This study aimed to report the clinical
      and radiological outcomes after dorsal scapholunate (SL) ligament complex
      reconstruction using suture tape-augmented autologous tendon graft. Methods: The 
      study included patients with Garcia-Elias stage 3–4 chronic SLD, SL advanced
      collapse (SLAC) stage 1, and a follow-up period exceeding 1 year. Pre- and
      postoperative SL gap, SL angle (SLA), radiolunate angle (RLA), and dorsal
      scaphoid translation (DST) were measured, and wrist active range of motion,
      Modified Mayo Wrist Score (MMWS), and visual analog scale (VAS) were evaluated.
      Results: Nine patients were included in this study with a mean follow-up period
      of 17 months (range, 15–31 months). All patients were male, with a mean age of 49
      years (range, 30–62 years). Eight patients were classified as Garcia-Elias stage 
      4, while one was classified as SLAC 1. The median (range) of preoperative,
      immediate postoperative, and final follow-up measurements for SL gap, SLA, RLA,
      and DST were 5.4 mm (4.5–5.9), 2.1 mm (1.8–2.5), and 2.5 mm (2.0–2.8) (p =
      0.008); 76° (69°–88°), 50° (32°–56°), and 54° (50°–64°) (p = 0.008); 22°
      (11.5°–33°), 2.8° (0.5°–3.8°), and 3.8° (2.2°–5.6°) (p = 0.008); and 2.8 mm
      (2.0–3.4), 0.8 mm (0.1–1.2), and 1.0 mm (0.1–2.0) (p = 0.008), respectively.
      Immediately after surgery, all radiological measurements showed significant
      improvement, which persisted up to 15 months postoperatively. The preoperative
      and final follow-up measurements of active flexion, extension, radial deviation, 
      and ulnar deviation of the wrist showed significant improvement. The median
      preoperative and final follow-up values of MMWS were 51.1 (range, 40–60) and 88.3
      (range, 85–95) (p = 0.007), respectively, and those of VAS were 7 (range, 6–8)
      and 2 (range, 1–3) (p = 0.007), respectively. Conclusions: Dorsal SL ligament
      complex reconstruction using suture tape-augmented autologous free tendon graft
      could be regarded as a feasible and straightforward technique for addressing
      irreparable chronic SLD.

TI  - Clinical significance of posterior talofibular ligament injury in chronic lateral
      ankle instability.
PG  - 5021-30
AB  - Purpose: Although arthroscopic repair of the anterior talofibular ligament (ATFL)
      is widely performed, the effect of posterior talofibular ligament (PTFL) injury
      on clinical outcomes remains unclear. This study aimed to evaluate the magnetic
      resonance imaging (MRI) findings of the PTFL in chronic lateral ankle instability
      (CLAI) and determine whether the presence or absence of PTFL injury affected the 
      postoperative outcomes of arthroscopic ATFL repair. Materials and methods: Forty 
      ankles of 35 patients who underwent arthroscopic repair for CLAI were included in
      this study as the experimental group, together with 25 ankles of 24 patients
      without CLAI as the control group. The PTFL thickness (PTFLT) and PTFL
      cross-sectional area (PTFLCSA) were measured using MRI and compared between the
      control and CLAI groups. The clinical outcomes of arthroscopic repair were
      compared between ankles with and without PTFL injuries. Results: The mean PTFLT
      and PTFLCSA values were significantly higher in the CLAI group than in the
      control group. The PTFLT and PTFLCSA in the PTFL injury group were significantly 
      larger than those in the non-injury group in the CLAI group. Postoperatively,
      there were no significant differences in clinical scores and talar tilt angles on
      stress radiographs between ankles with and without PTFL injury; however,
      instability recurrence was frequently observed in ankles with PTFL injury (32.1%)
      compared to the ankles without PTFL injury (16.7%). Poor-quality ATFL remnant,
      ATFL inferior fascicle, and calcaneofibular ligament injuries were frequently
      observed in ankles with PTFL injuries. Conclusions: Our findings indicate that
      PTFL injury is highly associated with CLAI but it does not affect postoperative
      clinical scores. However, postoperative instability recurrence was more often
      observed in ankles with PTFL injuries, given that they frequently have
      poor-quality ATFL remnants and CFL injuries. Evidence level: Level III

TI  - Anatomical Augmentation Using Suture Tape for Acute Syndesmotic Injury in
      Maisonneuve Fracture: A Case Report.
LID - 652
AB  - Ankle syndesmosis is crucial to the integrity of the ankle joint and
      weight-bearing; an injury to this structure can lead to significant disability.
      The treatment methods for distal syndesmosis injuries are controversial. The
      representative treatment methods include transsyndesmotic screw fixation and
      suture-button fixation, and good results with suture tape augmentation have
      recently been reported. However, an augmentation using suture tape is only
      possible when the posterior inferior tibiofibular ligament (PITFL) is intact.
      This study describes the case of an unstable syndesmosis injury, accompanied by
      anterior inferior tibiofibular ligament (AITFL) and PITFL injuries, which were
      treated successfully using suture tape. A 39-year-old male patient sustained
      right ankle damage while skateboarding. His leg and ankle radiographs revealed a 
      widening of the medial clear space, a posterior malleolus fracture, a reduced
      “syndesmosis overlap” compared with the contralateral side, and a proximal fibula
      fracture. The magnetic resonance imaging revealed ruptured deltoid ligaments,
      accompanied by AITFL, PITFL, and interosseous ligament injuries. A diagnosis of a
      Maisonneuve fracture with an unstable syndesmotic injury was made. The patient
      underwent an open syndesmotic joint reduction, along with an AITFL and PITFL
      augmentation. This anatomical reduction was confirmed using intraoperative
      arthroscopy and postoperative computed tomography (CT). An axial CT that was
      performed at the 6-month follow-up exam revealed a similar alignment of the
      syndesmosis between the injured and uninjured sides. There were no surgical
      complications and the patient did not complain of discomfort in his daily life.
      At the 12-month follow-up exam, a good clinical outcome was confirmed. As a
      treatment for unstable syndesmosis injury, ligament augmentation using suture
      tape shows satisfactory clinical outcomes and can be considered as a useful and
      reliable method for anatomical restoration and rapid rehabilitation.

TI  - Internal brace augmentation reconstruction versus standard anterior cruciate
      ligament reconstruction: a randomised controlled clinical trial study protocol.
LID - e065254
AB  - Introduction: Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) rupture is one of the most common 
      knee injuries in sports, and the gold standard for treating ACL rupture is tendon
      graft reconstruction. Internal brace technology is being used nowadays for
      ligament repair; however, more relevant in vivo clinical evidence is required for
      using internal brace technology in ACL reconstruction (ACLR). We conducted a
      randomised controlled trial to investigate the clinical efficacy of internal
      brace technology in ACLR. Methods and analysis: This randomised,
      parallel-controlled trial included patients with ACL rupture who underwent
      inpatient surgery at the Department of Orthopaedics, Xiangya Hospital, Central
      South University. Random number table method was used to assign the participants 
      to either the test or the control group. The test group underwent ACLR using the 
      internal brace technique, whereas the control group underwent standard ACLR.
      Uniform postoperative rehabilitation protocol was used for both the groups.
      Patient-reported outcomes included preoperative baseline and postoperative
      recovery at 1, 3, 6, 12 and 24 months. The primary outcome was International Knee
      Documentation Committee function from baseline (ACL rupture) to 6 months
      postoperatively. Secondary outcomes included (1) other patient outcome reporting 
      metrics, Lysholm knee score, Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score and
      Visual Analog Scale; (2) the use of Kneelax3 knee stabiliser to assess knee
      stability; (3) occurrence of adverse events, such as graft refraction or
      symptomatic instability, postoperative infection and contralateral injury and (4)
      magnetic resonance images at 12 and 24 months after ACLR. Ethics and
      dissemination: This trial was approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of the
      Xiangya Hospital of Central South University on 26 October 2021. Data will be
      published in peer-reviewed journals and presented at national and international
      conferences. Trial registration number: ChiCTR2200057526.

TI  - Seatbelt Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction: A Variant of Internal Brace
      in Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction With an Adjustable Loop.
LID - 102892
AB  - In recent years, there has been a growing interest in primary anterior cruciate
      ligament repair with the help of mechanical reinforcement techniques that employ 
      synthetic grafting. The concept of ligament augmentation with reinforcement
      suture or internal bracing consists of stabilizing the repaired ligament and
      augmenting it with an ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene suture or tape,
      which guarantees greater resistance, safety during healing, and a more
      accelerated rehabilitation. In this work, we propose a variant of anterior
      cruciate ligament augmentation with suture, replacing the suture tape with an
      adjustable-loop reinforcement system, which is connected to the adjustable
      suspension devices for the graft in the femur and the tibia, surrounding the
      graft as a seatbelt.

TI  - Repair of Bilateral Quadriceps Tendon Rupture Using a Modified Knotless Suture
      Anchor and Internal Brace Technique: Surgical Technique and Case Report.
PG  - 2396-401
AB  - Background: Quadriceps tendon rupture (QTR) is a rare clinical condition often
      caused by indirect injury in healthy people. In addition, spontaneous and
      bilateral ruptures can occur in patients with predisposing factors, such as
      endocrine or rheumatic disease. Currently, several QTR repair techniques have
      been proposed; however, no consensus exists about the best repair technique. Case
      Presentations: A 55‐year‐old man with renal failure secondary to
      glomerulonephritis suffered from spontaneous bilateral quadriceps tendon
      ruptures. Based on a knotless suture anchor and internal brace, a novel
      double‐row suture‐bridge configuration surgical approach was used to treat the
      patient. At 11‐month follow‐up, the patient maintained excellent function, with a
      Lysholm score of 91 for both knees. Conclusions: This technique may be an
      effective method for repairing ruptured quadriceps tendons.

TI  - Transosseous suture versus suture anchor fixation for inferior pole fractures of 
      the patella in osteoporotic bone: a biomechanical study.
LID - 270
AB  - Background: The surgical treatment of inferior patellar pole fractures can be a
      challenge, especially in geriatric patients, who are particularly frequently
      affected by osteoporosis. The objective of this biomechanical study was to
      compare the performance of suture anchor and transosseous suture fixation in
      fractures of the inferior patellar pole in context of bone mineral density.
      Methods: Twelve fresh-frozen human cadaveric knees received a transverse
      osteotomy, simulating an AO/OTA 34C1.3 inferior pole fracture of the patella.
      These fractures were fixated with either suture anchors (SA; Corkscrew® FT
      4.5 mm) or transosseous suture (TS; #2 FiberWire®). Cyclic loading tests were
      performed by pulling the quadriceps tendon against gravity from 90° flexion to
      almost full extension (5°) for 1000 cycles. Motion and fracture gap displacement 
      were tracked until failure occurred. Subsequently, loading to failure tests
      followed. Differences between groups were compared using unpaired t-tests, and
      correlations were calculated with Pearson’s correlation coefficient. Results: The
      suture anchor group showed significantly fewer cycles to failure than the
      transosseous suture group (SA: 539.0 ± 465.6 cycles, TS: 1000 ± 0 cycles,
      P = 0.04). Bone mineral density correlated positively with cycles to failure in
      the suture anchor group (Pearson’s r = 0.60, P = 0.02). No differences in
      fracture gap displacement could be proven after 100 cycles (SA: 4.1 ± 2.6 mm, TS:
      6.5 ± 2.6 mm, P = 0.19); 500 cycles (SA: 6.4 ± 6.1 mm, TS: 9.6 ± 3.8 mm,
      P = 0.39); and 1000 cycles (SA: 4.0 ± 0.4 mm, TS: 11.0 ± 4.5 mm, P = 0.08).
      Furthermore, the mean destructive load to failure in the suture anchor group was 
      also significantly lower than in the transosseous suture group (SA:
      422.4 ± 212.2 N, TS: 825.7 ± 189.3 N, P = 0.04). Conclusions: Suture anchors may 
      be a viable alternative to transosseous suture in younger patients for clinical
      advantages, but in osteoporotic bone, the more stable osteosynthesis with
      transosseous suture continues to prove superior. Therefore, trauma surgeons might
      consider the use of transosseous suture in elderly patients, especially in those 
      presenting with low bone mineral density values.

TI  - Outcomes of Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction With Independently
      Tensioned Suture Tape Augmentation at 5-Year Follow-up.
PG  - 3658-64
AB  - Background:: Reconstruction using autograft remains the gold standard surgical
      treatment for anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries. However, up to 10% to
      15% of patients will suffer a graft failure in the future. Cadaveric studies have
      demonstrated that the addition of suture tape augmentation to ACL autograft
      constructs can increase graft strength and reduce elongation under cyclical
      loading. Purpose/Hypothesis:: This study aimed to investigate the clinical
      outcomes and rerupture rates after ACL reconstruction (ACLR) with suture tape
      augmentation. We hypothesized that augmentation with suture tape would lead to
      lower rerupture rates. Study Design:: Case series; Level of evidence, 4.
      Methods:: Patients undergoing primary ACLR using hamstring or patellar tendon
      autografts augmented with suture tape between 2015 and 2019 were recruited
      prospectively. Patients with multiligament injuries or a concomitant lateral
      extra-articular procedure were excluded. Patients were observed in person for 6
      months, and patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) were collected at 2 and 5
      years postoperatively. All patients were contacted, and records were reviewed to 
      determine the incidence of graft failure. PROMs collected were as follows: Knee
      injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), Veterans RAND 12-Item Health
      Survey (VR-12), Tegner and Marx activity scores, and visual analog scale for pain
      (VAS). Results:: A total of 97 patients, with a mean age of 34.7 (±13.4) years,
      were included (76% men; 52 hamstring and 45 patellar tendon grafts). The mean
      graft diameter was 8 (±1) mm. There was 1 rerupture (1.1%) out of the 90 patients
      who were contactable at a mean of 5 years postoperatively. Median KOOS scores at 
      2 years were as follows: Pain, 94; Symptoms, 86; Activities of Daily Living, 99; 
      Sport and Recreation, 82; and Quality of Life, 81. The postoperative scores were 
      significantly higher than the preoperative scores (P < .001). The VR-12 Physical 
      score improved from 43 preoperatively to 55 at 2 years and remained at 56 at 5
      years. The VAS pain, Tegner, and Marx scores were 0, 6, and 9, respectively, at 2
      years postoperatively. There was no difference in PROMs between graft types.
      Conclusion:: This study demonstrates encouraging results of suture tape
      augmentation of autograft ACLR for both hamstring and patellar tendon grafts. The
      failure rate of 1.1% at a mean follow-up of 5 years is lower than published rates
      for reconstruction, and PROMs results are satisfactory. The technique is safe to 
      use and may permit a return to the preinjury sporting level with a lower chance
      of reinjury.

TI  - Intact revision rotator cuff repair stabilizes muscle atrophy and fatty
      infiltration after minimum follow up of two years.
LID - 515
AB  - Background: The extent of fatty infiltration and rotator cuff (RC) atrophy is
      crucial for the clinical results after rotator cuff repair (RCR). The purpose of 
      this study was to evaluate changes in fatty infiltration and RC atrophy after
      revision RCR and to correlate them with functional outcome parameters. Methods:
      Patients who underwent arthroscopic revision RCR for symptomatic recurrent
      full-thickness tear of the supraspinatus tendon between 2008 and 2014 and were
      retrospectively reviewed with a minimum follow up of 2 years. Magnetic resonance 
      imaging (MRI) was performed pre- and postoperatively to assess 1) tendon
      integrity after revision RCR according to Sugaya classification, (2) RC atrophy
      according to Thomazeau classification, and (3) fatty infiltration according to
      Fuchs MRI classification. Constant score (CS) and the American Shoulder and Elbow
      Surgeon (ASES) score were used to correlate functional outcome, tendon integrity,
      and muscle degeneration. Results: 19 patients (17 males and 2 females) with a
      mean age of 57.5 years (range, 34 to 72) were included into the study at a mean
      follow-up of 50.3 months (range, 24 – 101). At final evaluation, 9 patients (47%)
      presented with intact RCR and 10 patients (53%) suffered a re-tear after revision
      repair. No progress of fatty infiltration was observed postoperatively in the
      group with intact RC, atrophy progressed in only 1 out of 9 patient (11%). Fatty 
      infiltration progressed in 5/10 patients (50%) and RC atrophy increased in 2/10
      patients (20%) within the re-tear group. CS (42.7 ± 17.7 preop, 65.2 ± 20.1
      postop) and ASES (47.7 ± 17.2 preop, 75.4 ± 23.7 postop) improved significantly
      from pre- to postoperatively (p < 0.001). A positive correlation between fatty
      infiltration and RC integrity was detected (r = 0.77, p < 0.01). No correlation
      between clinical outcome and tendon integrity or RC atrophy was observed.
      Conclusion: Arthroscopic revision RCR leads to reliable functional outcomes even 
      in case of a recurrent RC retear. An intact RCR maintains the preoperative state 
      of fatty infiltration and muscle atrophy but does not lead to muscle
      regeneration. Level of evidence: Level IV; Therapeutic study.

TI  - Does anterolateral ligament internal bracing improve the outcomes of anterior
      cruciate ligament reconstruction in patients with generalized joint
      hypermobility?
PG  - 320-7
AB  - BACKGROUND:: Generalized joint hypermobility (GJH) is a risk factor for anterior 
      cruciate ligament (ACL) injury and ACL graft failure and is considered an
      indication for anterolateral ligament (ALL) reconstruction. The aim of this
      retrospective study was to compare functional outcomes, rupture rates, and
      residual instability in patients with GJH undergoing isolated ACL reconstruction 
      or combined ACL reconstruction and ALL augmentation with internal bracing
      (ALL-IB). METHODS:: Sixty-eight patients with GJH and unilateral ACL injury were 
      randomly assigned to undergo either isolated ACL reconstruction (Group 1) or
      combined ACL reconstruction and ALL-IB (Group 2). The patients were evaluated
      pre- and postoperatively; their medical histories; physical examination results; 
      anterior knee translation, as measured using the KT-1000 arthrometer; and scores 
      of validated knee assessments were recorded. RESULTS:: Groups 1 and 2 consisted
      of 37 and 31 patients, respectively. The mean follow-up was 30.1±4.1 and 28.1±2.9
      months, respectively. In the final evaluation, the patients in Group 2 showed
      better rotational stability, as evaluated by the pivot-shift test (p=0.013);
      better anteroposterior stability, as evaluated by KT-1000 arthrometry (p=0.001); 
      similar function (p=0.14 for the Lysholm, p=0.11 for the Cincinnati, and p=0.19
      for the International Knee Documentation Committee subjective score); and failure
      rate (p=0.41). CONCLUSION:: The functional outcomes were similar between the
      groups. The stability outcomes after combined ACL and ALL-IB were better than
      those after isolated ACL reconstruction in patients with GJH. However, the
      technique and its results need to be validated in larger patient series and
      prospective randomized controlled trials.

TI  - Midterm outcome and strength assessment after quadriceps tendon refixation with
      suture anchors.
PG  - 869-75
AB  - Purpose: Quadriceps tendon ruptures (QTR) occur predominantly in middle-aged
      patients through violent eccentric contraction that occurs either when trying to 
      regain balance or during a fall on the hyperflexed knee. The aim of this study
      was to quantify midterm postoperative results, including strength potential
      measured via standardized strength tests following acute (< six weeks) quadriceps
      tendon refixation using suture anchors. Methods: All consecutive patients with
      QTR who underwent surgical suture anchor refixation between 2012 and 2019 at a
      single institution with a minimum follow-up of 12 months were retrospectively
      evaluated. Outcome measures included Tegner Activity Scale (TAS), Lysholm score, 
      International Knee Documentation Committee subjective knee form (IKDC), Knee
      injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) subscales, return to work rates,
      and Visual Analog Scale (VAS) for pain. Additionally, a standardized clinical
      examination and an isometric strength assessment of knee extension and flexion
      were performed. Results: A total of 17 patients (median age 61.0 [25–75% IQR
      50.5–72.5]) were available for final assessment at a mean follow-up of 47.1 ± SD 
      25.4 months. The majority of patients were male (82.4%) and most injuries
      occurred due to a fall on the hyperflexed knee (76.5%). The average time interval
      between trauma and surgery was 12.7 ± 7.5 days. Patients achieved a moderate
      level of activity postoperatively with a median TAS of 4 (3–5.5) and reported
      good to excellent outcome scores (Lysholm score: 97 (86.5–100); IKDC:
      80.7 ± 13.5; KOOS subscales: pain 97.2 (93.1–100), symptoms 92.9 (82.5–100),
      activities of daily living 97.1 (93.4–100), sport and recreation function 80
      (40–97.5) and knee-related quality of life 87.5 (62.5–100). All patients were
      able to fully return to work and reported little pain [VAS: 0 (0–0)]. No
      postoperative complications were reported. Strength measurements revealed a
      significant deficit of knee extension strength in comparison to the contralateral
      side (p = 0.011). Conclusion: Suture anchor refixation of acute QTR leads to good
      functional results and high patient satisfaction without major complications.
      Isometric knee extension strength, however, may not be fully restored compared to
      the unaffected side.

TI  - Biomechanical properties of a suture anchor system from human allogenic
      mineralized cortical bone matrix for rotator cuff repair.
LID - 422
AB  - Background: Suture anchors (SAs) made of human allogenic mineralized cortical
      bone matrix are among the newest developments in orthopaedic and trauma surgery. 
      Biomechanical properties of an allogenic mineralized suture anchor (AMSA) are not
      investigated until now. The primary objective was the biomechanical investigation
      of AMSA and comparing it to a metallic suture anchor (MSA) and a bioabsorbable
      suture anchor (BSA) placed at the greater tuberosity of the humeral head of
      cadaver humeri. Additionally, we assessed the biomechanical properties of the SAs
      with bone microarchitecture parameters. Methods: First, bone microarchitecture of
      12 fresh frozen human cadaver humeri from six donors was analyzed by
      high-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography. In total, 18 AMSAs, 
      9 MSAs, and 9 BSAs were implanted at a 60° angle. All three SA systems were
      systematically implanted alternating in three positions within the greater
      tuberosity (position 1: anterior, position 2: central, position 3: posterior)
      with a distance of 15 mm to each other. Biomechanical load to failure was
      measured in a uniaxial direction at 135°. Results: Mean age of all specimens was 
      53.6 ± 9.1 years. For all bone microarchitecture measurements, linear regression 
      slope estimates were negative which implies decreasing values with increasing age
      of specimens. Positioning of all three SA systems at the greater tuberosity was
      equally distributed (p = 0.827). Mean load to failure rates were higher for AMSA 
      compared to MSA and BSA without reaching statistical significance between the
      groups (p = 0.427). Anchor displacement was comparable for all three SA systems, 
      while there were significant differences regarding failure mode between all three
      SA systems (p < 0.001). Maximum load to failure was reached in all cases for
      AMSA, in 44.4% for MSA, and in 55.6% for BSA. Suture tear was observed in 55.6%
      for MSA and in 22.2% for BSA. Anchor breakage was solely seen for BSA (22.2%). No
      correlations were observed between bone microarchitecture parameters and load to 
      failure rates of all three suture anchor systems. Conclusions: The AMSA showed
      promising biomechanical properties for initial fixation strength for RCR. Since
      reduced BMD is an important issue for patients with chronic rotator cuff lesions,
      the AMSA is an interesting alternative to MSA and BSA. Also, the AMSA could
      improve healing of the enthesis. Supplementary Information: The online version

TI  - A suture anchor-based repair technique for type IV jersey finger injuries: a
      biomechanical investigation.
LID - 3493
AB  - The aim of this biomechanical investigation was to evaluate a repair technique
      for type IV FDP tendon avulsions using a suture anchor, addressing the bony and
      the tendinous aspect of this injury simultaneously. In 45 distal phalanges from
      human anatomical specimens the injury was simulated and repairs were performed
      with a suture anchor using an innovative technique, interosseous sutures and a
      combination of screws and an interosseous suture. Repetitive loading for 500
      cycles simulated postoperative mobilization. Repairs were loaded to failure
      thereafter. Elongation of the tendon-suture complex, gap formation at the
      bone-bone contact line and at the bone-tendon insertion line, load at first
      noteworthy displacement (2 mm), load at failure and the mechanism of failure were
      assessed. The suture anchor technique was superior biomechanically considering
      load at failure (mean: 72.8 N), bony gap formation (mean: 0.1 mm) as well as
      tendinous gap formation (mean: 0.7 mm), implying a preferable stability of the
      repair. Overall, this study demonstrates good ex vivo mechanical stability for a 
      proposed suture anchor repair technique for type IV FDP tendon avulsion injuries,
      which might enable early postoperative mobilization in patients. The technique's 
      subcutaneous implant placement and low implant load are expected to reduce
      potential complications observed in other commonly used repair techniques. This
      approach warrants further evaluation in vivo.

TI  - Anterior Talofibular Ligament All-Inside Arthroscopic Reconstruction with
      InternalBrace™ for Chronic Lateral Ankle Instability.
PG  - e937699-1-8
AB  - Background: Anterior talofibular ligament (ATFL) is the most easily injured or
      even broken of ankle sprain. Patients who fail to receive conservative treatment,
      resulting in persistent ankle swelling, painful and functional decline that it is
      so-called chronic lateral ankle instability (CLAI). It makes sense to investigate
      all-inside arthroscopic reconstruction of ATFL with InternalBrace™ for CLAI.
      Material/Methods: We included 108 patients who underwent all-inside arthroscopic 
      ATFL reconstruction with InternalBrace™ for CLAI from January 2018 to April 2020 
      through a retrospective study. Patients age ranged from 19 to 58 years (mean
      35.6±8.7 years). Several elements are used to evaluate the clinical consequences 
      of ankle function, including the American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Society
      (AOFAS), Japanese Society for Surgery of the Foot Ankle-Hindfoot (JSSF), Kofoed, 
      Tegner scores and complications, and the tilt angle of talus (TT) and the
      anterior displacement of talus (ADT) with stressing radiographs were taken to
      measure in follow-ups. Results: All 108 patients had all-inside arthroscopic
      procedures performed smoothly without serious complications. During the follow-up
      period (26.7±2.6 months on average), no recurrence of ankle instability and other
      serious complications happened. The AOFAS, JSSF, Kofoed, and Tegner scores
      significantly increased as time went by postoperatively, which proved
      statistically significant (P<0.01). Regarding stress-radiographic measurements,
      TT significantly decreased from (9.5±1.1)° preoperatively to (2.6±0.6)° at the
      latest follow-up (P<0.01), while ADT significantly decreased from (9.5±1.0) mm
      preoperatively to (2.6±0.6) mm at the latest examination (P<0.01). Conclusions:
      All-inside arthroscopic ATFL reconstruction with the InternalBrace™ for CLAI is
      beneficial for ankle stability, allowing earlier return to activities.

TI  - Isolated Latissimus Dorsi Transfer versus Combined Latissimus Dorsi and Teres
      Major Tendon Transfer for Irreparable Anterosuperior Rotator Cuff Tears.
PG  - 761-73
AB  - Background: Irreparable anterosuperior rotator cuff tears (IASRCTs) present
      significant challenges, especially in young, active patients with limited
      joint-preserving options. Recently, latissimus dorsi (LD) transfer and combined
      latissimus dorsi and teres major (LDTM) transfer have gained attention as a
      potential surgical option. We aimed to compare the clinical and radiological
      outcomes of LD versus combined LDTM transfer in IASRCTs. Methods: In this
      retrospective comparative study, 53 patients with IASRCTs were analyzed after
      undergoing either LD transfer attached to lesser tuberosity (LT) (LD group, n =
      23) or combined LDTM transfer attached to greater tuberosity (GT) (LDTM group, n 
      = 30). Clinical evaluations included the visual analog scale score for pain,
      active shoulder range of motion (ROM), University of California Los Angeles
      Shoulder Score, American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons score, activities of daily
      living that require active internal rotation (ADLIR) scores, and subscapularis
      (SSC)-specific examinations. Radiographic analyses involved assessing
      acromiohumeral distance (AHD), Hamada grade, the rate of anterior glenohumeral
      subluxation reduction, and integrity of the transferred tendon. Results:
      Postoperatively, both groups demonstrated significant improvements in pain and
      clinical scores (p < 0.001). At the 2-year follow-up, the LDTM group showed
      superior internal rotation strength (p < 0.001), ADLIR score (p = 0.017), and
      SSC-specific physical examination results (belly-press, p = 0.027; bear-hug, p = 
      0.031; lift-off, p = 0.032). No significant changes in AHD or Hamada grade were
      observed in either group. At final follow-up, no significant differences were
      found between the 2 groups in terms of AHD (p = 0.539) and Hamada grade (p =
      0.974). Although preoperative anterior glenohumeral subluxation was improved in
      both groups, the LDTM group showed a statistically significantly higher rate of
      restoration compared to the LD group (p = 0.015). Conclusions: While both LD and 
      combined LDTM transfers for IASRCTs improved postoperative pain relief, clinical 
      scores, and active ROM, the combined LDTM transfer attached to GT was superior to
      LD transfer attached to LT in terms of internal rotational strength, ADLIR score,
      and SSC-specific examinations. Neither group showed significant progress in cuff 
      tear arthropathy or decreased AHD at 2-year follow-up; however, the combined LDTM
      transfer notably improved preoperative anterior glenohumeral subluxation.

TI  - Triple Surgical Fixation Technique for an Isolated Greater Trochanter Fracture in
      an Amateur Weightlifter.
LID - e21.00127
AB  - Isolated greater trochanter fractures have been infrequently described in the
      literature and are typically managed conservatively. Functional strength after
      injury to the abductor complex can be markedly affected resulting in a
      Trendelenburg gait and overall abductor weakness. We present a case of a
      35-year-old athlete who underwent surgical fixation because of notable fracture
      displacement and function debility. This case vignette demonstrates the
      importance of using all available interdisciplinary orthopaedic surgery
      literature to provide a patient-specific surgical construct. Our patient
      benefitted from arthroscopic, arthroplasty, and trauma evidence-based medicine to
      successfully treat his displaced greater trochanteric hip fracture. Successful
      surgical fixation was enhanced by combining three different methods of fixation: 
      osteosynthesis with partially threaded screws and washers (DePuy Synthes), suture
      anchor (Arthrex) direct fracture approximation and tendon reinforcement, and a
      knotless double-row suture bridge (Arthrex) tension band construct. The patient
      was able to return weightlifting at 4 months postoperatively with no evidence of 
      weakness or trendelenburg gait.

TI  - Medial patellofemoral ligament reconstruction using nonresorbable sutures yields 
      comparable outcomes to reconstruction with a pedicled quadriceps tendon autograft
      when performed in addition to bony risk factor correction.
PG  - 264-71
AB  - Purpose: To evaluate the results for reconstruction of the medial patellofemoral 
      ligament using synthetic nonresorbable sutures (S-MPFL-R) in comparison to MPFL-R
      using quadriceps tendon autograft (QT-MPFL-R) in patients undergoing simultaneous
      correction of anatomic risk factors for lateral patellar instability (LPI) at a
      minimum of 2 years of follow-up. Methods: Between November 2018 and June 2019, 19
      patients (male/female 8/11; mean age 26 ± 7 years) underwent S-MPFL-R
      (FiberTape®) in combination with the correction of predisposing risk factors for 
      LPI. The control group of 38 patients (male/female 16/22, mean age 26 ± 6 years) 
      who underwent QT-MPFL-R was matched 1:2 by sex, age, anatomic risk factors, and
      concomitant surgical correction of bony risk factors. The Banff Patella
      Instability Instrument 2.0 (BPII 2.0) and a numerical analog scale (NAS 0–10) for
      patellofemoral pain and subjective knee joint function were used to assess
      patients’ reported quality of life before and after surgery. Results: The BPII
      2.0 score increased from 35.0 ± 21.7 points to 79.7 ± 13.3 points (p < 0.0001) in
      the S-MPRL-R group and from 44.3 ± 19.6 points to 80.9 ± 15 points (p < 0.0001)
      in the QT-MPFL-R group from preoperatively to postoperatively, respectively,
      without any significant difference between the groups. In the S-MPFL-R group and 
      QT-MPFL-R group, 95% (18/19) and 92% (35/38) of patients, respectively, crossed
      the minimally clinically important difference reported for the BPII 2.0. NAS
      values for pain and subjective knee joint function improved significantly in both
      groups (p < 0.0001, p < 0.0001) without any significant difference between the
      groups at the final follow-up. Conclusions: This study demonstrates that
      nonresorbable sutures can serve as a viable option for MPFL-R, yielding
      comparable outcomes compared to quadriceps tendon autograft reconstruction when
      performed concomitantly with the correction of anatomic risk factors for LPI.
      This option reduces the need for autologous tendon harvesting or the use of
      allografts for MPFL-R. Level of evidence: Level III.

TI  - Additional suture augmentation to anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with 
      hamstring autografts bring no benefits to clinical results, graft maturation and 
      graft-bone interface healing.
LID - 301
AB  - Background: From the perspective of graft protection and early rehabilitation
      during the maturation and remodeling phases of graft healing, suture augmentation
      (SA) for anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) has attracted more and 
      more attention. Study Design: Retrospective study. Purpose: To determine whether 
      the additional SA affects clinical results, graft maturation and graft-bone
      interface healing during two years follow-up after ACLR. Methods: 20 ACLRs with
      additional SA (ACLR-SA group) and 20 ACLRs without additional SA (ACLR group)
      were performed between January 2020 and December 2021 by the same surgeon and
      were retrospectively analyzed. Pre- and postoperative International Knee
      Documentation Committee (IKDC) scores, Lysholm scores, graft failure and
      reoperation were evaluated. The signal/noise quotient (SNQ) of autografts and the
      signal intensity of graft-bone interface were analyzed. All 40 patients in
      ACLR-SA group and ACLR group completed 2-years follow-up. Results: There was no
      patient in the two cohorts experienced graft failure and reoperation. The
      postoperative IKDC and Lysholm scores have been significantly improved compared
      with preoperative scored in both ACLR-SA group and ACLR group, however, there was
      no significant difference between two groups. The SNQ of proximal graft of
      ACLR-SA group (14.78 ± 8.62 vs. 8.1 ± 5.5, p = 0.041) was significantly greater
      while the grades of graft-bone interface healing of posterior tibial was
      significantly lower than that of ACLR group at 1-year postoperatively (p = 0.03),
      respectively. There were no significant differences between the two groups of the
      SNQ of proximal, distal medial graft segments, and the graft-bone interface
      healing grades of anterior femoral, posterior femoral, anterior tibial and
      posterior tibial at other time points (p>0.05). Conclusions: The additional SA in
      ACLR had no effect on IKDC scores, Lysholm scores, graft maturation and
      graft-bone interface healing at 2-year postoperatively. Our research does not
      support the routine use of SA in ACLR.

TI  - The Use of Synthetic Graft for MPFL Reconstruction Surgery: A Systematic Review
      of the Clinical Outcomes.
LID - 75
AB  - (1) Background: Acute patella dislocation (APD) is a prevalent knee injury, with 
      rates between 5.8–77.8 per 100,000. APD often results in repeat lateral patella
      dislocations due to the instability of the medial patellofemoral ligament (MPFL).
      Non-operative treatments have a 50% recurrence rate. While autologous grafting
      for MPFL has been favored, surgeons are now exploring synthetic grafts. We aimed 
      to assess the effectiveness of synthetic grafts in MPFL reconstruction surgeries 
      for repeated patellar dislocations; (2) Methods: Our research was based on a
      thorough search from the National Institute of Health and Clinical Excellence
      Healthcare Databases, using the Modified Coleman Methodology Score for quality
      assessment; (3) Results: Six studies met the inclusion criteria. A total of 284
      patients and 230 knees were included. Seventy-five percent of patients were
      graded to have excellent-good clinical outcomes using the Crosby and Insall
      Grading System. International Knee Documentation Committee score and Knee injury 
      and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score scores showed 59% and 60% post-operative
      improvement, respectively; (4) Conclusions: All studies showed improvement in
      post-operative functional outcomes and report no serious adverse events. The 6
      mm, LARS (Orthomedic Ltd., Dollard-des-Ormeaux, QC, Canada) proved to have the
      most improvement in post-operative outcomes when used as a double bundle graft.

TI  - Arthroscopic Autologous Coracoacromial Ligament Augment Technique for Particle
      Thickness of Rotator Cuff with at Least Two Years Follow‐Up.
PG  - 2157-66
AB  - Objective: Patch technology has been the new technique in the treatment of
      partial thickness of the rotator cuff tear (PTRCTs) to address the limitation of 
      traditional techniques. Compared with allogeneic patches and artificial
      materials, coracoacromial ligament is obviously closer to their own biology. The 
      purpose of the study was to evaluate the functional and radiographic outcomes
      following arthroscopic autologous coracoacromial ligament augment technique for
      treatment of PTRCTs. Method: This study included three female patients with
      PTRCTs who underwent arthroscopy operation in 2017 with an average age of
      51 years (range from 50 to 52 years). The coracoacromial ligament implant was
      attached to the bursal side surface of the tendon. The clinical results were
      evaluated by American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES) score, Simple Shoulder
      Test (SST), acromiohumeral distance (AHD) and muscle strength before and
      12 months after operation. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed
      24 months after operation to assess the integrity of the anatomical structure of 
      the original tear site. Result: The average ASES score improved significantly
      from 57.3 preoperatively to 95.0 at 1‐year follow‐up. The strength improved
      significantly from grade 3 preoperatively to grade 5 at 1 year. Two of three
      patients underwent the MRI at 2‐year follow‐up. Radiographic released the
      complete healing of rotator cuff tear. No implant‐related serious adverse events 
      were reported. Conclusion: The new technique of using autogenous coracoacromial
      ligament patch augment provides good clinical results on patients with PTRCTs.

TI  - High return to sports and return to work rates after anatomic lateral ankle
      ligament reconstruction with tendon autograft for isolated chronic lateral ankle 
      instability.
PG  - 3862-70
AB  - Purpose: To evaluate clinical outcomes as well as return to sports (RTS) and
      return to work (RTW) rates following anatomic lateral ankle ligament
      reconstruction with a tendon autograft for chronic lateral ankle instability
      (CLAI) in a high-risk population, and to compare these outcome parameters between
      patients having received a gracilis tendon autograft (GT) and free split peroneus
      brevis tendon (PBT) autograft. Methods: Twenty-eight consecutive patients, who
      were diagnosed with CLAI, presenting with ≥ 1 risk factor (ligamentous
      hyperlaxity, insufficient substance of native ligament and/or high-demand
      athlete), who underwent ankle ligament reconstruction with a tendon autograft
      between January 2011 and December 2018, were included in this retrospective
      study. At 63.7 ± 28.0 months (24–112), 23 patients with a mean age of
      29.7 ± 10.9 years were available for follow-up. The Karlsson Score, the Foot and 
      Ankle Outcome Score (FAOS), the Tegner Activity Scale and the visual analog scale
      (VAS) for pain were collected at a minimum follow-up of 24 months. RTS and RTW
      were evaluated by questionnaire. A subgroup analysis with regard to the graft
      used for ankle ligament reconstruction (GT versus PBT) was performed. Results:
      Patients reported a Karlsson score of 82.1 ± 17.5 (37–100), a FAOS score of
      87.8 ± 8.4 (73–99), a median Tegner activity scale of 5.0 (IQR 4–6) and a VAS for
      pain of 0.5 ± 0.9 (0–4) at rest and of 2.0 ± 2.1 (0–7) during activities at final
      follow-up. Postoperatively, 96% of patients had returned to sports after
      8.3 ± 6.2 months. All patients (100%) had returned to work at 3.5 ± 5.7 (0–24)
      months, with 87% reporting an equal or improved working ability compared to that 
      preoperatively. Postoperatively, exercise hours per week were significantly
      reduced compared to preoperatively in patients with a split PBT (n = 12;
      13.0 ± 12.9 to 5.6 ± 6.4 h, p = 0.038) autograft as opposed to patients with a GT
      autograft (n = 11; 13.1 ± 8.7 to 12.4 ± 7.1 h, n.s.). No other group differences 
      were observed. Conclusion: Good patient-reported outcomes as well as excellent
      RTS and RTW rates can be achieved in high-risk patients undergoing ankle ligament
      reconstruction with a tendon autograft for CLAI. These results may be helpful in 
      preoperatively managing patients’ expectations regarding sports- and work-related
      outcomes and provide tangible data on the expectable time frame of the individual
      return to sports and work trajectory. Level of evidence: IV. Supplementary

TI  - Comparison of Modified Broström Procedure with or without Suture Tape
      Augmentation Technique for the Chronic Lateral Ankle Instability.
LID - 6172280
AB  - Purpose: To compare the clinical outcomes of the modified Broström repair (MBR)
      with or without suture tape augmentation (STA) for managing the chronic lateral
      ankle instability. Methods: 72 patients with chronic lateral ankle instability
      treated at our hospital from January 2018 to July 2019 were included, with 37
      patients receiving the MBR and 35 treated by the MBR with STA. The clinical
      efficacy of the two techniques was assessed in terms of VAS, AOFAS, and Karlsson 
      scores and by physical examination in follow-ups. Results: In all 72 patients,
      operations were successful, and the patients were followed up for 29.3 months on 
      average (range, 24-43 months). There were no significant differences in
      preoperative pain, AOFAS, and Karlsson scores between the two groups. Compared
      with preoperative findings, all the functional scores were significantly improved
      in both groups 3 months after the operation and at the last follow-up. Three
      months after the operation, the STA group had significantly lower VAS and higher 
      AOFAS scores than the isolated MBR group, suggesting that patients in the STA
      group suffered less pain and achieved better functional improvement. However, the
      VAS and functional scores at the last follow-up and the Karlsson score at 3
      months postoperatively showed no intragroup difference in both groups.
      Conclusion: MBR with or without STA could achieve good results for the treatment 
      of chronic lateral ankle instability. Compared with the widely used MBR,
      combining with STA may be more effective in promoting rehabilitation in early
      term.

TI  - Recreational activity after open hip abductor repair.
PG  - 5143-8
AB  - Background: Hip abductor tear (HAT) is an increasingly diagnosed cause of
      refractory lateral hip pain and dysfunction, affecting 10–25% of the general
      population. Purpose: (1) to determine the rate of return to activity and to
      assess the physical and recreational activity of patients undergoing open hip
      abductor repair (oHATr) and (2) to describe the modification or initiation of new
      sports disciplines. Study design: Case series; Level of evidence, 4. Methods: A
      total of 28 patients (29 hips) who underwent an oHATr were prospectively analyzed
      at a midterm follow-up of 3.5 (range 2–5) years. The sports and recreational
      activity levels, as well as type of sports practiced before and after surgery,
      and The Veterans RAND 12 Item Health Survey (VR-12) were assessed via
      questionnaire. Results: At the final follow-up, all patients were active in
      sports after surgery. The duration and frequency of sports activities showed a
      slight decrease (48–42 min per week and 3.2–2.9 sessions per week, respectively) 
      (p = 0.412 and 0.135, respectively). The VR-12 had a score of 45 (13.12–63.18)
      points for the physical component and 41 (32–53.8) points for the mental
      component. 100% of the patients would undergo the surgery again. 95% of patients 
      were satisfied with the overall results of the surgical outcome, with 98%
      satisfied with their hip pain relief and ability to undertake daily and work
      activities. Moreover, 94% were satisfied with their ability to return to
      recreational activities. The failure rate in our cohort was approximately 14%.
      Conclusion: All patients who underwent an oHATr were able to return at least to
      one type of sport. This cohort was highly satisfied with their sports involvement
      and recreational activity achievement. In addition, 88% of patients reported that
      oHATr improved sports activity. There was a shift from higher to lower impact
      sports. Furthermore, just 3 hips present a retear after surgery.

TI  - Augmentierte Primärnaht „internal bracing“ nach ligamentärer Ellenbogenluxation.
PG  - 43-55
AB  - Objective: Aim of surgical treatment is the primary stabilization of the unstable
      elbow following a ligamentous elbow dislocation. Indications: Ligamentous elbow
      dislocations are typically accompanied by injuries to the surrounding musculature
      and collateral ligaments of the elbow joint. Surgical treatment is indicated in
      case of failure of nonoperative therapy, i.e., when a dislocation can only be
      prevented in immobilization > 90° and pronation of the elbow or an active
      muscular centering of the elbow fails after 5–7 days. Contraindications:
      Contraindications for a solely “internal bracing” augmented primary suture are
      generally in the case of accompanying bony injuries in elbow dislocations,
      extensive soft-tissue injuries, and septic arthritis of the elbow. Surgical
      technique: The augmented primary suture of the elbow is performed using both
      a lateral (Kocher or Kaplan) and medial (FCU split) approach to the elbow. After 
      reduction of the elbow, the collateral ligaments are first augmented with
      high-strength polyethylene suture and fixed in the distal humerus together with
      another high-strength polyethylene augmentation suture. The extensors and flexors
      are then fixed to the medial and lateral epicondyle, respectively, using suture
      anchors. Postoperative management: The aim of the postoperative management is
      early functional exercise of the elbow. The elbow is placed in an elbow brace to 
      avoid varus and valgus load. Results: Between August 2018 and January 2020,
      a total of 12 patients were treated with an augmented primary suture following
      unstable ligamentous elbow dislocation. After a mean follow-up of
      14 ± 12.7 months, the mean Mayo Elbow Performance Score was 98.5 points with
      a mean functional arc of 115°. None of the patients reported a recurrent
      dislocation or persistent instability of the elbow.

TI  - Consecutive ipsilateral inferior pole patella and superior patella sleeve
      fractures.
PG  - e190-2
AB  - We present a rare, previously undescribed case of a superior patella sleeve
      fracture in a skeletally immature adolescent male, just 1 month following surgery
      for an ipsilateral traumatic inferior pole patella fracture. This was initially
      missed resulting in a delay to surgery. We recommend a high index of suspicion is
      key in these patients who re-present following subsequent trauma and alternative 
      X-ray views such as a flexed lateral can be extremely beneficial.

TI  - Allogeneic Tendon Transplantation for the Treatment of Pathological Patellar
      Ligament Defect in Children: Technical Note and 4‐Year Follow‐Up.
PG  - 3431-40
AB  - Objective: The absence of patellar ligament will bring about a severe negative
      impact on daily life. Many reconstruction techniques have been described in
      adults. However, there is a lack of technical introduction regarding the
      reconstruction of the patellar ligament in children. The purpose of this study
      was to report a surgical technique for reconstructing the patellar ligament in
      children. Method: A retrospective analysis of the clinical data on a patellar
      ligament (tendon sheath fibroma) patient with allogeneic tendon reconstruction.
      An 8‐year‐old child with postoperative recurrence of left patellar ligament tumor
      was enrolled in our study. Anterior tibialis tendon allograft was used to
      reconstruct the patellar ligament after complete resection of the patellar
      ligament for the tumor. The tunnels were constructed on the deep surface of the
      tibial tubercle and the root of the quadriceps tendon (to decrease the harmful
      impact on patella development), respectively. The allogeneic tendon was passed
      through the tunnels above in the shape of “8,” and the two ends of the tendon
      were attached to the bleeding bone bed at the inferior edge of the patella with
      suture anchors to achieve better bone‐tendon healing. During the follow‐up, the
      knee's range of motion and imaging manifestations were recorded. Result:
      Postoperative pathology suggests chondromesenchymal hamartoma, a rare benign soft
      tissue tumor different from the previous operation (tendon sheath fibroma).
      During the 4‐year follow‐up, the patient's active range of motion of the knee
      achieved 0° to 120°; and the patient could walk normally without any external
      help. Physical examinations (the apprehension sign and J sign) showed no
      ligamentous instability or patellar ligament tenderness. Imaging analysis showed 
      that the ratio length of the patellar ligament to the patella was almost normal. 
      The integrity, continuity, and shape of the allogeneic ligament showed excellent 
      results in MRI. Combined with clinical and imaging findings, allogeneic tendon
      patellar ligament reconstruction was deemed successful. Conclusion: Allogeneic
      ligament reconstruction technique can provide a treatment option by
      reconstructing the extensor mechanism, minimizing the impact on patellar
      development, and augmenting biological healing for children with the absence of
      the patellar ligament.
