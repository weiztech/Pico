TI  - Tuberculous peritonitis diagnosed following laparoscopic examination for
      suspected advanced ovarian cancer.
LID - e257973
AB  - Laparoscopy for intra-abdominal exploration and tissue sampling is useful in
      advanced ovarian cancers, in which it is presumed to be difficult to achieve
      complete tumour reduction in the initial surgery. This is a report of a case of
      suspected advanced ovarian cancer in a patient, who underwent laparoscopic
      screening and was later pathologically diagnosed with tuberculous peritonitis. A 
      woman in her 50s visited her local doctor with constipation. Since imaging showed
      massive ascites she was referred for further evaluation. We initially suspected
      advanced ovarian cancer due to the presence of massive ascites and multiple
      peritoneal nodules. However, histopathological examination indicated that the
      nodules were tubercles, and the patient was subsequently diagnosed with
      tuberculous peritonitis. It is important to be aware that tuberculosis
      peritonitis can be misdiagnosed or mistaken for advanced ovarian cancer.
      Preoperative diagnosis of tuberculous peritonitis is often difficult. Tuberculous
      peritonitis should be considered if intraoperative findings show diffuse nodular 
      disseminated lesions.

TI  - Conservative versus Surgical Treatment of Pneumatosis Intestinalis: Experience
      from a Multidisciplinary Center.
PG  - e943166-1-8
AB  - Case series Patients: Male, 80-year-old • Male, 86-year-old • Male, 62-year-old
      Final Diagnosis: Pneumatosis intestinalis Symptoms: Abdominal pain Clinical
      Procedure: — Specialty: Gastroenterology and Hepatolog Objective:: Rare disease
      Background:: Pneumatosis intestinalis (PI) is an uncommon condition that is not
      specific to any particular disease. Currently, there is no specific clinical
      guideline for treating and diagnosing PI. Furthermore, there are numerous causes 
      of PI, which makes it difficult for clinicians – internal medicine physicians as 
      well as surgeons – to take a clinical approach to diagnosis and treatment. Case
      Reports:: We present 3 clinical scenarios with PI. In the first patient there was
      a solitary image of PI, which was treated successfully with parenteral nutrition 
      and intravenous antibiotics, and he was discharged after 5 days. The other 2
      cases, which involve gas in the hepatic portal vein (HPVG), were handled in 2
      distinct ways: surgically and conservatively. One needed diagnostic laparoscopy
      with necrotic segmentectomy and was discharged from the hospital on postoperative
      day 16. The last patient, received resuscitation treatment due to severe
      comorbidities and inability to tolerate surgery. After 3 days, abdominal CT scan 
      revealed no signs of remaining PI. However, the patient was terminally discharged
      after 7 weeks of treatment due to septic shock caused by sacrococcygeal ulcer and
      urinary tract infection. By drawing comparisons among these 3 scenarios, we aim
      to highlight certain indicators for conservative treatment success. Conclusions::
      PI with HPVG is a sign of severe prognosis, which often requires surgical
      intervention. However, the decision to manage conservatively or surgically
      depends on the patient’s condition and other criteria such as peritonitis, free
      fluid in the abdominal cavity, and the presence of shock. Physicians should also 
      weigh the benefits and risks of surgical intervention in critically ill patients.

TI  - Application of hand-sewn esophagojejunostomy in laparoscopic total gastrectomy.
LID - 73
AB  - Objective: To investigate the clinical efficacy and prognostic implication of
      hand-sewn anastomosis in laparoscopic total gastrectomy (LTG). Methods:
      Retrospective analysis is adopted to the clinicopathologic data of 112 patients
      with gastric cancer (GC) who went through LTG in the Department of General
      Surgery, the Second Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University between
      October 2020 and October 2022. Among them, 60 individuals receiving medical care 
      were split into the hand-sewn anastomosis group (Group H, N = 60); while, 52
      individuals were split into the circular stapler anastomosis group (Group C,
      N = 52) The clinical efficacy and prognostic conditions of hand-sewn anastomosis 
      are compared with those of circular stapler anastomosis in the application of
      LTG. Results: The analysis results indicated that no notable difference was
      observed in intraoperative bleeding volume, time to first flatus (TFF),
      postoperative hospitalization duration and postoperative complications among the 
      two groups (P > 0.05). Group H had shorter esophagojejunal anastomosis duration
      (20.0 min vs. 35.0 min) and surgery duration (252.6 ± 19.4 min vs.
      265.9 ± 19.8 min), smaller incisions (5.0 cm vs. 10.5 cm), and lower
      hospitalization costs (58415.0 CNY vs. 63382.5 CNY) compared to Group C
      (P < 0.05). Conclusion: The clinical efficacy and the postoperative complications
      of hand-sewn esophagojejunostomy are basically equivalent in comparison to the
      circular stapler anastomosis in the application of LTG. Its advantage lies in
      shorter esophagojejunal anastomosis duration, shorter surgery duration, smaller
      incisions, lower hospitalization costs and wider adaptability of the location of 
      the tumor.

TI  - Penehyclidine for Prevention of Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting in Patients
      Undergoing Gynecological Laparoscopic Surgery Under Combined Intravenous and
      Inhalation Anesthesia: A Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Trial.
PG  - 685-97
AB  - Purpose: We designed this study to investigate the effect of intravenous use of
      penehyclidine on postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) after gynecological
      laparoscopic surgery. Patients and Methods: Ninety-two Women Patients (Aged ≥ 18)
      Scheduled for Elective Gynecologic Laparoscopy Were Enrolled in the Current
      Study. Patients Were Equally Randomized Assigned Into Penehyclidine group (PHC
      group: received a bolus of penehyclidine 10 μg/kg during the induction of
      anesthesia, then followed by a continuous infusion of 10 μg/kg penehyclidine at a
      fixed rate of 2.0 mL/h in postoperative intravenous analgesia pump over 48h, 0.5 
      mg upper limit respectively) or Control group (received 0.9% saline in replace of
      penehyclidine at the same time points). The primary outcome measure was the
      incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting in the postanesthesia care unit
      and ward area. Quality of Recovery-15 (QoR-15) scores and general comfort
      questionnaire (GCQ) scores were assessed on postoperative day (POD) 1, 2.
      Results: Patients between two groups had comparable baseline characteristics.
      Compared with the Control group, the incidence and severity of PONV,
      postoperative nausea (PON), and postoperative vomiting (POV) were significantly
      lower in the PHC group at 2h (PONV: P = 0.002, P = 0.004, respectively; PON: P = 
      0.018, P = 0.038, respectively; POV: P = 0.011, P = 0.072, respectively), 24h
      (PONV: P = 0.003, P = 0.001, respectively; PON: P = 0.010, P = 0.032,
      respectively; POV: P = 0.006, P = 0.044, respectively), and 48h (PONV: P = 0.003,
      P = 0.002, respectively; PON: P = 0.007, P = 0.019, respectively; POV: P = 0.002,
      P = 0.013, respectively) after surgery. The QoR-15 and GCQ scores of the PHC
      group were significantly higher than those of the Control group at POD 1, 2 (P < 
      0.001; P < 0.001, respectively). Conclusion: Our findings suggest that
      perioperative intravenous application of penehyclidine can effectively prevent
      postoperative nausea and vomiting in gynecological laparoscopic surgery patients 
      and improve postoperative recovery.

TI  - Shifting paradigms: a pivotal study on laparoscopic resection for colovesical
      fistulas in diverticular disease.
LID - 1370370
AB  - Background: Colovesical fistulas (CVFs) pose a challenge in diverticulitis,
      affecting 4% to 20% of sigmoid colon cases. Complicated diverticular disease
      contributes significantly, accounting for 60%−70% of all CVFs. Existing studies
      on laparoscopic CVF management lack clarity on its effectiveness in diverticular 
      cases compared to open surgery. This study redefines paradigms by assessing the
      potentiality, adequacy, and utility of laparoscopy in treating CVFs due to
      complicated diverticular disease, marking a paradigm shift in surgical
      approaches. Methods: Conducting a retrospective analysis at Ospedale Monaldi
      A.O.R.N dei Colli and University Federico II, Naples, Italy, patients undergoing 
      surgery for CVF secondary to diverticular disease between 2010 and 2020 were
      examined. Comprehensive data, including demographics, clinical parameters,
      preoperative diagnoses, operative and postoperative details, and
      histopathological examination, were meticulously recorded. Patients were
      classified into open surgery (Group A) and laparoscopy (Group B). Statistical
      analysis used IBM SPSS Statistic 19.0. Results: From January 2010 to December
      2020, 76 patients underwent surgery for colovesical fistula secondary to
      diverticular disease. Laparoscopic surgery (Group B, n = 40) and open surgery
      (Group A, n = 36) showed no statistically significant differences in operative
      time, bladder suture, or associated procedures. Laparoscopy demonstrated
      advantages, including lower intraoperative blood loss, reduced postoperative
      primary ileus, and a significantly shorter length of stay. Postoperative
      morbidity differed significantly between groups. Mortality occurred in Group A
      but was unrelated to surgical complications. No reoperations were observed.
      Two-year follow-up revealed no fistula recurrence. Conclusion: This pivotal study
      marks a paradigm shift by emphasizing laparoscopic resection and primary
      anastomosis as a safe and feasible option for managing CVF secondary to
      diverticular disease. Comparable conversion, morbidity, and mortality rates to
      the open approach underscore the transformative potential of these findings. The 
      study's emphasis on patient selection and surgeon experience challenges existing 
      paradigms, offering a progressive shift toward minimally invasive solutions.

TI  - Long-Term Efficacy of Single-Incision Laparoscopic Intragastric Resection in
      Treating Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors.
PG  - 193-203
AB  - Background/Aims:: Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs), the most common
      mesenchymal tumors in the gastrointestinal tract, are increasingly treated with
      minimally invasive surgeries. Developed techniques include laparoscopic,
      endoscopic, and hybrid methods for gastric GIST resection. Our study, focusing on
      single-incision laparoscopic intragastric resection for gastric GISTs, aims to
      evaluate its safety, efficacy, and long-term outcomes. Materials and Methods:: In
      a retrospective study of GIST surgery involving 14 patients who underwent
      single-incision laparoscopic intragastric resections, we analyzed and compared
      their preoperative demographics, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA)
      scores, tumor size, neoadjuvant treatment, operation duration, hospital stay,
      mitotic and Ki-67 indexes, and histological features with those of patients who
      underwent open and laparoscopic wedge resections, to assess the impact on both
      survival and disease-free survival. Results:: Average operation time was 93.07
      minutes (range 81-120 minutes). Average blood loss: 67 ± 20 mL (range 40-110 mL).
      Postoperative hospital stay averaged 6.79 days (range 4-16 days). Strong
      correlations were observed between preoperative and pathological tumor sizes (P =
      .001, P < .001). Survival analysis indicated a significant association with ASA
      scores (P = .031), but not with mitotic index, Ki-67, or tumor size. Average
      survival was 80.57 months, with no recurrence or metastasis during follow-up.
      Conclusion:: Based on our experience, the single-incision laparoscopic
      intragastric resection method emerges as a highly efficient, time-saving, and
      gentle oncological procedure, providing a safe and minimally invasive alternative
      resulting in shorter hospital stays and excellent long-term outcomes with minimal
      recurrence. For more definitive conclusions, larger, multicenter, and prospective
      studies are recommended.

TI  - Secondary amenorrhea as the first presentation of Krukenberg tumor arising from
      the gastroesophageal junction in a 34-year-old woman: A case report.
LID - 109472
AB  - Introduction: Krukenberg tumors account for 9 % of metastatic ovarian tumors,
      they usually originate from the stomach and colon and are microscopically
      characterized by the presence of mucus-filled signet-ring cells. Krukenberg tumor
      originating from the gastroesophageal junction is extremely rare, which limits
      establishing proper diagnosis and management. Presentation of case: A 34-year-old
      women presented with a complaint of amenorrhea, ultrasonography showed bilateral 
      ovarian masses, pathological studies revealed Krukenberg tumor,
      immunohistochemistry of the tumor was positive for (CK1, and CK20). Upper GI
      endoscopy revealed the primary lesion located at the inferior esophagus and
      extending to the cardia. Despite marked improvement after introducing a
      chemotherapy regimen of oxaliplatin, calcium folinate and fluorouracil, the
      patient refused to complete her therapeutic course and died 5 months after
      discontinuation. Discussion: Krukenberg tumor may be asymptomatic but may also
      manifest as pelvic pain, bloating, and menstrual cycle abnormalities.
      Immunohistochemistry of Krukenberg tumor is mandatory to determine the primary
      tumor. Positivity of CK1, CK20 and negativity of CK7 indicates the
      gastrointestinal origin of the tumor. Different choices are available for the
      management of Krukenberg tumor but it still has a poor prognosis with an average 
      survival rate of 14 months. Conclusion: Krukenberg tumor from the esophagus is
      rare and still enigmatic in terms of management. In this article, we aim to draw 
      attention into possible presentations of the tumor by providing the first case in
      Syria of Krukenberg tumor originating from the esophagus and presenting as
      secondary amenorrhea and bilateral adnexal masses.

TI  - Hyperreactio Luteinalis: A Rare Phenomenon Complicating Gestational Trophoblastic
      Disease Presenting as Acute Abdomen in the Convalescence Period.
LID - e55382
AB  - The hydatidiform mole is a rare gynaecological condition originating from
      trophoblastic cells, with an incidence of 1-3 per 1000 pregnancies. Theca lutein 
      cysts (TLCs) and an invasive mole are rarely observed in association with a
      partial mole. This case describes an unusual case involving a 17-year-old
      primigravida at 11 weeks of gestation. She presented with abdominal pain and was 
      diagnosed with a molar pregnancy with post-evacuation rupture of TLC, presenting 
      as an acute abdomen, subsequently undergoing laparoscopy. Post-molar pregnancies 
      exhibit a highly variable course, ranging from recurrent pregnancy loss and
      stillbirths to preterm deliveries and recurrent molar pregnancies. Few studies
      are available on obstetric outcomes after a molar pregnancy; most available data 
      originate from national databases and monocentric research.

TI  - Spontaneous Fistula and Abdominal Wall Endometriosis Due to Occult Existence of
      Unicornuate Right Uterus with Rudimentary Non-Communicating Functioning Left
      Horn.
LID - 532
AB  - Accurate diagnosis of Müllerian duct anomalies (MDA) remains a clinical challenge
      even by direct surgical inspection. Although obstetrical complications are more
      frequent in women with MDA, some subtypes allow normal reproduction, further
      delaying the diagnosis. Unicornuate uterus with a rudimentary non-communicating
      functioning horn is a rare form of MDA, susceptible to many gynecologic and
      obstetric complications such as miscarriages, premature birth, hematosalpinx,
      endometriosis, and chronic pelvic pain. We present an entire case pictorial assay
      including preoperative imaging as well as the surgical correction of the uterine 
      anomaly and the associated complication of an occult unicornuate right uterus
      with rudimentary non-communicating functioning left horn (Class U4aC0V0/ European
      Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology/European Society of Gastrointestinal
      Endoscopy Classification) and its natural evolution following a previous
      incomplete surgical treatment. The patient had an emergency left adnexectomy for 
      hematosalpinx and ovarian endometrioma at her local county hospital. After five
      years, the patient presented with severe dysmenorrhea and abdominal endometriosis
      due to blocked retrograde menstruation from a rudimentary, non-communicating
      functioning horn. Surgical treatment with the resection of the rudimentary
      uterine horn, together with the abdominal wall endometriosis lesions, was carried
      out with good outcomes.

TI  - Dorsal approach in laparoscopic extended left hemi-hepatectomy: A case series.
LID - e37336
AB  - Rationale:: The utility of the dorsal approach has been reported for laparoscopic
      left hemi-hepatectomy. Patient concerns:: The aim of the present study is to show
      the usefulness of the dorsal approach for laparoscopic extended
      left-hemi-hepatectomy while ensuring safe identification of hepatic veins and
      dissection of the dorsal tumor margin. Diagnoses:: Tumors requiring extended left
      hemi-hepatectomy. Interventions:: After mobilization of the lateral sector and
      division of the Arantius plate, parenchyma above the Arantius plate is removed to
      expose the root of the middle hepatic vein and left hepatic vein. Each of these
      veins can be isolated separately either intra- or extra-hepatically. After
      removing the parenchyma on the cranial side of the left Glissonean pedicle
      continuous with the exposed hepatic veins, the left Glissonean pedicle is
      isolated using the Glissonean pedicle transection method. After division of the
      left hepatic vein and Glissonean pedicle, segment 4 (in which the main part of
      the tumor is commonly located) is dissected from the anterior plane of the
      paracaval portion of the caudate lobe by the dorsal approach, along with the
      hepatic hilum. Following dissection of the dorsal side of the tumor, and division
      of parenchyma from the anterior edge of the liver, the anterior Glissonean
      branches and middle hepatic vein are divided safely and the specimen is resected.
      Outcomes:: Three patients underwent laparoscopic extended left hemi-hepatectomy, 
      with no open conversions. Operative time and blood loss were 331 (concomitant
      with another partial hepatectomy), 277, and 315 minutes; and 200, 100, and 100 g,
      respectively. The postoperative courses were uneventful. Lessons:: The dorsal
      approach maximizes the advantages of laparoscopic extended left hemi-hepatectomy 
      and can be performed safely.

TI  - Ovarian vein and inferior vena cava thrombosis after vaginal delivery: A case
      report.
LID - e00592
AB  - Ovarian vein thrombosis (OVT) is a rare but serious complication, most commonly
      occurring in the postpartum period. This article reports the case of a
      40-year-old woman who presented 12 days after a normal vaginal delivery with
      fever and pelvic pain. An initial diagnosis of endometritis was made, and empiric
      antibiotic therapy was administered, but the fever persisted. An ultrasound scan 
      was then done to rule out appendicitis, which revealed a thrombosis of the right 
      ovarian vein extended to the inferior vena cava. Appropriate anticoagulant
      therapy was immediately started with spectacular clinical improvement.Ovarian
      vein thrombosis is difficult to diagnose as the signs are nonspecific, like fever
      and pelvic pain; radiological exploration, typically doppler ultrasound and
      computerized tomography, are therefore required. Early treatment is crucial to
      prevent severe complications, especially pulmonary embolism. This case emphasizes
      the need for heightened clinical awareness and a multidisciplinary approach to
      achieve optimal outcomes in managing ovarian vein thrombosis.

TI  - Comparison of military and civilian surgeon outcomes with emergent trauma
      laparotomy in a mature military-civilian partnership.
LID - e001332
AB  - Introduction: Medical readiness is of paramount concern for active-duty military 
      providers. Low volumes of complex trauma in military treatment facilities has
      driven the armed forces to embed surgeons in high-volume civilian centers to
      maintain clinical readiness. It is unclear what impact this strategy may have on 
      patient outcomes in these centers. We sought to compare emergent trauma
      laparotomy (ETL) outcomes between active-duty Air Force Special Operations
      Surgical Team (SOST) general surgeons and civilian faculty at an American College
      of Surgeons verified level 1 trauma center with a well-established
      military-civilian partnership. Methods: Retrospective review of a prospectively
      maintained, single-center database of ETL from 2019 to 2022 was performed. ETL
      was defined as laparotomy from trauma bay within 90 min of patient arrival. The
      primary outcome was to assess for all-cause mortality differences at multiple
      time points. Results: 514 ETL were performed during the study period. 22% (113 of
      514) of patients were hypotensive (systolic blood pressure ≤90 mm Hg) on arrival.
      Six SOST surgeons performed 43 ETL compared with 471 ETL by civilian faculty.
      There were no differences in median ED length of stay (27 min vs 22 min; p=0.21),
      but operative duration was significantly longer for SOST surgeons (129 min vs
      110 min; p=0.01). There were no differences in intraoperative (5% vs 2%; p=0.30),
      6-hour (3% vs 5%; p=0.64), 24-hour (5% vs 5%; p=1.0), or in-hospital mortality
      rates (5% vs 8%; p=0.56) between SOST and civilian surgeons. SOST surgeons did
      not significantly impact the odds of 24-hour mortality on multivariable analysis 
      (OR 0.78; 95% CI 0.10, 6.09). Conclusion: Trauma-related mortality for patients
      undergoing ETL was not impacted by SOST surgeons when compared with their
      civilian counterparts. Military surgeons may benefit from the valuable clinical
      experience and mentorship of experienced civilian trauma surgeons at high volume 
      trauma centers without creating a deficit in the quality of care provided. Level 
      of evidence: Level IV, therapeutic/care management.

TI  - Narrative Review and Consensus Recommendations for the Use of Transnasal
      Humidified Rapid-Insufflation Ventilatory Exchange in Modified Electroconvulsive 
      Therapy.
PG  - 282-9
AB  - Transnasal humidified rapid-insufflation ventilatory exchange (THRIVE) is a safe,
      effective, and novel technique that is currently being used in electroconvulsive 
      therapy (ECT). This study aimed to summarize the clinical practices of THRIVE use
      in ECT to aid physicians and institutions in implementing the best practice
      guidelines for ECT. Thus, we reviewed the current literature and presented our
      consensus on the application of THRIVE in ECT in daily clinical practice. This
      consensus provides information regarding THRIVE use in ECT, including its safety,
      effectiveness, procedures, precautions, special case management, and application 
      in special populations. Moreover, it guides the standardized use of THRIVE in

TI  - Assessment of risk factors of lymph node metastasis and prognosis of Siewert
      II/III adenocarcinoma of esophagogastric junction: A retrospective study.
LID - e37289
AB  - Adenocarcinoma of the esophagogastric junction (AEG) has a high incidence, and
      the extent of lymph node dissection (LND) and its impact on prognosis remain
      controversial. This study aimed to explore the risk factors for lymph node
      metastasis (LNM) and prognosis in Siewert II/III AEG patients. A retrospective
      review of 239 Siewert II/III AEG patients surgically treated at Beijing
      Friendship Hospital from July 2013 to December 2022 was conducted. Preoperative
      staging was conducted via endoscopy, ultrasound gastroscopy, CT, and biopsy.
      Depending on the stage, patients received radical gastrectomy with LND and
      chemotherapy. Clinicopathological data were collected, and survival was monitored
      semiannually until November 2023. Utilizing logistic regression for data analysis
      and Cox regression for survival studies, multivariate analysis identified
      infiltration depth (OR = 0.038, 95% CI: 0.011–0.139, P < .001), tumor deposit
      (OR = 0.101, 95% CI: 0.011–0.904, P = .040), and intravascular cancer embolus
      (OR = 0.234, 95% CI: 0.108–0.507, P < .001) as independent predictors of LNM.
      Lymph nodes No. 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 10, and 11 were more prone to metastasis in the
      abdominal cavity. Notably, Siewert III AEG patients showed a higher metastatic
      rate in nodes No. 5 and No. 6 compared to Siewert II. Mediastinal LNM was
      predominantly found in nodes No. 110 and No. 111 for Siewert II AEG, with rates
      of 5.45% and 3.64%, respectively. A 3-year survival analysis underscored LNM as a
      significant prognostic factor (P = .001). Siewert II AEG patients should undergo 
      removal of both celiac and mediastinal lymph nodes, specifically nodes No. 1, 2, 
      3, 4, 7, 10, 11, 110, and 111. Dissection of nodes No. 5 and No. 6 is not
      indicated for these patients. In contrast, Siewert III AEG patients do not
      require mediastinal LND, but pyloric lymphadenectomy for nodes No. 5 and No. 6 is
      essential. The presence of LNM is associated with poorer long-term prognosis.
      Perioperative chemotherapy may offer a survival advantage for AEG patients.

TI  - Recent Advances in Endometrial Cancer Prevention, Early Diagnosis and Treatment.
LID - 1028
AB  - Simple Summary: Endometrial cancer is the fourth most common female malignancy in
      high socioeconomic index nations and the sixth most common cancer in women
      worldwide. The disease incidence has increased globally by 132% in the last 30
      years, and this trend is set to continue in light of an ageing population and
      increasing levels of obesity and diabetes. Although more women than ever before
      are dying of endometrial cancer, the mortality rates are falling due to recent
      advances in early diagnosis and treatment. Our understanding of the molecular
      drivers of endometrial cancer has increased substantially, and doctors are now,
      for the first time, starting to translate this knowledge into the true
      personalisation of care. This review summarises the recent advances in the field 
      and identifies avenues for future exploration. Abstract: Endometrial cancer is
      the sixth commonest cancer in women worldwide, with over 417,000 diagnoses in
      2020. The disease incidence has increased by 132% over the last 30 years and is
      set to continue to rise in response to an ageing population and increasing global
      rates of obesity and diabetes. A greater understanding of the mechanisms driving 
      endometrial carcinogenesis has led to the identification of potential strategies 
      for primary disease prevention, although prospective evaluation of their efficacy
      within clinical trials is still awaited. The early diagnosis of endometrial
      cancer is associated with improved survival, but has historically relied on
      invasive endometrial sampling. New, minimally invasive tests using protein and
      DNA biomarkers and cytology have the potential to transform diagnostic pathways
      and to allow for the surveillance of high-risk populations. The molecular
      classification of endometrial cancers has been shown to not only have a
      prognostic impact, but also to have therapeutic value and is increasingly used to
      guide adjuvant treatment decisions. Advanced and recurrent disease management has
      also been revolutionised by increasing the use of debulking surgery and targeted 
      treatments, particularly immunotherapy. This review summarises the recent
      advances in the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of endometrial cancer and
      seeks to identify areas for future research.

TI  - Assessment of G10 Intraoperative Scoring System for Conversion in Patients
      Undergoing Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy: A Cross-Sectional Study From Nepal.
LID - e55392
AB  - Introduction: Various preoperative risk factors for conversion in laparoscopic
      cholecystectomy (LC) have been well studied. However, the assessment of
      intraoperative factors for conversion in patients with cholecystitis is unclear. 
      The G10 scoring system, which incorporates 10 parameters, has tried to fill this 
      void by developing a scoring system for the most commonly encountered surgical
      illnesses. So, we aimed to assess the utility of the G10 scoring system among
      patients presenting for LC for symptomatic cholelithiasis (both acute and chronic
      cholecystitis) in the clinical setting of a low- and middle-income
      country.Methods: All the patients undergoing LC were assigned a G10 value.
      Gallbladder surgery was considered easy if the G10 score was <2, moderate (2 ≦
      4), difficult (5 ≦ 7), and extreme (8 ≦ 10). All 10 risk factors were analyzed
      into a binary logistics model, and statistically significant risk factors were
      assessed.Results: Among 177 patients, there were 36 males and 141 females. The
      median age of the patient was 42 years (range 11-79). There were 70 easy, 89
      moderate, and 18 difficult cases. The overall mean G10 score was 2.32±1.5, which 
      significantly increased as the severity progressed, with a mean value of 5.5±0.51
      for difficult cases (P=0.0001). The mean G10 score for surgeries completed
      laparoscopically was 2.1±1.4, while it was 3.71±1.4 for open
      conversions [P=0.0001, AUC=0.79, CI=0.70-0.87]. There were 18 patients with G10
      ≥5 with a conversion rate of 27.7%, while the overall conversion rate was 13.6%. 
      Multivariate analysis showed free bile or pus outside the gallbladder [P=0.02,
      OR=5.1, CI=1.2-21.1] and fistula [P=0.01, OR=15.8, CI=1.9-129.8] as significant
      risk factors for conversion.Conclusion: Intraoperative risk factors for the
      prediction of conversion included the presence of free bile or pus outside the
      gallbladder and cholecystoenteric fistula. Based on the F1 score analysis,
      complemented with the Youden Index, the optimal cutoff value for conversion,
      based on the G10 score, lies around 4. Broader application and validation of the 
      G10 scoring system are mandated to assess the utilization of this novel
      intraoperative scoring system.

TI  - Inguinal endometriosis: a case series and review of the literature.
LID - 83
AB  - Background: Inguinal endometriosis is one of the most common forms of
      endometriosis. The present study introduces 8 cases of inguinal endometriosis and
      discusses probable theories of inguinal endometriosis by reviewing the
      literature. Case presentation: 8 Iranian cases of inguinal endometriosis with a
      mean age of 36 years were presented. Catamenial groin pain and swelling were the 
      most common complications. Also, patients usually had accompanying symptoms such 
      as pelvic pain and dysmenorrhea. One-half of patients had a history of previous
      abdominal surgery. Ultrasound was diagnostic in 4 patients (50%), and magnetic
      resonance imaging was used in two patients (25%). Among 6 patients who underwent 
      hormonal therapy, 4 experienced an endometriosis size increase. Inguinal
      endometriosis was right-sided in 87.5% of patients, and among 4 patients who
      underwent surgery, 75% had proximal site involvement of the round ligament.
      Conclusion: According to the rarity of inguinal endometriosis, it is more likely 
      to be a misdiagnosis with other inguinal disorders such as inguinal hernia.
      Inguinal endometriosis should be considered in patients who undergo inguinal
      herniorrhaphy, with suspected findings such as thickening of the hernia sac wall,
      bloody fluid inside the sac, or thickening of the extraperitoneal round ligament 
      during the surgery.

TI  - Reproductive outcome after in vitro fertilization in endometriosis – key factors 
      and implications.
PG  - 334-40
AB  - Endometriosis is a benign chronic disease with a major impact on a woman’s
      quality of life, mainly due to painful physical symptoms. Endometriosis is also a
      common cause of infertility caused by low ovarian reserve, distorted pelvic
      anatomy, and severe local inflammation with a direct negative impact on the
      quality of oocytes, embryos, and endometrium. We conducted a retrospective study 
      between January 2019 and December 2023, including women with a history of surgery
      for endometriosis who underwent in vitro fertilization (IVF) to achieve
      pregnancy. Their reproductive outcome was compared with a group of patients with 
      documented tubal obstruction. The aim of our study was to identify the factors
      associated with a positive impact on the pregnancy rate, specifically age,
      anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH), ovarian stimulation protocol, and types of
      gonadotropins used. We analyzed a group of 175 patients with endometriosis
      compared with 189 patients with tubal obstruction. The average age was similar
      between the two groups but with a difference in the average AMH value (1.63 ±
      1.09 ng/mL vs. 2.55 ± 1.67 ng/mL). The most utilized ovarian stimulation protocol
      in both groups was the short gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) antagonist.
      The clinical pregnancy rate was 27.2% in the endometriosis group and 54.7% in the
      tubal obstruction group. Our study revealed that treatment with corifollitropin
      alfa in the endometriosis group was associated with a higher clinical pregnancy
      rate. AMH and age proved to be significant independent factors for the
      reproductive outcome.

TI  - Surgical treatment of cryptorchidism: current insights and future directions.
LID - 1327957
AB  - Cryptorchidism presents with an incidence of 1-5% with potential long-term
      implications on future fertility and overall health. This review focuses on
      surgical treatment modalities, their impact on testicular development, and
      function while addressing the Nordic consensus statement as well as current
      European Association of Urology (EAU) and American Urological Association (AUA)
      guidelines. Congenital and acquired cryptorchidism present distinctive challenges
      in surgical management, with different implications for fertility. While
      congenital cryptorchidism entails a risk to fertility and warrants early
      intervention, both retractile testes and acquired cryptorchidism also pose risks 
      to fertility potential, underscoring the importance of evaluating treatment
      options. Testicular location and the child’s age form the basis of a practical
      classification system for undescended testicles. Early diagnosis by clinical
      examination enables timely treatment. Imaging is reserved for selected cases
      only. Following guidelines, orchidopexy is recommended between 6-12 months of age
      for congenital cryptorchidism. Evidence increasingly suggests the benefits of
      early surgery for promoting testicular health and fertility potential. Current
      surgical options range from open to laparoscopic techniques, with the choice
      largely determined by the location and accessibility of the undescended testicle.
      The advancement in laparoscopic approaches for non-palpable testes underscores
      the evolving landscape of surgical treatment. Sequential surgeries may be
      required depending on the mobility of the undescended testes. More research is
      needed to explore both the potential and limitations of hormonal therapy, which
      is secondary to surgical treatment and can selectively have a role as adjunct to 
      surgery. Long-term follow-up is imperative to evaluate fertility outcomes, risk
      of testicular malignancy, and psychological impact. By integrating current
      guidelines with the latest evidence, this review intends to facilitate a
      comprehensive understanding of cryptorchidism, thereby optimizing patient
      management and outcomes.

      intravenous piperacillin/tazobactam and gentamicin and was resuscitated with
      intravenous crystalloid infusion. A radiological diagnosis of splenic infarct
      secondary to splenic artery aneurysm superimposed with splenic abscess was
      presumed, however at emergency laparotomy, primary splenic abscess was
      identified. This abscess had eroded the left hemidiaphragm and had ruptured the
      splenic capsule leading to intra-abdominal pus in the pelvis which on culture
      grew Salmonella Typhimurium. A splenectomy and primary repair of the left
      hemidiaphragm were performed, with postoperative pancreatitis diagnosed following
      the procedure. After intensive care treatment, this patient made a full recovery.
      Conclusion: This case of primary splenic abscess was treated successfully with a 
      combination of surgery (i.e.: splenectomy and surgical drainage), prolonged
      antimicrobial therapy, and intensive care in the perioperative period.

TI  - Pancreatic Arteriovenous Malformations: A Case From Saudi Arabia.
LID - e55340
AB  - Arteriovenous malformation (AVM) of the gastrointestinal tract is a rare anomaly,
      mostly due to congenital reasons. Patients with pancreatic AVM can live without
      experiencing symptoms. It can present with gastrointestinal bleeding or portal
      hypertension, and diagnosis can be made by computed tomography (CT) or
      angiography. CT findings include multiple discrete intrapancreatic vessels.A
      48-year-old man complained of abdominal pain with a sensation of fullness that
      radiated to the back for a month, associated with shortness of breath, loss of
      appetite, and unintentional weight loss of 33% in one month without nausea or
      vomiting. On physical examination, the abdomen was soft and lax with epigastric
      tenderness and a negative Murphy sign. Laboratory investigations showed high
      amylase with normal liver and kidney functions. CT showed pancreatic AVM. He
      underwent partial pancreatectomy and splenectomy. After the surgery, the patient 
      reported an improvement in symptoms. All follow-up visits were
      uneventful.Pancreatic AVM is a rare disease, and the most significant chief
      complaint of most patients is gastrointestinal tract bleeding. It requires
      imaging depending on the signs and symptoms. The primary imaging modality is CT, 
      with subtraction angiography for confirmation. Surgical treatment is the standard
      of management for most patients when tolerable. Additionally, early detection of 
      these rare anomalies can avoid massive gastrointestinal tract bleeding and the
      development of resistance portal hypertension and can save patients’ lives if
      bleeding occurs.

TI  - Eosinophilic enterocolitis in duodenum, ileum, and colon: A case report.
LID - e26885
AB  - Eosinophilic gastroenteritis (EGE) is a rare disease which mainly consists of an 
      abnormal eosinophile infiltration of the gastrointestinal tract. It’s classified 
      according to its location: eosinophilic esophagitis, eosinophilic gastritis,
      eosinophilic enteritis (including duodenum, jejunum and/or ileum) and
      eosinophilic colitis and degree of infiltration (mucosal, muscular, serosal).
      Depending on eosinophile concentration, type of EGE and the patient’s condition
      it may manifest with different clinical presentations such as functional
      dyspepsia, abdominal pain, irritability, hypoproteinemia, diarrhea, anemia, among
      others. Few research has been done on such an uncommon pathology to the extent
      that treatment evidence is mostly limited to small case series. This case study
      reports an infrequent presentation of EGE in the small and large intestine as an 
      undifferentiated gastrointestinal disease and successful corticoid management
      given to the patient in order to further broaden knowledge on this subject and
      facilitate an established clinical conduct for the treating physician.

TI  - Prediction of Perianal Fistula in Crohn’s Disease by Computed Tomography
      Enterography.
PG  - 168-77
AB  - Background/Aims:: The purpose of this study was to investigate whether computed
      tomography enterography can be used to predict the presence of perianal fistula
      in Crohn’s disease patients. Materials and Methods:: According to the
      presentation of perianal fistula or not, this study divided retrospectively
      included Crohn’s disease patients into 2 groups. The disease duration, incidence 
      of involved intestinal segments, and scoring of the activity of the lesions in
      all patients were statistically analyzed to explore significant factors between
      the 2 groups. The statistically significant findings identified in the univariate
      analysis were incorporated into the multivariate analysis. Logistic regression
      models were subsequently constructed to assess the predictive factors associated 
      with the occurrence of perianal fistula in individuals with Crohn’s disease.The
      contribution of each factor to the outcome variable was confirmed by the
      nomogram. The clinical utility of the nomogram was confirmed by calibration and
      decision curves. Results:: There were 40 cases with perianal Crohn’s disease and 
      58 without perianal Crohn’s disease. After univariate and multivariate analysis, 
      disease duration (early stage of Crohn’s disease), ascending colon, and rectum
      were identified as the independent predictive factors for perianal fistula in
      Crohn’s disease patients. The clinical utility of the nomogram was effective,
      which implied potential benefits for Crohn’s disease patients. Conclusion::
      Computed tomography enterography can be used to predict the presence of perianal 
      fistula in Crohn’s disease patients by analyzing the location and the stage of
      the disease.

TI  - Can We Predict Renal Function Recovery After Pyeloplasty in Pediatrics with
      Ureteropelvic Junction Obstruction? A Systematic Review.
PG  - 85-93
AB  - Chronic unilateral renal obstruction, primarily caused by ureteropelvic junction 
      obstruction (UPJO), poses challenges in determining the optimal timing for
      corrective surgery. The goal is to preserve renal function and alleviate
      symptoms, but there is no definitive diagnostic test to reliably predict the
      outcomes of surgery. This systematic review aimed to identify predictors for
      renal function recovery after pyeloplasty in order to guide effective treatment
      options. We conducted a systematic review following the Preferred Reporting Items
      for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis guidelines. A literature search was
      performed on PubMed, Embase, and Scopus using keywords related to renal function,
      pyeloplasty, and predictors. The search was conducted on March 10, 2022. The
      quality of the included studies was assessed using the Newcastle–Ottawa Scale.
      Out of 344 potentially relevant articles, 11 met the eligibility criteria for
      this study. These included 6 retrospective and 5 prospective studies, with a
      total of 925 participants. Most studies evaluated renal function using
      differential renal function (DRF). The overall quality of the included studies
      was considered average. The findings indicated that age at the time of surgery
      and gender did not significantly influence functional recovery after pyeloplasty.
      However, preoperative DRF consistently emerged as a critical predictor.
      Preoperative DRF can serve as the most common predictors used for renal function 
      recovery following pyeloplasty. These findings contribute to understanding
      effective treatment options for chronic unilateral renal obstruction. However,
      further research for each predictor is needed to validate these predictors and
      their clinical utility.

TI  - Clinical analysis of uterine parameters evaluated by preoperative magnetic
      resonance imaging in patients treated by hysteroscopic approach with previous
      cesarean scar defect-related abnormal uterine bleeding: a retrospective cohort
      study.
PG  - 2334-44
AB  - Background: As the cesarean delivery rate continues to rise globally, the
      treatment of previous cesarean scar defects (PCSD) remains challenging. This
      study aimed to analyze the variables that may influence the clinical cure rate of
      patients with PCSD-related abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB) as determined by
      preoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) following hysteroscopic therapy.
      Methods: Women who underwent hysteroscopic surgery for PCSD-related AUB at the
      Gynecology Department of Third Xiangya Hospital of Central South University from 
      2018 to 2022 were recruited to this retrospective cohort investigation. A total
      of 147 patients were enrolled in this study and underwent follow-up over 6
      months. The significance of clinical characteristics linked to the clinical cure 
      rate of AUB was examined by logistic regression. Results: There were 64
      clinically cured (43.5%) and 83 non-clinically cured (56.5%) patients in the
      study. There were no significant differences in the age, menstrual duration,
      gravidity, parity, number of cesarean sections, time since the previous cesarean 
      section, uterus position, width, depth, and thickness of the remaining muscle
      layer of the defect by MRI T2-weighted images (T2WI) before hysteroscopic surgery
      between the 2 groups. MRI T2WI of the myometrial thickness adjacent to the defect
      [P=0.038, odds ratio (OR) =2.095, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.047–4.261] and 
      the distance from the defect to the external cervical os (P=0.021, OR =2.254, 95%
      CI: 1.136–4.540) before hysteroscopic surgery are risk factors for the clinical
      cure rate. Conclusions: The myometrial thickness adjacent to the defect and the
      distance from the defect to the external cervical os in preoperative MRI are risk
      factors for clinical cure rate in patients with PCSD-related AUB after
      hysteroscopic treatment, which is helpful for evaluating the prognosis of
      disease.

TI  - The impact of different clinicopathologic factors and salvage therapies on
      cervical cancer patients with isolated para-aortic lymph node recurrence.
LID - 54
AB  - Background: Cervical cancer patients with isolated para-aortic lymph nodes (PALN)
      recurrence were mainly associated with treatment failure. For these patients,
      radiotherapy, chemotherapy, surgery ± adjuvant therapy or chemoradiotherapy may
      be advised, however, no specific therapy has been proposed yet. This study aimed 
      to explore factors influencing the prognosis of cervical cancer cases with
      isolated PALN recurrence and to find out an effective salvage therapy. Methods:
      Cervical cancer cases with isolated PALN recurrence who received therapies in
      Zhejiang Cancer Hospital between January 2013 and June 2021 were analyzed
      retrospectively. Results: Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) level > 10 ng/mL and
      positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) imaging method used to 
      detect the recurrence were found to be associated with the local control rate.
      PALN (positive), squamous-cell carcinoma-antigen (SCC-Ag) level (> 10 ng/mL) upon
      initial diagnosis, and CEA level (> 10 ng/mL), number of metastatic lymph nodes
      (several) at recurrence were associated with worse survival. Compared with
      surgery ± adjuvant therapy, chemotherapy (CT) alone or sequential
      chemoradiotherapy (SCRT) was associated with worse PFS or OS. Concurrent
      chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) after PALN recurrence could reduce the risk of the
      second recurrence. 3-year OS of cases after surgery ± adjuvant therapy was the
      highest (65%), followed by CCRT (45.7%), SCRT (38.9%), radiotherapy (RT) (33.3%),
      and CT (20.6%). Conclusion: In cervical cancer patients with isolated PALN
      recurrence, chemoradiotherapy or surgery ± adjuvant therapy may be preferred as
      the salvage treatment. Supplementary Information: The online version contains

TI  - A Clinical Review and Experience of Splenic Trauma in North India: A
      Retrospective Observational Study.
LID - e55384
AB  - Introduction: The spleen is one of the frequently injured solid organs in
      abdominal blunt trauma. The standard of care is nonoperative nowadays depending
      on the hemodynamic stability (World Society of Emergency Surgery (WSES) grade
      I-III) of the patient due to advancements in treating modalities. Operative
      interventions are required in hemodynamically unstable patients or failure of
      nonoperative management. The study was planned to find the clinical spectrum of
      abdominal blunt trauma, specifically those having splenic trauma, and their
      subsequent management in an institution.Methods: This is a retrospective
      observational study. All included patients with blunt abdominal injuries were
      treated in a level 1 trauma center between July 2021 and December 2022. Data
      regarding demographic profile, blood transfusion, pre- and postoperative
      findings, and management including the period of hospital stay, morbidity, and
      mortality were collected and analyzed.Results: One hundred sixty-four patients
      were analyzed, of which 142 were males and 22 were females. The commonest
      mechanism of injury was motor vehicle collision, followed by falls. Grade III
      splenic injury was the most common injury, while the predominantly associated
      injury was rib fracture. The patients were managed preferably through
      nonoperative management, followed by angioembolization and operative management. 
      The commonest postoperative complication was pneumonia.Conclusions: Nonoperative 
      management of splenic trauma has evolved as the standard of care replacing
      operative management in order to sustain its immune function, thereby preventing 
      overwhelming post-splenectomy infection.

TI  - Identifying therapeutic candidates for endometriosis through a
      transcriptomics-based drug repositioning approach.
LID - 109388
AB  - Existing medical treatments for endometriosis-related pain are often ineffective,
      underscoring the need for new therapeutic strategies. In this study, we applied a
      computational drug repurposing pipeline to stratified and unstratified disease
      signatures based on endometrial gene expression data to identify potential
      therapeutics from existing drugs, based on expression reversal. Of 3,131 unique
      genes differentially expressed by at least one of six endometriosis signatures,
      only 308 (9.8%) were in common; however, 221 out of 299 drugs identified, (73.9%)
      were shared. We selected fenoprofen, an uncommonly prescribed NSAID that was the 
      top therapeutic candidate for further investigation. When testing fenoprofen in
      an established rat model of endometriosis, fenoprofen successfully alleviated
      endometriosis-associated vaginal hyperalgesia, a surrogate marker for
      endometriosis-related pain. These findings validate fenoprofen as a therapeutic
      that could be utilized more frequently for endometriosis and suggest the utility 
      of the aforementioned computational drug repurposing approach for endometriosis.

TI  - What else should hemostatic materials do beyond hemostasis: A review.
LID - 101008
AB  - Massive blood loss due to injury is the leading cause of prehospital deaths in
      disasters and emergencies. Hemostatic materials are used to realize rapid
      hemostasis and protect patients from death. Researchers have designed and
      developed a variety of hemostatic materials. However, in addition to their
      hemostatic effect, hemostatic materials must be endowed with additional functions
      to meet the practical application requirements in different scenarios. Here,
      strategies for modifications of hemostatic materials for use in different
      application scenarios are listed: effective positioning at the site of deep and
      narrow wounds to stop bleeding, resistance to high blood pressure and wound
      movement to maintain wound formation, rapid and easy removal from the wound
      without affecting further treatment after hemostasis is completed, and continued 
      function when retained in the wound as a dressing (such as antibacterial,
      antiadhesion, tissue repair, etc.). The problems encountered in the practical use
      of hemostatic materials and the strategies and progress of researchers will be
      further discussed in this review. We hope to provide valuable references for the 
      design of more comprehensive and practical hemostatic materials.

PG  - 859-79
AB  - Artificial vision systems pervade our daily lives as a foremost sensing apparatus
      in various digital technologies, from smartphones to autonomous cars and
      robotics. The broad range of applications for conventional vision systems
      requires facile adaptation under extreme and dynamic visual environments.
      However, these current needs have complicated individual visual components for
      high-quality image acquisition and processing, which indeed leads to a decline in
      efficiency in the overall system. Here, we review recent advancements in visual
      components for high-performance visual processing based on strategies of
      biological eyes that execute diverse imaging functionalities and sophisticated
      visual processes with simple and concise ocular structures. This review first
      covers the structures and functions of biological eyes (i.e., single-lens eyes
      and compound eyes), which contain micro-optic components and nanophotonic
      structures. After that, we focus on their inspirations in imaging
      optics/photonics, light-trapping and filtering components, and retinomorphic
      devices. We discuss the remaining challenges and notable biological structures
      waiting to be implemented.

TI  - Effects of Indigo Carmine on Growth, Cell Division, and Morphology of Allium cepa
      L. Root Tip.
LID - 194
AB  - Indigo carmine has a variety of uses in foods, textiles, medicine,
      pharmaceuticals, and cosmetics. There are studies reporting the toxic potential
      of indigo carmine on human health and the environment. In this study, we
      investigated the cytogenotoxic effects of indigo carmine using apical root cells 
      of Allium cepa. Allium cepa bulbs were subjected to four treatments with indigo
      carmine (0.0032, 0.0064, 0.0125, and 0.2 mg/mL) and to ultrapure water as a
      control. After 5 days, root growth, root length, mitotic index, mitotic
      inhibition, chromosomal anomalies, and cell morphology were analyzed. According
      to our results, a decrease in root length and mitotic index was observed at all
      concentrations of indigo carmine. Additionally, several types of chromosomal
      abnormalities were observed, such as disturbed metaphase, sticky chain metaphase,
      anaphase bridge, and laggard chromosomes. Moreover, histological observation
      indicated that indigo carmine induces alterations in various components of root
      tip tissue, such as deformation and alteration of the cell wall, progressive
      condensation of chromatin, shrinkage of the nuclei, and an increase in the number
      of irregularly shaped nuclei and nuclear fragments. Our results indicate that the
      tested concentrations of indigo carmine may have toxic effects and raise concerns
      about its intensive use in many fields.

      determined to be caused by the zoonotic Taenia martis tapeworm. Subsequent
      testing revealed that 15% of wild martens tested in that region were infected
      with T. martis tapeworms with 100% genetic similarity; thus, the infection source
      was most likely local.

TI  - Synchronous Double Primary Angiosarcoma Originating from the Stomach and Rectum: 
      A Case Report and a Literature Review.
PG  - 168-73
AB  - Angiosarcomas originating from the gastrointestinal tract are rare but highly
      aggressive tumors with poor prognosis. These tumors can be misdiagnosed as benign
      and malignant gastrointestinal tract lesions. The definitive histological
      diagnosis of angiosarcomasis made by pathologists based on immunohistochemical
      analysis demonstrating cluster of differentiation 31 (CD31), factor VIII-related 
      antigen (FVIIIRAg), erythroblast transformation specific related gene (ERG), and 
      cluster of differentiation 34 (CD34). Angiosarcomas are treated with a single or 
      multimodality approach that may include resection, radiotherapy, chemotherapy,
      and palliative care, depending on the stage of disease and the condition of the
      patient. No matter the treatment option, metastasis and death rates are
      substantially highin patients with angiosarcoma. In this context, a 59-year-old
      male with synchronous double primary angiosarcoma arising from the gastric and
      rectum who presented with the complaint of abdominal pain and distention to the
      outpatient clinic is presented in this case report, along with a brief literature
      review.

TI  - The crucial role of age and site in incidence and prognosis of female
      neuroendocrine neoplasms in the United States: a population-based study from 2000
      to 2018.
PG  - 4204-23
AB  - Background: As the incidence continues to rise, global concern about
      neuroendocrine neoplasms (NENs) is mounting. However, little is known about how
      NENs affect women patients.Methods: The annual percentage change (APC) was
      calculated to describe the incidence. Cox proportional hazards multivariable
      regression was used to identify risk factors. The nomograms were employed to
      estimate prognosis.Results: A total of 39,237 female NENs (fNENs) cases were
      identified. The incidence of fNENs increased annually (APC = 4.5, 95% CI 4.1-4.8,
      P < 0.05), and the incidence pattern and survival outcomes showed age and
      site-specificity. Appendiceal, rectal, and pulmonary fNENs were major
      contributors to the incidence of patients younger than 40, between 40-59, and
      over 60 years old, respectively. The Cox proportional hazards regression model
      revealed that age, tumor size, grade, stage, and primary sites were closely
      related to survival. The worst survival outcomes appeared in breast, reproductive
      system, and liver fNENs for patients under 40, between 40-49, and over 50 years
      old, respectively. A nomogram based on these developed with higher predictive
      accuracy of prognosis, with a C index of 0.906 in the training cohort and 0.901
      in the validation cohort.Conclusions: Our findings revealed distinct
      site-specific tendencies in the incidence and survival patterns among fNEN
      patients across various age groups. Thus, reasonable patient screening and
      stratification strategies should be implemented, especially for young patients.

PG  - 357-61
AB  - Noninvasive molecular imaging of acute graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) after
      allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation has great potential to detect 
      GvHD at the early stages, aid in grading of the disease, monitor treatment
      response, and guide therapeutic decisions. Although the specificity of currently 
      available tracers appears insufficient for clinical GvHD diagnosis, recently,
      several preclinical studies have identified promising new imaging agents
      targeting one or more biologic processes involved in GvHD pathogenesis, ranging
      from T-cell activation to tissue damage. In this review, we summarize the
      different approaches reported to date for noninvasive detection of GvHD using
      molecular imaging with a specific focus on the use of PET. We discuss possible
      applications of molecular imaging for the detection of GvHD in the clinical
      setting, as well as some of the predictable challenges that are faced during
      clinical translation of these approaches.

TI  - Update on the Screening, Diagnosis, and Management of Cholangiocarcinoma.
PG  - 151-8
AB  - Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) is a neoplasm of the biliary tract that has become
      increasingly prevalent throughout the world. Common risk factors for developing
      CCA include cirrhosis, primary sclerosing cholangitis, and trematode fluke
      infestation, although there are no set screening guidelines in high-risk groups. 
      Lesions are typically identified via cross-sectional imaging and/or elevated
      serum carbohydrate antigen 19-9 levels, often followed by cytology or brushings
      with fluorescence in situ hybridization for confirmation. Treatments can vary
      among CCA subtypes but frequently involve systemic therapies such as gemcitabine 
      and cisplatin with durvalumab or pembrolizumab. Targeted therapies may also be
      effective (eg, ivosidenib, pemigatinib, infigratinib, futibatinib) depending on
      the molecular alterations present. Resection is the most common surgical
      treatment for CCA, although liver transplantation is also an option in highly
      selected patients with liver-limited unresectable disease. Radiotherapy may also 
      be a treatment option, as well as transarterial radioembolization (eg,
      yttrium-90), which is often utilized in combination with systemic therapy.
      Although patients with CCA have traditionally had a poor prognosis, recent
      advances in treatment, including new systemic therapies and increased utilization
      of liver transplantation, have improved expected survival. This article reviews
      screening modalities, pros and cons of diagnostic techniques, and therapies that 
      are currently available to treat patients with CCA.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing nearly every aspect of modern
      life. In the medical field, robotic surgery is the sector with some of the most
      innovative and impactful advancements. In this narrative review, we outline
      recent contributions of AI to the field of robotic surgery with a particular
      focus on intraoperative enhancement. AI modeling is allowing surgeons to have
      advanced intraoperative metrics such as force and tactile measurements, enhanced 
      detection of positive surgical margins, and even allowing for the complete
      automation of certain steps in surgical procedures. AI is also Query
      revolutionizing the field of surgical education. AI modeling applied to
      intraoperative surgical video feeds and instrument kinematics data is allowing
      for the generation of automated skills assessments. AI also shows promise for the
      generation and delivery of highly specialized intraoperative surgical feedback
      for training surgeons. Although the adoption and integration of AI show promise
      in robotic surgery, it raises important, complex ethical questions. Frameworks
      for thinking through ethical dilemmas raised by AI are outlined in this review.
      AI enhancements in robotic surgery is some of the most groundbreaking research
      happening today, and the studies outlined in this review represent some of the
      most exciting innovations in recent years.
