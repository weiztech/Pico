NCT02772783,"Dietary Glycemic Index, Brain Function and Food Intake in Patients With Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02772783,,COMPLETED,"Processed carbohydrates cause rapid changes in blood sugar and have been associated with overeating and obesity. We have shown that test meals high in processed carbohydrate affect brain areas involved in addiction, craving and overeating. It is unknown whether the changes in blood sugar or the associated higher insulin levels mediate this brain activation and its likely adverse effects.

Answering this question is important for patients with type 1 diabetes who have elevated risks of obesity and disordered eating: If blood sugar is the causal mechanism, optimal insulin coverage should be protective. If insulin is the causal mechanism, however, a diet high in processed carbohydrate could predispose to overeating and weight gain, as this diet requires higher insulin doses.

NCT01467063,Glutamine and Insulin Sensitivity in Type I Diabetes,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01467063,,COMPLETED,"Insulin is crucial to help the body metabolize ('burn') sugar (glucose). Even though juvenile (type 1) diabetes (T1D) is primarily due to the lack of insulin, patients with T1D tend to become less sensitive to insulin, particularly during adolescence.

The overall objective of this project is to gain further insight into the possible benefits of supplementation with glutamine (GLN), a natural dietary amino acid, enhancing insulin sensitivity in adolescents with T1D. To elucidate the impact of glutamine, the investigators will use a method called the 'euglycemic, hyperinsulinemic clamp': it consists of giving an IV drip of insulin, while the drop in blood sugar is prevented by giving variable, precisely measured amounts of glucose by vein: the amount of glucose required to prevent a drop in blood sugar reflects the body's sensitivity to insulin. The investigators will also give an IV drip of glucose and arginine (a building block of protein) 'tagged' with non-radioactive isotopes to better understand how glutamine may work. This procedure will be performed in 2 groups of 10 adolescents in the morning either after a strenuous exercise performed the previous afternoon (group 1; n=10), or after a sedentary day (group 2; n=10). Each subject will be studied twice, once after taking oral GLN, once after placebo, in separate clinical research center (CRC) admissions a few weeks apart, in random order.

Of particular importance, obese women have a higher risk of developing gestational diabetes and preeclampsia. In addition, obese women have larger offspring who have a higher risk for the development of obesity and diabetes; both largely attributed to higher maternal glycemia and glucose intolerance during pregnancy. Thus, identifying rehabilitative interventions that improve maternal and offspring metabolic and cardiovascular health in obese pregnancy are critical and have immediate and generational impact. Resistance and aerobic exercise training is a clinical staple for improving musculoskeletal, metabolic and cardiovascular health in non-gravid adolescents and adults with obesity however little is known regarding the effects of exercise during obese pregnancy. This study proposes to collect preliminary data on the independent effects of acute aerobic and resistance rehabilitative exercise on glucose metabolism and vascular function during pregnancy in n=15 obese women in order to inform a large, multisite clinical trial examining the acute and chronic effects of aerobic and resistance exercise on glucose metabolism and vascular function in normal weight, overweight and obese women during pregnancy.",YES,Pregnancy Complications|Obesity|Pre-Eclampsia|Gestational Diabetes,BEHAVIORAL: Resistance exercise|BEHAVIORAL: Aerobic Exercise|BEHAVIORAL: Rest,"Oral Glucose Insulin Sensitivity (OGIS) Index, Oral Glucose Insulin Sensitivity (OGIS) during a 2-hour oral glucose tolerance test.
