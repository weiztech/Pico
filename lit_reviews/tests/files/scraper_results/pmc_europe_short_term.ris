AB  - We report on a pure laparoscopic left lateral graft procurement with removing segment 3 that employs the Glissonean approach, indocyanine green (ICG) fluorescence imaging and in situ splitting. We first mobilised the liver and confirmed the root of the left hepatic vein (LHV). We then encircled the left Glissonean pedicle, and the segment 3 Glissonean pedicle (G3) was also individually encircled. We performed parenchymal transection of the left lateral segmentectomy using Pringle's manoeuvre. We clipped G3 and confirmed the demarcation line using ICG fluorescence imaging. The inflow in the S2 area was confirmed via intraoperative sonography, and we split segment 3 (S3) from the left lateral sector graft in situ. The left hepatic artery, left portal vein and left hepatic duct were also encircled and divided. The LHV was transected using a linear stapler, and the S2 monosegment liver graft and removed S3 were procured. Our technique reasonably prevents graft-related complications.

AB  - <h4>Background</h4>Recently, indocyanine green (ICG) fluorescence imaging has been increasingly used in laparoscopic anatomic liver resection. The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy of ICG-guided laparoscopic anatomic liver resection in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) compared with traditional laparoscopic anatomic liver resection.<h4>Methods</h4>A retrospective study was performed on patients with pathologically diagnosed HCC who successfully underwent laparoscopic anatomical liver resection from January 2019 to December 2021. The outcomes were compared between the two groups before and after the propensity score matching (PSM).<h4>Results</h4>A total of 110 patients were included in this study, including 50 patients in the ICG-guided group and 60 patients in the traditional group. Compared with the traditional group, the ICG-guided group had a shorter operative duration (P = 0.040), less intraoperative blood loss (P = 0.044), a lower incidence of postoperative complications (P = 0.023), and a shorter postoperative hospitalisation (P < 0.001). After PSM, significant differences remained between the two groups for the duration of postoperative hospitalisation (P = 0.018) and postoperative complications (P = 0.042). There was no significant difference in the recurrence rate between the two groups before and after PSM.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Laparoscopic anatomic liver resection guided by ICG fluorescence imaging can reduce the duration of postoperative hospitalisation for patients and the incidence of postoperative complications. However, it has no impact on the long-term outcome of patients.

AB  - Maintaining the postoperative quality of life (QOL) while ensuring curability without overtreatment is important in the treatment of early gastric cancer. Postoperative QOL is anticipated to be maintained through minimally invasive function-preserving gastrectomy in early gastric cancer. The concept of the sentinel lymph node (SN) basin is essential to maintain the curability of early gastric cancer using minimally invasive function-preserving gastrectomy. However, additional resection after surgery is difficult to perform in gastric cancer. Thus, the SN basin theory is important. Recently, a multicenter randomized phase III trial in South Korea (SENORITA trial) proved that laparoscopic sentinel node navigation surgery (LSNNS) for stomach preservation results in better postoperative QOL compared with standard gastrectomy in patients with early gastric cancer. LSNNS contributes to patients' QOL based on the concept that curability is not impaired. A multicenter nonrandomized phase III trial is ongoing in Japan, and oncologic safety is expected to be demonstrated. LSNNS has been established as a treatment option for selected patients with early gastric cancer, and its application will become widespread in the future.

AB  - <h4>Background</h4>Indocyanine green (ICG) fluorescence imaging technology is increasingly widely used in laparoscopic hepatectomy. However, whether it can provide long-term survival benefits to patients with liver malignancies remains unclear. This study investigated the clinical effect of laparoscopic hepatectomy for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) using ICG imaging technology.<h4>Methods</h4>We retrospectively analyzed HCC patients who underwent laparoscopic hepatectomy at Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University from January 2016 to December 2020. Propensity score matching (PSM) was used to match patients undergoing ICG fluorescence navigation laparoscopic hepatectomy (ICG-FNLH) with those undergoing conventional laparoscopic hepatectomy (CLH) in a 1:1 ratio to minimize the influence of confounding factors. We compared perioperative status and long-term prognosis between the two groups and performed multivariate analysis to identify risk factors associated with overall survival and recurrence-free survival.<h4>Results</h4>The original cohort consisted of 141 patients, with 50 patients in each group (100 patients in total) after PSM. The anatomical liver resection rate, R0 resection rate, and resection margin distance in the ICG-FNLH group were higher than those in the CLH group. The intraoperative blood loss was lower than that in the CLH group. The recurrence-free survival and overall survival of the ICG-FNLH group were better than those of the CLH group. ICG-FNLH improved the recurrence-free survival of HCC patients (hazard ratio [HR] = 2.165, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.136-4.127, P = 0.024).<h4>Conclusions</h4>Compared with CLH, ICG-FNLH can improve the recurrence-free survival rate of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma and may help to improve the long-term prognosis of patients.

AB  - Soft tissue sarcomas (STS) are rare malignant tumors often associated with poor outcomes and high local recurrence rates. Current tools for intraoperative and definitive margin assessment include intraoperative frozen section and permanent pathology, respectively. Indocyanine green dye (ICG) is a historically safe fluorophore dye that has demonstrated efficacy for intraoperative margin assessment in the surgical management of both breast and gastrointestinal cancers. The utility of ICG in the surgical management of sarcoma surgery has primarily been studied in pre-clinical mouse models and warrants further investigation as a potential adjunct to achieving negative margins. This study is a prospective, non-randomized clinical study conducted on patients with confirmed or suspected STS. Patients younger than 18 years, with a prior adverse reaction to iodine or fluorescein, or with renal disease were excluded from the study. Intravenous ICG was infused approximately three hours prior to surgery at a dosage of 2.0-2.5 mg/kg, and following tumor resection, the excised tumor and tumor bed were imaged for fluorescence intensity. When scanning the tumor bed, a threshold of 77% calibrated to the region of maximum intensity in the resected tumor was defined as a positive ICG margin, according to published protocols from the breast cancer literature. ICG results were then compared with the surgeon's clinical impression of margin status and permanent pathology results. Out of 26 subjects recruited for the original study, 18 soft tissue sarcomas (STS) were included for analysis. Three subjects were excluded for having bone sarcomas, and five subjects were excluded due to final pathology, which was ultimately inconsistent with sarcoma. The average age of patients was 64.1 years old (range: 28-83), with an average ICG dose of 201.8 mg. In 56% (10/18) of patients, ICG margins were consistent with the permanent pathology margins, with 89% specificity. The use of ICG as an intraoperative adjunct to obtaining negative margins in soft tissue sarcoma surgery is promising. However, studies with larger sample sizes are warranted to further delineate the accuracy, optimal dosage, timing, and types of sarcoma in which this diagnostic tool may be most useful.

AB  - Abstract <h4>Introduction</h4> No objective technique exists to distinguish necrotic from viable tissue, risking over-excision in burns and loss of wound healing potential. Using delayed fluorescence imaging of indocyanine green (ICG), a method called second window ICG (SWIG), we have shown that high dose ICG persists in burn wounds in both animals and patients 24 hours after infusion. The necrotic avidity of ICG is proposed as the underlying mechanism, although inflammation also likely has a role. The objective of this study is to examine the hypothesis at both the tissue and cellular levels. <h4>Methods</h4> To examine the localization of ICG in burn tissue, 4-mm biopsies taken from burn patients who underwent SWIG were embedded and sequentially sectioned for H&E (tissue architecture) and LDH (tissue viability) and ICG fluorescence imaging. To examine whether ICG preferentially binds to necrotic cells, primary skin cells (fibroblasts or keratinocytes) were subjected to thermal injury at 65ºC for 0 (untreated), 2.5 or 5 minutes. The cells were subsequently incubated with ICG at concentrations ranging from 0.5 to 5 μg/mL at 37ºC for 30 minutes. A necrosis and apoptosis detection kit with Yo-Pro™-1 and propidium iodide (PI) was used to differentiate live, apoptotic and necrotic cell populations in flow cytometry. The ICG florescence intensity of each cell population was measured with flow cytometry. <h4>Results</h4> The fluorescence microscopic imaging revealed that ICG intensity was most intense in the superficial severely thermally-injured tissue and gradually decreased with depth. This zone of high ICG intensity was co-localized with high cellularity (shown in H&E) consisting of a mixture of nonviable skin cells (shown in LDH) and inflammatory infiltrates. Using flow cytometry, the optimal concentration of ICG with the highest ICG florescence median intensity (FMI) and the best separation of live, apoptotic and necrotic cell populations was 2.5 μg/mL, which was used for subsequent flow cytometry experiments. For both fibroblasts and keratinocytes, the ICG FMI was significantly higher in the necrotic cell population than that of either the live or apoptotic cell population, suggesting higher affinity of ICG to necrotic cells. The ICG FMI of necrotic cells with longer heat exposure (5 minutes) was significantly higher than that of necrotic cells with shorter heat exposure (2.5 minutes), suggesting that the binding sites for ICG increase with the degree of thermal injury. <h4>Conclusions</h4> This study demonstrates the necrotic avidity of ICG in burned skin tissue and two primary skin cell types. Further studies are needed to study the ICG binding characteristics with inflammatory cell populations and single cell suspensions dissociated from human burn tissue. <h4>Applicability of Research to Practice</h4> This, along with our pilot study of SWIG in patients, supports the feasibility of SWIG in guiding surgical decision-making in burn excision by defining thresholds of fluorescence intensity values.

AB  - Injury to the right gastroepiploic artery (RGEA) graft during gastrectomy after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) can cause critical coronary failure. A man in his 60s with advanced gastric cancer and a history of CABG was admitted to our hospital. His cardiac blood flow was dependent on RGEA, and a gastrectomy with RGEA preservation was necessary. Robot-assisted distal gastrectomy with real-time vessel navigation using indocyanine green (ICG) fluorescence imaging and Da Vinci Firefly technology was planned. Intraperitoneal observation revealed severe adhesions around the graft. Two milliliters ICG (2.5 mg/mL) was injected intravenously, and RGEA was visualized. An RGEA-preserving robot-assisted distal gastrectomy was successfully performed. The operation time was 279 minutes, and the blood loss was 5 mL. The postoperative course was good and there were no complications.

AB  - <h4>Purpose</h4>Although numerous studies have highlighted the potential value of indocyanine green (ICG) imaging in lymph node dissection of cancer surgery, its efficacy and optimal method remain to be clarified. This study aimed to investigate how lymphatic flow observation via ICG fluorescence could contribute to colon cancer surgery.<h4>Methods</h4>From October 2018 to March 2021, a total of 56 patients with colon cancer who underwent laparoscopic complete mesocolic excision with intraoperative ICG imaging were analyzed. Lymphatic flow was examined at the following time points following ICG injection: within 5 min, 30-60 min, and over 60 min. We also evaluated the distribution of ICG fluorescence per each vascular pedicle.<h4>Results</h4>Lymphatic flow was observed within 5 min following ICG injection in 6 cases (10.7%), and at 30-60 min following ICG injection in 43 cases (76.8%). ICG-stained vascular pedicles were variable especially in hepatic flexural, transverse, and splenic flexural colon cancer. Lymph node metastases were observed in 14 cases. Although metastatic lymph nodes were present only in the area along the ICG-stained vascular pedicles in 12 of the 14 cases, two patients exhibited lymph node metastasis in areas along the ICG-unstained vascular pedicles. ICG fluorescence was observed outside the standard range of lymph node dissection in 9 cases (20.9%: 9/43). Although addition of the proposed resection areas was made in 8 of these 9 cases, there was no pathologically positive lymph node.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Real-time ICG fluorescence imaging of lymph nodes may improve the performance of laparoscopic colon cancer surgery, although its oncological benefit is not yet clear.

AB  - <h4>Background</h4>In Asia, particularly, robotic gastrectomy has grown in popularity as a treatment for stomach cancer. Indocyanine green (ICG) and near-infrared (NIR) fluorescent imaging technology has been reported for robotic gastrectomy. However, the clinical value still should be further evaluated. In this meta-analysis, we investigated the safety and efficacy of ICG near-infrared fluorescent imaging-guided lymph node (LN) dissection during robotic gastrectomy.<h4>Material and methods</h4>Through July 2022, systematic searches of PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library were conducted to find studies comparing ICG fluorescence imaging with conventional treatment in patients with gastric cancer. The current meta-analysis was performed according to the preferred reporting items for systematic review and meta-analysis guidelines. A pooled analysis was performed for the available data regarding the number of lymph node dissections, other operative outcomes and postoperative complications. R studio software 4.2.2 was used for this meta-analysis.<h4>Results</h4>This analysis includes five studies with a total of 312 gastric cancer patients (128 in the ICG group and 184 in the non-ICG group). In this meta-analysis, the number of retrieved LNs in the ICG group was significantly higher (weighted mean difference [WMD] = 8.80, 95% confidence intervals [CI]: 4.37-13.22, <i>p</i> < 0.05) than that in the non-ICG group with moderate heterogeneity (<i>p</i> < 0.0001, I<sup>2</sup>=53.3%). Intraoperative blood loss and postoperative complications were all comparable and without significant heterogeneity. Additionally, ICG near-infrared fluorescent imaging was associated with a reduced operative time (WMD= -11.85, 95% CI: -22.40 to -1.30, <i>p</i> < 0.05) with low heterogeneity (<i>p</i> = 0.027, I<sup>2</sup>= 2.1%).<h4>Conclusions</h4>ICG near-infrared fluorescent imaging-guided lymphadenectomy was considered to be safe and effective in robotic gastrectomy. ICG was used to increase the number of LNs harvested while reducing operative time without increasing intraoperative blood loss or postoperative complications.

AB  - Understanding the source and route of pelvic metastasis is essential to developing an optimal strategy for controlling local and systemic diseases of rectal cancer. This study aims to delineate the distribution of lymphatic channels and flow from the distal rectum. In fresh-frozen cadaveric hemipelvis specimens, the ligamentous attachment of the distal rectum to the pelvic floor muscles and the presacral fascia were evaluated. Using indocyanine green (ICG) fluorescence imaging, we simultaneously evaluated the gross anatomy of the lymphatic communication of the distal rectum. We also investigated the lymphatic flow in the pelvic cavity intraoperatively in rectal cancer patients who underwent radical rectal resection with total mesorectal excision (TME). In fresh cadavers, multiple small perforating lymphovascular branches exist in the retrorectal space, posteriorly connecting the mesorectum to the presacral fascia. The lymphatic flow from the distal rectum drains directly into the presacral space through the branches. In patients who underwent TME for rectal cancer, intraoperative ICG fluorescence signals were seen in the pelvic sidewalls and the presacral space. This anatomical study demonstrated that the lymphatic flow from the distal rectum runs directly to the pelvic lateral sidewalls and the presacral space, suggesting a possible route of metastasis in distal rectal cancer.

AB  - <h4>Background</h4>The use of lymph node (LN) tracers can help obtain a complete dissection of the lymph nodes and increase the detection rate of LNs and metastatic LNs. Carbon nanoparticle suspension injection (CNSI) and indocyanine green (ICG) have been widely used in radical gastrectomy in recent years. Nevertheless, the comparison of their clinical effects has not been studied.<h4>Method/design</h4>The FUTURE-01 trial will be the first randomized, open-label, single-center trial to compare CNSI and ICG. The study started in 2021 and enrolled 96 patients according to a prior sample size calculation. The primary outcome is the number of LNs retrieved. The secondary outcomes are LN staining rate, LN metastasis rate, stained LN metastasis rate, perioperative recovery and survival.<h4>Conclusion</h4>By comparing the safety and efficacy of CNSI and ICG tracer-guided LN dissection in patients with gastric cancer, we can determine the most appropriate LN tracer at present. With the help of LN tracers, the operation is simplified, and the prognosis of these patients is improved. Our study is a prospective exploration of the safety, efficacy, and prognosis of CNSI and ICG.<h4>Clinical trial registration</h4>https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT05229874?cond=NCT05229874&draw=2&rank=1, identifier NCT05229874.

AB  - Free tissue transfer has been frequently used in head and neck reconstruction. However, vascular problems still cause serious damage to patients when thromboses occur in microvascular anastomoses. In the Gemini anastomosis procedure, two flap pedicle veins are anastomosed adjacently to the internal jugular vein using the end-to-side anastomosis method. From April 2019 to March 2021, 12 patients whose free flaps had two pedicle veins underwent head and neck surgery in Saitama Cancer Center (Saitama, Japan). In six patients, the veins were anastomosed adjacently to the internal jugular vein using the Gemini procedure (Gemini group). In the other six patients, the veins were anastomosed to the internal jugular vein using the end-to-side anastomosis method at a distance from each other (control group). The anastomosis time was measured retrospectively by reviewing video from the operations and comparing them across groups. There were no reoperations in any patients, and all flaps survived without exhibiting any circulatory problems. The mean total anastomosis time in the Gemini group was 21 minutes 38 seconds ± 75 seconds. The mean total anastomosis time in the control group was 34 minutes 14 seconds ± 121 seconds. The mean flap ischemic time in the Gemini group was 124 minutes ± 3 minutes. The mean flap ischemic time in the control group was 135 minutes ± 6 minutes. The Gemini anastomosis procedure is effective and convenient when the pedicle has two veins and the recipient vein choice is only the internal jugular vein in head and neck reconstruction.

AB  - The lymphatic system is a complex network of lymphatic vessels, lymph nodes, and lymphoid organs. The current understanding of the basic mechanism and framework of the lymphatic system is relatively limited and not ideal for exploring the function of the lymphatic system, diagnosing lymphatic system diseases, and controlling tumor metastasis. Imaging modalities for evaluating lymphatic system diseases mainly include lymphatic angiography, reactive dye lymphatic angiography, radionuclide lymphatic angiography, computed tomography, and ultrasonography. However, these are insufficient for clinical diagnosis. Some novel imaging methods, such as magnetic resonance imaging, positron emission computed tomography, single-photon emission computed tomography, contrast-enhanced ultrasonography, and near-infrared imaging with agents such as cyanine dyes, can reveal lymphatic system information more accurately and in detail. We fabricated an albumin-based fluorescent probe for dual-modality imaging of the lymphatic system. A near-infrared cyanine dye, IR-780, was absorbed into bovine serum albumin (BSA), which was covalently linked to a molecule of diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid to chelate gadolinium Gd3+. The fabricated IR-780@BSA@Gd3+ nanocomposite demonstrates strong fluorescence and high near-infrared absorption and can be used as a T1 contrast agent for magnetic resonance imaging. <i>In vivo</i> dual-modality fluorescence and magnetic resonance imaging showed that IR-780@BSA@Gd3+ rapidly returned to the heart through the lymphatic circulation after it was injected into the toe webs of mice, facilitating good lymphatic imaging. The successful fabrication of the new IR-780@BSA@Gd3+ nanocomposite will facilitate the study of the mechanism and morphological structure of the lymphatic system.

AB  - Pulmonary metastases from hepatoblastoma (HB) have traditionally been identified by preoperative computed tomography scan image evaluation, and intraoperative visual and palpatory examinations through thoracotomy have been generally recommended. However, the safety and accuracy of surgery can be problematic in patients with small multiple lung metastases due to postoperative respiratory dysfunction risk secondary to decreased residual lung capacity in wedge resections. We present an 8-month-old patient with metastatic HB with multiple metachronous pulmonary lesions in whom thoracoscopic lung resections were performed guided by indocyanine green (ICG) administered intravenously 24 h earlier (0.5 mg/kg). ICG fluorescence allowed identification and limited resection of lung parenchyma, avoiding postoperative respiratory dysfunction. A total of 16 lung lesions were resected during four operations (two bilateral and two right thoracoscopies), with no postoperative complications. ICG-guided thoracoscopic surgery allowed identification and resection of metastatic nodules in both lungs during the same procedure, achieving a hospital stay of less than 3 days for each intervention. The patient is currently 24 months old and remains asymptomatic, with no distant disease at the last imaging control. ICG-guided resection via a thoracoscopic approach is particularly useful in patients with multiple and/or metachronous metastases requiring multiple surgical interventions.

AB  - Laparoscopic liver resection has become a standard practice in many surgical wards in elective liver surgery, due to its positive impact on reducing hospital stay and postoperative complications, including lower blood loss and transfusion rate. However, achieving proper hemostasis in liver surgery, due to its vast blood supply, still remains a main concern to surgeons. Therefore, numerous techniques were and are still being developed to further reduce blood loss and transfusion rate. The aim of this literature review was to summarize the best available methods for achieving the minimal blood loss and transfusion rate in laparoscopic liver surgery, according to the newest data.

AB  - Necrotizing soft-tissue infections (NSTIs) are aggressive and deadly. Immediate surgical debridement is standard-of-care, but patients often present with non-specific symptoms, thereby delaying treatment. Because NSTIs cause microvascular thrombosis, we hypothesized that perfusion imaging using indocyanine green (ICG) would show diminished fluorescence signal in NSTI-affected tissues, particularly compared to non-necrotizing, superficial infections. Through a first-in-kind clinical study, we performed first-pass ICG fluorescence perfusion imaging of patients with suspected NSTIs. Early results support our hypothesis that ICG signal voids occur in NSTI-affected tissues and that dynamic contrast-enhanced fluorescence parameters reveal tissue kinetics that may be related to disease progression and extent.

AB  - Abstract <h4>Introduction</h4> Functional arterial blood pressure waveform (ABW) features are incompletely understood in the context of burn injury and resuscitation. In this work, we analyzed the variability of pulse pressure (PPV), systolic pressure (SPV), stroke volume (SVV), and five measures of heart rate variability (HRV) in time and frequency domains as potential indicators of burn resuscitation adequacy in a large total body surface area (TBSA) porcine model with varying degrees of intravenous fluids. <h4>Methods</h4> Data were collected from 21 anesthetized and mechanically-ventilated pigs (32±4 kg weight, 40% TBSA), which were instrumented for continuous hemodynamic monitoring for 24 hours. Urinary output (UO), hematocrit (HCT) and cardiac output (CO) were also measured at various time points. The animals were divided into Paradigm 1 (P1): no resuscitation (N=7); Paradigm 2 (P2): fluid titration to UO (N=8); and Paradigm 3 (P3): deliberate over-resuscitation with consistent high fluid rates (N=6). We calculated PPV, SPV, SVV, and five widely used HRV measures: normalized low-frequency power (NLF), high-frequency power (NHF), very-low-frequency power (VLF), low-frequency-high-frequency (LFHF) ratio, and the root-mean-squared of the duration difference in consecutive beats (RR-RMS). All features were averaged on an hourly basis and their potential in tracking reference CO and SV was investigated via linear regression and correlation analysis after calibrating the data to SV and CO on an individual basis. <h4>Results</h4> PPV, SPV, SVV, and RR-RMSE showed statistically distinguishable trends for different paradigms, as depicted in Figure 1, along with averaged trends for lab measurement. PPV, SPV, and SVV tracked the CO the best and were comparable to UO, however, SVV was far superior in tracking SV. A regression analysis between these four features and UO showed a very low level of agreement despite comparable tracking of SV and CO. HRV measures did not distinguish resuscitation paradigms and were inferior in tracking CO and similar in tracking SV to aforesaid features. <h4>Conclusions</h4> PPV, SPV, SVV, and RR-RMSE may potentially complement UO in the hemodynamic assessment of the burn patients and outperform other HRV measures in general. Future work will optimize the extraction of strategic informative features of ABW analysis in the various fluid status states post-burn injury. <h4>Applicability of Research to Practice</h4> Titrating burn resuscitation rates to have protocols including PPV, SPV, SVV, and RR-RMSE alongside other standard metrics may offer precision medicine strategies to fine-tune IV fluid rates.

AB  - <h4>Objective</h4>This study aimed to investigate the feasibility of using indocyanine green (ICG) near-infrared (NIR) imaging during lymphadenectomy for oesophageal cancer.<h4>Methods</h4>Eighty-seven patients with primary oesophageal cancer were enrolled in this study. All the enrolled patients received an endoscopic injection of ICG between 40 min and 23 h before surgery. Nodal dissection during surgery was performed under fluorescence imaging visualisation, with the NIR signal shown in purple. ICG<sup>+</sup> or ICG<sup>-</sup> nodes were recorded station by station and were microscopically evaluated.<h4>Results</h4>Endoscopic peritumoral ICG injection was successfully performed in all patients. Major post-surgery complications included wound infection, pleural effusion, dysphonia, pneumonia and anastomotic fistula. No patients experienced ICG-related adverse events. A total of 2,584 lymph nodes were removed, and the mean number of lymph nodes for each patient was 29.70 ± 9.24. Most of the removed nodes (97.83%) were ICG<sup>+</sup>, and 3.32% of the ICG<sup>+</sup> nodes were metastatic. No metastatic nodes were ICG<sup>-</sup> or belonged to an ICG<sup>-</sup> lymph node station. The time from ICG injection to surgery did not affect the number of harvested lymph nodes.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The use of ICG-NIR imaging during oesophageal cancer surgery can enhance the visualisation of lymph nodes during surgery. It is a feasible, safe and helpful technique for lymphadenectomy.

AB  - This study aimed to compare the results of free MS-TRAM and DIEP-flap based on the volume of the transplant and the unique characteristics of blood flow in the tissues. The study included 83 patients, 42 in the MS-TRAM-flap reconstruction group and 41 in the DIEP-flap breast reconstruction group. In the MS-TRAM-flap group, 35 patients received delayed reconstruction, and 7 received one-stage breast reconstruction, including one case of bilateral transplantation. In the DIEP-flap group, 5 patients received one-stage reconstruction, and 36 received delayed reconstruction. Complications associated with the flap tissue were observed in 7 (16.67%) in the MS-TRAM-flap group and 8 (19.51%) cases in the DIEP-flap group. The total level of fat necrosis in MS-TRAM-flap was 7.14% (p=0.033), and in DIEP-flap, it was 9.75% (p=0.039) (2 patients had a substantial amount of fat necrosis, while 2 patients had a modest amount of focal fat necrosis). The number and diameter of perforators (including veins), as well as the transplant volume, are the primary determinants of whether to use a DIEP- or MS-TRAM-flap. DIEP-flap is preferred if there are 1-2 large artery perforators (≥1 mm) and tissue volume of 700-800 grams, while MS-TRAM-flap is used when the tissue volume is significant (>2/3 of standard TRAM-flap).

AB  - Abstract <h4>Introduction</h4> Our clinical research unveiled chronic heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) as a long-term sequel in survivors of severe pediatric burn injury due to a yet unknown molecular pathomechanism. Applying a standardized rat model, we systematically determined the pathophysiological impact of burn injury on long-term cardiac performance to uncover systemic and molecular pathomechanisms that may cause post-burn HFpEF development. <h4>Methods</h4> Male adolescent SD-rats were subjected to a 60 % total body surface area (TBSA) full-thickness burn- or sham-trauma and subsequently characterized after burn-injury by serial transthoracic echocardiography, bulk myocardial next-generation sequencing and proteomics as well as RT-PCR, immuno-blotting (IB), histology and plasma proteomics for cardiac performance and molecular alterations, respectively, at 3, 7, 30 and 90days. <h4>Results</h4> In comparison to the sham-group (SG), animals from the burn-group (BG) recapitulated typical post-burn clinical traits, such as significant loss in body weight (BG 27 % less than SG at 30d, p< 0.05) or skeletal muscle wasting (27 % less at 30d, p< 0.05) in accord with elevated molecular atrophy markers. We show post-burn cardiac muscle wasting (BG 22 % less at 30d, p< 0.05) and persistent markers of cardiac dysfunction in accord with significant histological cardiomyocyte hypotrophy (BG -8 % at 30d, p< 0.05) and significantly diminished left ventricular (LV) global longitudinal strain and isovolumic relaxation time in BGs, while LV-EF remained unchanged. Weighted gene network correlation analysis from bulk myocardial NGS and clinical traits related activation of immunological and pro-fibrotic pathways in post-burn injury hearts to cardiac dysfunction in BGs. Subsequent RT-PCR and histology confirmed significant myocardial accumulation of cardio-depressive damage associated molecular patterns (i.e., S100A8 and A9) and infiltration by granulocytes and monocytes as well as significant LV fibrosis. Serial plasma proteomic analysis indicated elevated plasma levels of S100A8 and A9 and other heart failure markers that mirrored similar changes in human post-burn plasma samples. <h4>Conclusions</h4> Here we report the development of HFpEF as a novel systemic consequence of severe burn injury in a rodent model, which warrants further mechanistic and translational studies. Cardiac inflammation and fibrosis are known to negatively impact cardiac performance and may be mechanistic key findings that will guide further therapeutic studies and subsequent validation of post-burn heart failure biomarkers <h4>Applicability of Research to Practice</h4> This model is part of a translational and interdisciplinary experimental and clinical effort to inform pathophysiology and mechanistics of long-term heart failure in burn patients. Echocardiographic data and parameters from this model are currently being used to evaluate adult survivors of severe burn injury for signs of HFpEF.

AB  - <h4>Background</h4>Securing sufficient blood perfusion to the anastomotic area after low-anterior resection is a crucial factor in preventing anastomotic leakage (AL). Intra-operative indocyanine green fluorescent imaging (ICG-FI) has been suggested as a tool to assess perfusion. However, knowledge of inter-observer variation among surgeons in the interpretation of ICG-FI is sparse. Our primary objective was to evaluate inter-observer variation among surgeons in the interpretation of bowel blood-perfusion assessed visually by ICG-FI. Our secondary objective was to compare the results both from the visual assessment of ICG and from computer-based quantitative analyses of ICG-FI between patients with and without the development of AL.<h4>Method</h4>A multicenter study, including patients undergoing robot-assisted low anterior resection with stapled anastomosis. ICG-FI was evaluated visually by the surgeon intra-operatively. Postoperatively, recorded videos were anonymized and exchanged between centers for inter-observer evaluation. Time to visibility (TTV), time to maximum visibility (TMV), and time to wash-out (TWO) were visually assessed. In addition, the ICG-FI video-recordings were analyzed using validated pixel analysis software to quantify blood perfusion.<h4>Results</h4>Fifty-five patients were included, and five developed clinical AL. Bland-Altman plots (BA plots) demonstrated wide inter-observer variation for visually assessed fluorescence on all parameters (TTV, TMV, and TWO). Comparing leak-group with no-leak group, we found no significant differences for TTV: Hazard Ratio; HR = 0.82 (CI 0.32; 2.08), TMV: HR = 0.62 (CI 0.24; 1.59), or TWO: HR = 1.11 (CI 0.40; 3.11). In the quantitative pixel analysis, a lower slope of the fluorescence time-curve was found in patients with a subsequent leak: median 0.08 (0.07;0.10) compared with non-leak patients: median 0.13 (0.10;0.17) (p = 0.04).<h4>Conclusion</h4>The surgeon's visual assessment of the ICG-FI demonstrated wide inter-observer variation, there were no differences between patients with and without AL. However, quantitative pixel analysis showed a significant difference between groups.<h4>Trial registration</h4>ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04766060.

AB  - Indocyanine green (ICG) is one of the only clinically approved near-infrared (NIR) fluorophores used during fluorescence-guided surgery (FGS), but it lacks tumor specificity for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Several tumor-targeted fluorescent probes have been evaluated in PDAC patients, yet no uniformity or consensus exists among the surgical community on the current and future needs of FGS during PDAC surgery. In this first-published consensus report on FGS for PDAC, expert opinions were gathered on current use and future recommendations from surgeons' perspectives. A Delphi survey was conducted among international FGS experts via Google Forms. Experts were asked to anonymously vote on 76 statements, with ≥70% agreement considered consensus and ≥80% participation/statement considered vote robustness. Consensus was reached for 61/76 statements. All statements were considered robust. All experts agreed that FGS is safe with few drawbacks during PDAC surgery, but that it should not yet be implemented routinely for tumor identification due to a lack of PDAC-specific NIR tracers and insufficient evidence proving FGS's benefit over standard methods. However, aside from tumor imaging, surgeons suggest they would benefit from visualizing vasculature and surrounding anatomy with ICG during PDAC surgery. Future research could also benefit from identifying neuroendocrine tumors. More research focusing on standardization and combining tumor identification and vital-structure imaging would greatly improve FGS's use during PDAC surgery.
