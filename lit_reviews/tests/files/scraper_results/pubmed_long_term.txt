TI  - Review of robot-assisted laparoscopic surgery in management of infant congenital 
      urology: Advances and limitations in utilization and learning.

AB  - As robotic-assisted (RAL) surgery expanded to treat pediatric congenital disease, 
      infant anatomy and physiology posed unique challenges that prompted adaptations 
      to the technology and surgical technique, which are compiled and reviewed in this 
      manuscript. From the beginning, collaboration with anesthesia is critical for a 
      safe, efficient case including placement of an endotracheal tube rather than a 
      laryngeal mask (LMA) and placement of a nasogastric tube and/or rectal tube to 
      relieve distended stomach or bowel, respectively. Furthermore, end-tidal CO(2) 
      (EtCO(2) ) is important for monitoring and predicting the effects of 
      pneumoperitoneum on caridiovascular physiology, incranial pressure, and risk of 
      acidosis and hypercarbia. Positioning can further exacerbate these effects and 
      affect intra-abdominal working space. For infant robotic pyeloplasty and 
      heminephrectomy, a "beanbag" is commonly used for stabilization in the lateral 
      decubitus position. We advise against the use of a "baby bump" because it brings 
      the bowels and vasculature more anterior than expected. Pnuemoperitoneum pressure 
      of 8-10 mmHg during port placement maximizes safety, but thereafter, the 
      pneumoperitoneum pressure can be minimized to 6-8 mmHg during the procedure 
      without compromising the visual field. Port sites should be marked after 
      insufflation, followed by the open Hasson technique for peritoneal access and 
      port placement under direct vision with intussusception of the trocars to avoid 
      vascular or bowel injury. Additional tips can be obtained through this 
      manuscript, immersive fellowships, and mini-fellowships. Ulitmately, infant 
      robotic surgery has the potential to benefit many children but is presently 
      limited by the lack of pediatric-specific robotic technology and its associated 
      costs.

TI  - Pyeloplasty with ureteral stent placement in children: Do prophylactic 
      antibiotics serve a purpose?
PG  - 804-811
LID - S1477-5131(22)00119-X [pii]

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Ureteral stents are commonly used during pyeloplasty to ensure 
      drainage and anastomotic healing. Antibiotic prophylaxis is often used due to 
      concerns for urinary tract infection (UTI). Although many surgeons prescribe 
      prophylactic antibiotics following pyeloplasty, practices vary widely due to lack 
      of clear evidence-based guidelines. We hypothesize that the rate of stent UTI 
      does not significantly vary between children who receive antibiotics and those 
      who do not. METHODS: We reviewed the medical records of 741 patients undergoing 
      pyeloplasty between January 2010 and July 2018 across seven institutions. 
      Exclusion criteria were: age older than 22 years, no stent placed, externalized 
      stents used, and incomplete records. Surgical approach, age, antibiotic use, 
      stent duration, Foley duration, and urine culture results were recorded. Patients 
      were categorized into two groups, those younger than four years of age and those 
      four years and older as proxy for likely diaper use. Univariate logistic 
      regression was conducted to identify variables associated with UTI. Multivariable 
      backward stepwise logistic regression was used to identify the best model with 
      Akaike information criterion as model selection criteria. The selected model was 
      used to calculate odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals summarizing the 
      association between prophylactic antibiotics and stent UTI while controlling for 
      age, gender, and intra-operative urine cultures. RESULTS: 672 patients were 
      included; 338 received antibiotic prophylaxis and 334 did not. These groups 
      differed in mean age (3.91 vs. 6.91 years, P < .001), mean stent duration (38.5 
      vs. 35.32 days, P < .001), and surgical approach (53.25% vs. 32.04% open vs. 
      laparoscopic, P < .001). The incidence of stent UTI was low overall (7.59%) and 
      similar in both groups: 31/338 (9.17%) in the prophylaxis group and 20/334 
      (5.99%) in the non-prophylaxis group (P = .119). Although female gender, likely 
      diaper use, and positive intra-operative urine culture were each associated with 
      significantly higher odds of stent UTI, prophylactic antibiotic use was not 
      associated with significant reduction in stent UTI in any of these groups. 
      Surgical approach, stent duration, and Foley duration were not associated with 
      stent UTI. CONCLUSION: Incidence of stent UTI is low overall following 
      pyeloplasty. Prophylactic antibiotics are not associated with lower rates of 
      stent UTI following pyeloplasty even after controlling for risk factors of female 
      gender, likely diaper use, and positive intra-operative urine culture. Routine 
      administration of prophylactic antibiotics after pyeloplasty does not appear to 
      be beneficial, and may be best reserved for those with multiple risk factors for 
      UTI.

TI  - Applications of Indocyanine Green-Guided Near-Infrared Fluorescence Imaging in 
      Pediatric Minimally Invasive Surgery Urology: A Narrative Review.
PG  - 1280-1287
LID - 10.1089/lap.2022.0231 [doi]
AB  - Background: Indocyanine green (ICG) is a fluorescent dye used for several 
      indications in adult surgery, and, more recently, adopted also in the pediatric 
      patients. This study aimed to review the literature published on the use of ICG 
      near-infrared fluorescence (NIRF) in pediatric urology, to address its 
      shortcomings and disadvantages and to detect the future perspectives. Materials 
      and Methods: An electronic literature search of PubMed on all studies reporting 
      use of ICG-NIRF in pediatrics was performed. We included only studies reporting 
      ICG-NIRF application in minimally invasive surgery (MIS) for pediatric urology 
      indications. Results: Forty-two articles reporting MIS procedures performed using 
      ICG-NIRF in children were obtained, but only 15 studies that focused on 
      urological applications of ICG-NIRF in children were included in this review. The 
      included studies described use of ICG-NIRF for kidney malformations such as 
      duplex system, kidney tumors, renal cysts, ureteral pathology, bladder 
      malformations, varicocele, and lymph node sampling in tumors. The pediatric 
      urological applications in which ICG-NIRF provided significant advantages 
      included partial nephrectomy, lymphatics sparing varicocele repair, and 
      oncological procedures. The ICG-NIRF use was clinically safe, without reported 
      adverse systemic reactions in all pediatric series. The main drawback of this 
      technology is the need of specific laparoscopic equipment such as camera system, 
      light sources, and telescopes or the da Vinci Xi Robot, with the software for 
      ICG-NIRF, Firefly(®), already integrated within. Conclusions: ICG-enhanced 
      fluorescence-guided surgery is gaining growing popularity among pediatric 
      surgeons due to the excellent results that have been published until now. 
      ICG-NIRF technology has proven to be safe, easy to use, not time-consuming, 
      cheap, and very effective to improve intraoperative view and surgical ability. 
      Nonetheless, further evidence, including larger series, longer follow-up, and 
      more specific assessments, is necessary to confirm the preliminary results and 
      enlarge the applications.

TI  - Efficacy of robot-assisted hepaticojejunostomy and laparoscopic-assisted 
      hepaticojejunostomy in pediatric congenital choledochal dilatation: a system 
      review and meta-analysis.
PG  - 46
LID - 10.1007/s00383-022-05286-w [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The efficacy of robot-assisted hepaticojejunostomy (RAHJ) and 
      laparoscopic-assisted hepaticojejunostomy (LAHJ) in children with congenital 
      choledochal dilatation has been a topic of much debate and controversy. The 
      purpose of this study was to evaluate the role of RAHJ and LAHJ in pediatric 
      congenital choledochal dilatation. METHOD: The review program has been 
      prospectively registered (PROSPEROID: CRD42022306868). We searched the PubMed, 
      Embase, Cochrane, CBM, VIP, Web of Science, CNKI databases, and Wanfang databases 
      from March 2021. The Mantel-Haenszel method and a random-effects model were used 
      to figure out the hazard ratio (95% CI). RESULTS: Ten studies evaluated eight 
      hundred and sixty-nine subjects (three hundred and thirty-two in the robotic 
      group and five hundred and thirty-seven in the laparoscopic group), meeting all 
      inclusion criteria. Compared with the laparoscopic group, robotic group 
      demonstrated fewer postoperative complications [p = 0.0009; OR = 0.34 (95% CI, 
      0.18-0.64); I(2) = 3%], shorter postoperative hospital stay [p < 00,001; 
      MD = - 2.05 (95% CI, - 2.40-1.70); I(2) = 0%], and less intraoperative bleeding 
      [p = 0.008; MD = - 10.80 (95% CI, - 18.80-2.81); I(2) = 99%]. There was no 
      significant difference in operative time between the two groups [p = 0.10; 
      MD = 24.53 (95% CI, - 5.11-54.17); I(2) = 99%]. The same situation happened in 
      short-term complication outcomes [p = 0.06; RR = 0.45 (95% CI, 0.19-1.04); 
      I(2) = 0%]. However, children in the RAHJ group had significantly lower levels of 
      long-term complications [p = 0.04; OR = 0.41 (95% CI, 0.17-0.96); I(2) = 0%]. 
      Hospitalization costs were significantly higher in the RAHJ group [p < 0.00001; 
      OR = 27,113.86 (95% CI, 26,307.24-27,920.48); I(2) = 0%]. For overall 
      complications, subgroup analysis of literature published after 2020 and of 
      literature with high quality scores showed a significant decrease in the RAHJ 
      group. CONCLUSION: In children with congenital choledochal dilatation, RAHJ is 
      associated with reduced intraoperative bleeding, postoperative complications, and 
      length of stay. Robotic surgery has a bright future in the treatment of pediatric 
      common hepatic duct cysts and deserves to be promoted and popularized.
