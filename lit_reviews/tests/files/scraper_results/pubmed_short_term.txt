TI  - Ergonomic Considerations in Urologic Surgery.
PG  - 143-155
LID - 10.1007/s11934-022-01142-5 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This paper aims to discuss the various work-related 
      musculoskeletal disorders (WRMDs) among urologists and provide an overview of the 
      latest recommendations to improve awareness of ergonomic principles that can be 
      applied in the operating room, with special consideration of challenges faced 
      during pregnancy. RECENT FINDINGS: Urologists suffer from a large burden of 
      WRMDs. The main drivers of pain associated with the various surgical approaches 
      include repetitive movements, static and awkward body positions, and the use of 
      burdensome equipment. Pregnant surgeons are at an even greater risk of WRMDs and 
      face high rates of pregnancy complications. Laparoscopy, endoscopy, 
      robot-assisted surgeries, and open surgeries present unique ergonomic challenges 
      for the practicing urologist. Proper posture and equipment use, optimal operating 
      room setup, intraoperative stretching breaks, and an emphasis on teaching 
      ergonomic principles can reduce the risk of WRMDs. Surgeons are also at increased 
      risk of WRMDs during pregnancy but may continue to operate while taking measures 
      to limit physical exertion and fatigue. Improving awareness of and incorporating 
      ergonomic principles early in a urologist's career may reduce the risk of injury 
      and improve operative performance and longevity.

TI  - Three Centuries of Appendicectomy.
PG  - 928-936
LID - 10.1007/s00268-022-06874-6 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Save for the contribution of Charles McBurney, who described his 
      eponymous point and the appendicectomy incision, the history of appendicectomy is 
      largely unknown among the medical profession. This review traces the history from 
      the first anatomical depiction of the appendix to the development of open 
      appendicectomy and the recent minimally invasive and non-operative methods. 
      METHODS: Historical articles, monographs and books containing anatomical 
      descriptions of the vermiform appendix and reports of appendicitis and its 
      surgical treatment were retrieved after searching the PubMed, Google Scholar and 
      Embase databases from their inception to 31 March 2022. RESULTS: The first 
      inadvertent appendicectomy was performed during an operation for a groin hernia 
      by Cookesley in 1731, and Mestivier was the first to drain a right iliac fossa 
      abscess, due to appendicitis, in 1757. Krönlein performed the first 
      appendicectomy for acute appendicitis in 1884 but his patient died. The first 
      successful appendicectomy for acute appendicitis leading to patient survival was 
      by Morton in 1887. In 1976, Wirschafter and Kaufman performed an inadvertent 
      colonoscopic appendicectomy and, in 1980, Semm carried out the first laparoscopic 
      appendicectomy. The first appendicectomy via a natural orifice (transgastric) 
      appendicectomy was by Rao and Reddy in 2004. CONCLUSION: This historical review 
      charts the development of surgical knowledge concerning the management of 
      appendicitis, from the first anatomical drawings of the appendix and descriptions 
      of appendicitis to the development of surgical and conservative treatments up to 
      the present day. It also corrects some inaccuracies of attribution in previous 
      historical reviews.

TI  - The Correlation between Chronic Endometritis and Tubal-Factor Infertility.
LID - 10.3390/jcm12010285 [doi]
LID - 285
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To identify the prevalence and risk factors for chronic endometritis 
      (CE) with tubal factors and the correlation between chronic endometritis and 
      tubal factors among infertile populations. METHOD: A total of 52 patients with 
      chronic endometritis (CE group) who underwent laparoscopy and hysteroscopic 
      surgery were recruited between July 2020 and December 2021. A total of 38 
      patients without chronic endometritis (non-CE group) were included as a control. 
      Patients with endometriosis and intra-uterine abnormalities were excluded. 
      Endometrial samples were collected during surgery for CD138 immunohistochemistry 
      staining for the diagnosis of CE. Preoperative information (including age, 
      reproductive health characteristics, previous medical and surgical history), 
      intra-operative information (including the patency of the fallopian tube, the 
      presence of hydrosalpinx, score and the grade of tubal lesion condition) and 
      post-operative information (counts of CD138-positive HPF in the endometrial 
      specimen) were collected. RESULT: A multivariate analysis revealed that tubal 
      factors with unilateral or bilateral occlusion were significantly higher in the 
      CE group (OR 3.066, 95% CI 1.020-9.213, p = 0.046). The bilateral occlusion of 
      fallopian tubes (OR 8.785, 95% CI 1.408-54.818, p = 0.020) rather than unilateral 
      occlusion (OR 2.860, 95% CI 0.893-9.162, p = 0.077) was significantly associated 
      with chronic endometritis. The presence of a hydrosalpinx on one side (OR 7.842, 
      95% CI 1.279-48.086, p = 0.026) or both sides (OR 9.450, 95% CI 1.037-86.148, p = 
      0.046) was significantly associated with chronic endometritis. The comparison of 
      CD138-positive HPF counts among the tubal occlusion patients without 
      hydrosalpinx, patients with unilateral hydrosalpinx and patients with bilateral 
      hydrosalpinx were as follows: 1 HPF (50.00% vs. 12.50% vs. 11.11%, p = 0.051), 2 
      HPF (38.89% vs. 25.00% vs. 22.22%, p = 0.615), ≥3 HPF (11.11% vs. 62.50% vs. 
      66.67%, p = 0.005). The stage of tubal condition was positively correlated with 
      CD138-positive HPF counts in women with chronic endometritis (r = 0.460, p = 
      0.001). CONCLUSION: CE was closely related to the blockage of fallopian tubes and 
      hydrosalpinx. The severity degree of the fallopian lesion condition was 
      associated with inflammation of the endometrium.

AB  - Robotic surgical systems are now an inherent part of the German hospital 
      landscape. In recent years, there has been an enormous increase in installed 
      systems and operations performed, especially in abdominal surgery. Even though 
      there is a lack of studies with the highest grade of evidence, the advantages of 
      the technique are obvious-particularly technically demanding operations can now 
      be performed safely and less invasively for patients. Robotics are now being 
      implemented in many non-university institutions. At the Israelite Hospital 
      (Israelitisches Krankenhaus) Hamburg it could be demonstrated that with 
      systematic and modular training, i.e. execution of certain surgical steps, it is 
      possible to significantly flatten the learning curve while maintaining excellent 
      oncological quality, postoperative morbidity and mortality. The costs to have 
      a system up and running are the main limitations for the implementation of 
      robotic surgery. The acquisition, material and maintenance costs are substantial 
      so that the type of intervention and the training of prospective surgeons are 
      limited by the costs. The robotic approach will fully unroll its disruptive 
      character compared to laparoscopy once it is competitive not only qualitatively 
      in the field of medical contents but also economically. In the future the ROBIN 
      working group of the German Society for General and Visceral Surgery (DGAV) wants 
      to create the basic prerequisites for valid studies by working with registers and 
      could act as an independent central intermediary between hospitals and the 
      industry to promote practical innovations and systematic training for surgeons.

AB  - Gastric cancer still remains a major cause of cancer-related deaths globally. 
      Stage-adapted, individualized treatment is crucial to achieving optimal 
      oncological outcomes. Postoperative morbidity and accurate nodal staging are 
      heavily influenced by the extent of lymph node dissection. On one hand, 
      insufficient lymphadenectomy may result in understaging and undertreatment of a 
      patient, on the other hand, unnecessary lymph node dissection may result in a 
      higher rate of postoperative complications. Approximately one-third of patients 
      with gastric cancer undergoes an avoidable lymph node dissection. Many of the 
      recent treatment updates in the management of gastric cancer have a major 
      influence on both surgical and oncological approaches. Currently, a wide range of 
      endoscopic, minimally invasive, and hybrid surgical techniques are available. The 
      concept of sentinel node biopsy and utilization of the Maruyama Computer Program 
      are significant components of stage-adapted gastric cancer surgery. Likewise, 
      centralization and application of national guidelines, widespread use of 
      neoadjuvant therapy, and the stage migration phenomenon are serious concerns to 
      be discussed. Our goal is to review the available surgical strategies for gastric 
      cancer, with a primary focus on lymphadenectomy.

AB  - A 57-year-old woman, gravida 3, para 3, with no complaints visited our hospital 
      for right-sided adnexal tumor found incidentally in cancer screening. She had no 
      medical history, surgical history, or gynecological disease. Imaging studies 
      showed a 5-cm lobular cystic tumor on the right side of uterus. We suspected 
      right hydrosalpinx and decided to perform diagnostic laparoscopy. During 
      laparoscopy, the right adnexa was found to be atrophic, and the tumor was located 
      in the broad ligament. The tumor was observed to be a multilocular cyst 
      containing yellow fluid that developed from the right parauterine tissue. The 
      tumor was resected from the surrounding tissue. Histological examination revealed 
      that the multilocular cyst contained a vascular component surrounding the 
      lymphatic endothelium and was decided to be a cystic lymphangioma. The patient 
      was followed up and there was no evidence of recurrence at postoperative 
      7 months. We experienced a very rare case of lymphangioma arising from the 
      parauterine tissue. The laparoscopic approach can assist with both diagnosis and 
      treatment.

TI  - Learning laparoscopic hysterectomy: analysis of different surgeons' individual 
      learning curves.
PG  - 1065-1072
LID - 10.1007/s00404-022-06893-7 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to examine the development of surgical 
      skills among surgeons learning total laparoscopic hysterectomy (TLH), using 
      differences in complication rates between surgeons with different levels of 
      experience and analyzing the development of individual operating times. STUDY 
      DESIGN: This retrospective, single-center cohort study included 576 total 
      laparoscopic hysterectomy procedures conducted between January 2015 and December 
      2019 at the municipal hospital in Karlsruhe, Germany. All TLHs were performed by 
      eight surgeons, two of whom were experienced and six inexperienced. Complications 
      were graded using the Clavien-Dindo classification. RESULTS: No differences in 
      complication rates were seen between experienced and inexperienced surgeons. With 
      growing numbers of procedures, most surgeons quickly became faster, leading to 
      reduced operating times. However, experienced surgeons who had performed more 
      than 100 procedures also became faster, not reaching a time plateau after 
      adjustment for weight of the uterus, presurgery score, and adnexal score. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Learning laparoscopic hysterectomy in routine practice is safe for 
      patients, and surgeons rapidly become faster as growing numbers of procedures are 
      performed. Operating times for experienced surgeons who have carried out more 
      than 100 operations also improve, and a time plateau is not reached.

AB  - Navigation surgery using indocyanine green (ICG) fluorescence imaging has been 
      used in thoracoabdominal surgery, and its usefulness has been reported in many 
      cases. In this study, laparoscopic lateral lymph node dissection was performed 
      using ICG fluorescence imaging in a patient with left femoral spinous cell 
      carcinoma with inguinal and external iliac lymph node metastases. Spinous cell 
      carcinoma is classified as a rare cancer in Japan, and there is a scarcity of 
      evidence for pelvic lymph node dissection, as well as a lack of studies that 
      mention the dissection area. We hypothesized that visualization of lymph nodes 
      and lymph flow using intraoperative ICG fluorescence imaging would indicate the 
      area of dissection and lead to more efficient dissection. In conclusion, 
      intraoperative ICG fluorescence imaging may be useful in this area where there is 
      limited evidence, although there are some limitations.

TI  - Women's Perception of Transgastric and Transvaginal Natural Orifice Transluminal 
      Endoscopic Surgery (NOTES) - Impact of Medical Education, Stage of Life and 
      Cross-Cultural Aspects.
PG  - 1881-1895
LID - 10.2147/IJWH.S382457 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Despite that NOTES produces at least matchable clinical long-term 
      results when compared to laparoscopy, still a restraint within the medical 
      community and among patients is evident. Consequently, it might be meaningful to 
      evaluate factors of patient's NOTES perception to promote its acceptance. NOTES 
      is still quite novel and questionnaires regarding its perception by the public is 
      still lacking even so in the Middle East. Aim of our survey is to investigate the 
      viewpoint of female healthcare staff on NOTES. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 
      350 questionnaires along with written information about Minimally Invasive 
      Surgery and NOTES were distributed among the female staff in a Tertiary-care 
      Hospital in Abu Dhabi, 257 were returned completely anonymously and voluntarily 
      and entered into a database with a response rate of 73%. We surveyed factors like 
      religion, medical background, age as well as history of previous laparoscopy, 
      endoscopy, birth and other aspects that may impact a woman's perception of both 
      transgastric and transvaginal NOTES for cholecystectomy and ovariectomy, 
      respectively. RESULTS: Univariate analyses revealed the majority of Muslim women 
      to be more receptive to NOTES as a choice of surgical technique for 
      cholecystectomy and for ovariectomy, respectively, when compared to Christians 
      and Hindus. However, when compared to Muslims, Christian and Hindu groups had a 
      larger share of medical professions. Women with a medical background would opt 
      significantly less for NOTES. Among younger women, NOTES cholecystectomy was 
      refused due to anxiety concerning future pregnancies and sexual dysfunction. 
      Multinomial logistic regression analysis determined medical background and with 
      independent predictive value for the overall choice of interventional technique 
      (p<0.001). Marital status played a significant role only in the comparison of 
      laparoscopy vs transgastric NOTES when performing cholecystectomy and ovariectomy 
      (p<0.01). CONCLUSION: In this first study emanating from the Middle East, medical 
      education and partly life stage rather than cross-cultural differences seem to 
      influence NOTES perception in women.

TI  - Effects of Using Barbed Suture in Myomectomy on Adhesion Formation and Adverse 
      Pregnancy Outcome.
LID - 10.3390/jpm13010092 [doi]
LID - 92
AB  - Background: There is still concern regarding postoperative adhesion formation and 
      adverse effects on pregnancy outcomes caused by barbed suture (BS) after 
      myomectomy. The aim of this study was to compare the postoperative adhesion and 
      pregnancy outcomes between conventional suture (CS) and BS after minimally 
      invasive myomectomy (MIM) by robotic myomectomy (RM) or laparoscopic myomectomy 
      (LM). Methods: The medical records of 94 women who had undergone MIM with CS and 
      97 who had undergone MIM with BS and achieved pregnancy were reviewed. 
      Postoperative adhesion was evaluated following cesarean section. Results: The 
      number of removed myomas was greater (5.3 ± 4.6 vs. 3.5 ± 3.1, p = 0.001) and the 
      size of the largest myoma was larger (7.0 ± 2.2 vs. 5.8 ± 2.7 cm, p = 0.001) in 
      the BS group relative to the CS group. A total of 98.9% of patients in the CS 
      group and 45.4% in the BS group had undergone LM (p < 0.001), while the others 
      underwent RM. There was no significant difference in the presence of 
      postoperative adhesion at cesarean section between the BS and CS groups (45.5 vs. 
      43.7%, p = 0.095). Additionally, there were no intergroup differences in 
      pregnancy complications such as preterm labor, placenta previa, accrete or 
      abruption. Note also that in our logistic regression analysis, the suture type 
      (BS or CS) was excluded from the independent risk factors regarding postoperative 
      adhesion formation. Conclusions: Our data indicated that the incidence of 
      postoperative adhesion after MIM with BS was similar when compared with CS. Also 
      it seems that the suture type does not have a significant effect on pregnancy 
      outcomes.

TI  - Multicenter retrospective cohort Italian study on elective laparoscopic 
      cholecystectomy performed by the surgical residents.

AB  - PURPOSE: This retrospective multicenter cohort study aimed to evaluate the 
      clinical outcomes (mortality rate, operative time, complications) of elective 
      laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) when performed by a surgical resident in 
      comparison to experienced consultant in the backdrop of Italian academic centers. 
      METHODS: Retrospective review of all patients undergoing elective LC between 
      January 2016 and January 2022 at six teaching hospitals across Italy was 
      performed. Cases were identified using the Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) 
      code 5123 (LC without cholangiogram). All cases of emergency surgery, ASA 
      score > 3, or when cholecystectomy was performed with another surgical procedure, 
      were excluded. All suitable cases were divided into 2 groups based on primary 
      surgeon: consultant or senior resident. Main outcome was complication rates 
      (intraoperative and peri/postoperative); secondary outcomes included operative 
      time, the length of stay, and the rate of conversion to open. RESULTS: A total of 
      2331 cases (1425 females) were included, of which, consultants performed 1683 LCs 
      (72%), while the residents performed 648 (28%) surgeries. The groups were 
      statistically comparable regarding demographics, history of previous abdominal 
      surgery, operative time, or intraoperative complications. The rate of conversion 
      to open cholecystectomy was 1.42% for consultant and none for resident 
      (p = 0.02). A statistically significant difference was observed between groups 
      regarding the average length of stay (2.2 ± 3 vs 1.6 ± 1.3 days p = 0.03). 
      Similarly, postoperative complications (1.7% vs 0.5%) resulted in statistically 
      significant (p = 0.02) favoring resident group. CONCLUSIONS: Our study 
      demonstrates that in selected patients, senior residents can safely perform LC 
      when supervised by senior staff surgeons.

TI  - Impact of laparoscopic gastrectomy on long-term prognosis of patients with 
      primary T3 or more advanced gastric cancer: A propensity score matching analysis.
PG  - 594-602
LID - 10.1002/ags3.12651 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: There is no consensus regarding a better long-term prognosis with 
      laparoscopic gastrectomy than with open surgery in patients with advanced gastric 
      cancer, especially in patients with T3 or more advanced gastric cancer. We 
      investigated the impact of laparoscopic gastrectomy on the long-term prognosis of 
      patients who underwent radical gastrectomy for primary T3 or more advanced 
      gastric cancer. METHODS: This single-center, retrospective cohort study included 
      294 consecutive patients who underwent radical gastrectomy for primary T3 or more 
      advanced gastric cancer from April 2008 through April 2017. We compared overall 
      survival between laparoscopic and open surgery, using propensity score matching 
      to adjust for baseline characteristics. We also investigated prognostic factors 
      for overall survival by a forward stepwise procedure of Cox proportional hazards 
      regression for multivariate analysis. RESULTS: There were 136 (46.3%) and 158 
      (53.7%) patients in the laparoscopy and open groups, respectively. The median 
      follow-up period was 39 mo. After matching, there were 97 patients in each group, 
      with no significant differences in background characteristics. After matching, 
      the overall survival was significantly worse in the open group than in the 
      laparoscopy group (P < 0.001). Multivariate analyses also showed that open 
      surgery was an independent poor prognostic factor for overall survival (hazard 
      ratio: 2.160, 95% concordance interval: 1.365-3.419, P = 0.001). CONCLUSION: 
      Overall survival may be better with laparoscopic gastrectomy than with open 
      surgery for patients with primary T3 or more advanced gastric cancer.

TI  - Safety and Feasibility of Primary Closure Following Laparoscopic Common Bile Duct 
      Exploration for Treatment of Choledocholithiasis.
PG  - 1023-1030
LID - 10.1007/s00268-022-06871-9 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: T-tube drainage following laparoscopic common bile duct (CBD) 
      exploration may lead to T-tube displacement and water-electrolyte disorders, 
      affecting patients' quality of life. In particular, biliary peritonitis may 
      develop in a small number of patients after T-tube removal, requiring 
      reoperation. This prospective cohort study was performed to investigate the 
      safety and feasibility of primary closure following laparoscopic CBD exploration 
      for the treatment of choledocholithiasis. METHODS: Patients who were treated for 
      choledocholithiasis by laparoscopic CBD exploration with primary closure from 
      January 2019 to March 2022 comprised the PC group (n = 145). Patients who were 
      treated for choledocholithiasis by laparoscopic CBD exploration with T-tube 
      drainage during this period comprised the TD group (n = 153). Perioperative and 
      follow-up outcomes were collected and statistically analyzed. RESULTS: The TD and 
      PC groups showed significant differences in the operation time (124.6 ± 40.8 vs. 
      106 ± 36.4 min, P = 0.000) and postoperative hospital stay (7.1 ± 2.6 vs. 
      5.9 ± 2.0 days, P = 0.000). No significant difference was observed in terms of 
      blood loss, the ratio of conversion to laparotomy, and postoperative parameters. 
      Preoperative albumin and total bilirubin levels were the risk factors of bile 
      leakage after surgery. No patients developed CBD stricture or carcinogenesis, The 
      rates of residual and recurrent stones in the TD and PC groups were 1.97% vs. 
      1.40% and 1.31% vs. 1.40%, respectively, with no significant difference 
      (P = 1.000 for both). CONCLUSIONS: Primary closure following laparoscopic CBD 
      exploration is safe and feasible for selected patients with choledocholithiasis.

LID - 69
AB  - BACKGROUND: Gastrointestinal attacks are frequent symptoms in patients diagnosed 
      with hereditary angioedema (HAE). Cases of self-limited bowel intussusception and 
      unneeded exploratory laparotomy due to lack of knowledge about HAE have been 
      reported. Furthermore, after the introduction of C1-esterase inhibitor (C1-INH) 
      concentrate, the recommended medication for HAE attacks, treatment has become 
      typically medical in nature. We share a rare case where operative exploration was 
      indicated to resolve a mechanical small bowel obstruction secondary to an HAE 
      attack. CASE REPORT: An 80-year-old woman with HAE presented with lower left 
      abdominal pain, vomiting, and nausea. Computed tomography (CT) showed edema of 
      the small bowel and stomach as well as possible signs of mechanical small bowel 
      obstruction. The patient was treated with C1-INH concentrate but showed only mild 
      signs of relief, warranting diagnostic laparoscopy. Intraoperative findings 
      showed internal herniation and strangulation of the small bowel caused by 
      adhesions forming a band. After surgical intervention, no bowel resection was 
      needed. CONCLUSION: Although C1-INH concentrate remains the principal treatment 
      for HAE, gastrointestinal attacks may potentially cause surgical emergencies.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In patients with a large uterus, an important part of the 
      laparoscopic hysterectomy operation time is the phase of removing the uterus from 
      the abdomen.The development of techniques that will shorten the morcellation time 
      is the key to reducing the total operation time. AIM: To evaluate the effect of 
      vaginal cuff vertical incision in accelerating removal of the large uterus in 
      laparoscopic hysterectomy. METHODS: This study was performed with patients who 
      underwent total laparoscopic hysterectomy. In the study group, a vertical 
      incision was performed in the middle of the posterior vaginal stump before the 
      vaginal removal of the larger uterus (weighing more than 500 g). The control 
      group consisted of patients who underwent vaginal morcellation after conventional 
      colpotomy. Patients in both groups were matched in terms of uterine weights 
      +/-50 g and the same vaginal morcellation technique was applied to all patients. 
      RESULTS: In patients who underwent a vertical incision procedure, the time to 
      remove the uterus from the abdomen (17.55±2.53 min vs 26.62±4.72 min, p<0.001) 
      and the total operation time (130.81±12.83 min vs.143.29±13, 15 min, p = 0.001) 
      was statistically significantly less than the patients without vertical incision. 
      There was no difference between the groups in terms of intraoperative 
      complications, drop in hemoglobin levels, time to flatus, postoperative 6th,24th 
      hour visual analog score and length of hospital stay. CONCLUSIONS: The vertical 
      incision procedure reduces the time to remove the large uterus from the abdomen 
      after laparoscopic hysterectomy and, accordingly, the total operation time. This 
      procedure may be the preferred method before vaginal morcellation, especially in 
      large uterus.

AB  - A 59-year-old post-menopausal female presented with complaints of per vaginal 
      spotting for 3 months. Histopathological examination of contents of dilation and 
      curettage revealed endometrial carcinoma (FIGO stage I), along with benign 
      endocervical polyps. MRI also showed presence of left-sided structure indicative 
      of ectopic pelvic kidney. The patient underwent laparoscopic radical 
      hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy and bilateral ilio-obturator lymph 
      node dissection. Dissection was started along the left pelvic plane. The left 
      pelvic kidney was seen, and left ureter was located and confirmed below the 
      uterus. The patient withstood the procedure well. Anomalies of pelvic anatomy, 
      such as a malpresentation of the kidney and ureter, may prove as surgical 
      challenges while performing open and laparoscopic surgery. However, in depth 
      preoperative imaging, meticulous intraoperative dissection and proper 
      identification of surrounding structures reduces the risk of such complications.

PG  - 1459-1468

AB  - PURPOSE: To assess the quality of care following the establishment of a 
      multidisciplinary care pathway for patient operated on for deep pelvic 
      endometriosis with digestive impairment. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective 
      monocentric study of patients suffering from deep infiltrating endometriosis, 
      treated in Gynaecological Department at Toulouse University Hospital from January 
      2018 to December 2020. We compared our results to those of our previous study, 
      Gornes et al. which showed a postoperative complication occurred in 37.8% of the 
      cases and a postoperative severe complication according to the Clavien-Dindo 
      classification (grades 3b) rate of 18.3%. RESULTS: 98 patients were included. Our 
      study shows a clear decrease in postoperative complications with an overall 
      complication rate of 19.4% and severe complications (grades 3b) of 4.1%. The rate 
      of complication appeared to be significantly less frequent in the case of shaving 
      in relation to other digestive procedures (p = 0.008) and in the case of a lesion 
      of < 20 mm by MRI (p = 0.01). The use of multidisciplinary surgical care was more 
      frequent in the case of multiple locations (66.7% vs. 41.8%, p = 0.07) and was 
      more frequent in the case of transmural damage with echo endoscopy (and to a 
      lesser degree in the case of damage of the muscularis or mucous membrane) 
      (p = 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Multidisciplinary care of endometriosis with digestive 
      damage appears to be indispensable. The intraoperative intervention of a skilled 
      digestive surgeon of bowel endometriosis helps create the best balance between 
      effectiveness-complications-functional prognosis, with a reduction of severe 
      postoperative complications.

PG  - 412

AB  - BACKGROUND: Studies focusing on the relationship between gastric volume and 
      facemask oxygenation without ventilation during apnea in anesthesia induction are 
      scarce. This study compared the change in gastric volume during apnea in 
      anesthesia induction using facemask ventilation and facemask oxygenation without 
      ventilation in adults undergoing laparoscopic surgery. METHODS: In this 
      prospective, randomized, double-blinded trial, 70 adults undergoing laparoscopic 
      surgery under general anesthesia were divided into two groups to receive facemask 
      oxygenation with and without ventilation for 60 seconds after loss of 
      consciousness. Before anesthesia induction and after endotracheal intubation, the 
      gastric antral cross-sectional area was measured with ultrasound imaging. 
      Arterial blood gases were tested at baseline (T1), after preoxygenation (T2), 
      after loss of consciousness (T3), and before and after endotracheal intubation 
      (T4 and T5, respectively). RESULTS: Sixty patients were included (ventilation 
      n = 30; non ventilation n = 30, 10 patients were excluded). The median [IQR] 
      change of gastric antral cross-sectional area in ventilation group was 
      significantly higher than in non ventilation group (0.83 [0.20 to 1.54] vs. 0.10 
      [- 0.11 to 0.56] cm(2), P = 0.001). At T4 and T5, the PaO(2) in ventilation group 
      was significantly higher than in non ventilation group (T4: 391.83 ± 61.53 vs. 
      336.23 ± 74.99 mmHg, P < 0.01; T5: 364.00 ± 58.65 vs. 297.13 ± 86.95 mmHg, 
      P < 0.01), while the PaCO(2) in non ventilation group was significantly higher 
      (T4: 46.57 ± 5.78 vs. 37.27 ± 6.10 mmHg, P < 0.01; T5: 48.77 ± 6.59 vs. 
      42.63 ± 6.03 mmHg, P < 0.01) and the pH value in non ventilation group was 
      significantly lower (T4: 7.35 ± 0.029 vs 7.42 ± 0.047, P < 0.01; T5: 7.34 ± 0.033 
      vs 7.39 ± 0.044, P < 0.01). At T4, the HCO(3)(-) in non ventilation group was 
      significantly higher (25.79 ± 2.36 vs. 23.98 ± 2.18 mmol l(- 1), P < 0.01). 
      CONCLUSIONS: During apnoea, the increase in gastric volume was milder in patients 
      undergoing facemask oxygenation without ventilation than with positive pressure 
      ventilation. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ChiCTR2100054193, 10/12/2021, Title: "Effect of

TI  - Long-term (11 + years) efficacy of sleeve gastrectomy as a stand-alone bariatric 
      procedure: a single-center retrospective observational study.
PG  - 4
LID - 10.1007/s00423-022-02734-y [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Sleeve gastrectomy (SG) is currently the most commonly performed 
      bariatric procedure worldwide. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the 
      long-term efficacy of SG as a stand-alone bariatric procedure. METHODS: A 
      single-center retrospective analysis of 104 patients who underwent SG as a 
      stand-alone bariatric procedure between January 2005 and December 2009. Weight 
      loss, weight regain, remission or improvement of comorbidities and the new onset 
      of comorbidities were the main outcomes of the study. RESULTS: The percent excess 
      body weight loss (%EBWL), percent excess body mass weight (BMI) loss (%EBMIL), 
      and percent total body weight loss (%TBWL) were 59 ± 25, 69 ± 29, and 29 ± 12, 
      respectively, after a mean follow-up of 13.4 years. At the last follow-up, nearly 
      two thirds of patients (67.3%) had an %EBWL greater than 50. The percentage of 
      patients who experienced significant weight regain ranged from 47 to 64%, 
      depending on the definition used for weight regain. The rate of improvement or 
      remission of hypertension, type 2 diabetes, dyslipidemia, obstructive sleep 
      apnea, and degenerative joint disease at a mean follow-up of 13.4 years was 40%, 
      94.7%, 70%, 100%, and 42.9%, respectively. The new onset of gastroesophageal 
      reflux disease (GERD) symptoms in the same period was 43%. CONCLUSION: Our data 
      supports that SG results in long-lasting weight loss in the majority of patients 
      and acceptable rates of remission or improvement of comorbidities. Weight regain 
      and GERD may be issues of particular concern during long-term follow-up after SG.

TI  - Laparoscopic Sacrocervicopexy Using Ethibond Suture Graft: A Very Economic Yet 
      Effective Fertility Preserving Surgery for Pelvic Organ Prolapse.
PG  - e33086
LID - 10.7759/cureus.33086 [doi]
LID - e33086
AB  - BACKGROUND: The modern era has witnessed a transition to a phase of 
      uterus-preserving surgeries and so holds true for pelvic organ prolapse (POP) 
      surgeries as well. Laparoscopic sacrocervicopexy has become a preferred surgical 
      modality for moderate to severe degrees of POP in most women of the childbearing 
      age group. With the alarming incidences of mesh erosion, synthetic mesh has 
      almost gone off the market. We advocate a very simple and cost-effective 
      technique of laparoscopic sacrocervicopexy using an Ethibond suture graft. 
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: It was a pilot prospective observational study over one 
      year. Consecutive consenting women with symptomatic prolapsed uterus Stage-II of 
      the central component of the quantitative POP classification (POP-Q) were 
      recruited. Laparoscopic sacrocervicopexy was performed under general anesthesia 
      using the standard protocols, and patients were prospectively followed for six 
      months after surgery. The duration of surgery and hospital stay were noted. 
      Patient satisfaction was rated using a five-point Likert scale. The vaginal 
      length was measured immediately after and six months post-surgery. Sexual 
      function was assessed using the validated female sexual function index (FSFI) 
      scale six months after sacrocervicopexy. RESULTS: Out of 28 recruited women, the 
      majority were multiparous, highly qualified, and belonged to the middle 
      socio-economic class. Seven patients had co-morbidity in the form of hypertension 
      (17.8%), diabetes (7.1%), and cardiovascular diseases (7.1%). The mean duration 
      of surgery was 105.8±7.2 minutes in the study population. The mean duration of 
      hospital stay was 2.2±0.6 days. No surgical site infection was noted in any of 
      the cases. Most patients rated "very satisfied" experiences following surgery 
      (67.9%). The mean vaginal length after surgery was 7.6±1.2 centimeters. After a 
      follow-up period of six months, the mean vaginal length was 7.4±0.8 centimeters. 
      The mean FSFI score was 30.8±2.4. CONCLUSION: Laparoscopic sacrocervicopexy with 
      Ethibond suture graft is a cost-effective and safe surgical technique for POP in 
      resource-limited settings. It also obviates the additional cost of synthetic mesh 
      and the long-term risks of mesh erosion.
