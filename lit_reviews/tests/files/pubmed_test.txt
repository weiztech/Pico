TI  - Impact of Pulsatile Flow Settings on Hemodynamic Energy Levels Using the Novel 
      Diagonal Medos DP3 Pump in a Simulated Pediatric Extracorporeal Life Support 
      System.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The objective of this study was to evaluate the pump performance of 
      the novel diagonal Medos Deltastream DP3 diagonal pump (MEDOS Medizintechnik AG, 
      , Stolberg, Germany) under nonpulsatile to pulsatile mode with varying 
      differential speed values in a simulated pediatric extracorporeal life support 
      system. METHODS: The experimental circuit consisted of a Medos Deltastream DP3 
      pump head and console, a Medos Hilite 2400 LT hollow fiber membrane oxygenator 
      (MEDOS Medizintechnik AG), a 14F Medtronic DLP arterial cannula (Medtronic Inc, 
      Minnesota), and a 20F Terumo TenderFlow Pediatric venous return cannula (Terumo 
      Corporation, Michigan). Trials were conducted at flow rates ranging from 500 
      mL/min to 2,000 mL/min (500 mL/min increments) and pulsatile differential speed 
      values ranging from 500 rpm to 2,500 rpm (500 rpm increments) using human blood 
      (hematocrit 35%). The postcannula pressure was maintained constantly at 60 mm Hg. 
      Real-time pressure and flow data were recorded using a custom-made data 
      acquisition system and Labview software. RESULTS: Under all experimental 
      conditions, pulsatile flow (P) generated significantly greater energy equivalent 
      pressure (EEP), surplus hemodynamic energy (SHE), and total hemodynamic energy 
      (THE) than those of nonpulsatile flow (NP). Under NP, SHE was zero. Higher 
      differential speed values generated greater EEP, SHE, and THE values. There was 
      little variation in the oxygenator pressure drop and the cannula pressure drop in 
      P, compared to NP. CONCLUSIONS: The novel Medos Deltastream DP3 diagonal pump is 
      able to generate physiological quality of P, without backflow. With increased 
      differential rpm, the pump generated greater EEP, SHE, and THE. Physiological 
      quality of pulsatility may be associated with better microcirculation because of 
      greater EEP, SHE, and THE.

TI  - Effects of Pulsatile Control Algorithms for Diagonal Pump on Hemodynamic 
      Performance and Hemolysis.
PG  - 60-75
LID - 10.1111/aor.13284 [doi]
AB  - The objective of this study is to compare hemodynamic performances under 
      different pulsatile control algorithms between Medos DeltaStream DP3 and i-cor 
      diagonal pumps in simulated pediatric and adult ECLS systems. An additional pilot 
      study was designed to test hemolysis using two pumps during 12h-ECLS. The 
      experimental circuit consisted of parallel combined pediatric and adult ECLS 
      circuits using an i-cor pump head and either an i-cor console or Medos 
      DeltaStream MDC console, a Medos Hilite 2400 LT oxygenator for the pediatric ECLS 
      circuit, and a Medos Hilite 7000 LT oxygenator for the adult ECLS circuit. The 
      circuit was primed with lactated Ringer's solution and human packed red blood 
      cells (hematocrit 40%). Trials were conducted at various flow rates (pediatric 
      circuit: 0.5 and 1L/min; adult circuit: 2 and 4L/min) under nonpulsatile and 
      pulsatile modes (pulsatile amplitude: 1000-5000rpm [1000 rpm increments] for 
      i-cor pump, 500-2500rpm [500 rpm increments] for Medos pump) at 36°C. In an 
      additional protocol, fresh whole blood was used to test hemolysis under 
      nonpulsatile and pulsatile modes using the two pump systems in adult ECLS 
      circuits. Under pulsatile mode, energy equivalent pressures (EEP) were always 
      greater than mean pressures for the two systems. Total hemodynamic energy (THE) 
      and surplus hemodynamic energy (SHE) levels delivered to the patient increased 
      with increasing pulsatile amplitude and decreased with increasing flow rate. The 
      i-cor pump outperformed at low flow rates, but the Medos pump performed 
      superiorly at high flow rates. There was no significant difference between two 
      pumps in percentage of THE loss. The plasma free hemoglobin level was always 
      higher in the Medos DP3 pulsatile group at 4 L/min compared to others. Pulsatile 
      control algorithms of Medos and i-cor consoles had great effects on pulsatility. 
      Although high pulsatile amplitudes delivered higher levels of hemodynamic energy 
      to the patient, the high rotational speeds increased the risk of hemolysis. Use 
      of proper pulsatile amplitude settings and intermittent pulsatile mode are 
      suggested to achieve better pulsatility and decrease the risk of hemolysis. 
      Further optimized pulsatile control algorithms are needed.

TI  - First experience with the deltastream(R) DP3 in venovenous extracorporeal 
      membrane oxygenation and air-supported inter-hospital transport.
PG  - 773-7
LID - 10.1093/icvts/ivt320 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Based on continuous technical innovations and recent research, 
      extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has become a promising tool in the 
      treatment of patients with acute (cardio)pulmonary failure. Nevertheless, any 
      extracorporeal technique requires a high degree of experience and knowledge, so 
      that a restriction to specialized centres seems to be reasonable. As a 
      consequence of this demand, the need for inter-hospital transfer of patients with 
      severely impaired (cardio)pulmonary function is rising. Unfortunately, most of 
      the ECMO devices used in the clinical setting are not suitable for inter-hospital 
      transport because of their size, weight or complexity. In this article, we 
      describe our first experiences with the airborne transport of 6 patients on a new 
      portable, miniaturized and lightweight extracorporeal circulation system, the 
      Medos deltastream® DP3. METHODS: Six patients suffering acute respiratory failure 
      were taken on venovenous ECMO (DP3) out-of-centre and transferred to the 
      University Medical Center Regensburg by helicopter. All 
      cardiorespiratory-relevant parameters of the patients and the technical 
      functioning of the device were continuously monitored and documented. RESULTS: 
      Implantation of the device and air-supported transport were performed without any 
      technical complications. The patients were transported from a distance of 66-178 
      km, requiring a time of 40-120 min. With the help of the new deltastream® DP3 
      ECMO device, a prompt stabilization of the cardiopulmonary function could be 
      achieved in all patients. One patient was under ongoing cardiopulmonary 
      resuscitation by the time our ECMO team arrived at the peripheral hospital and 
      died shortly after arrival in the central emergency ward. CONCLUSIONS: Our 
      experience shows that the deltastream® DP3 is an absolutely reliable and safe 
      ECMO device that could gain growing importance in the field of airborne 
      transportation of patients on ECMO due to its unsophisticated, miniaturized and 
      lightweight characteristics.

TI  - Initial Clinical Experiences With Novel Diagonal ECLS System in Pediatric Cardiac 
      Patients.
PG  - 717-726
LID - 10.1111/aor.12977 [doi]
AB  - Extracorporeal life support (ECLS) provides mechanical support following cardiac 
      surgery when respiratory or cardiac failure occurs. The aim of this study was to 
      analyze the safety and feasibility of the Medos Deltastream diagonal pump (DP3) 
      ECLS system in pediatric cardiac patients. We described the technical 
      considerations and risk factors related to the survival outcomes in 102 pediatric 
      cardiac patients who received ECLS support between March 2011 and April 2016. We 
      switched from the DP2 system, which was used for the initial 25 patients, to the 
      DP3 system after November 2012. The DP3 was then used in a consecutive series of 
      77 patients (4.5% of all pediatric patients who underwent congenital heart 
      surgery during the same time period). The patients' median age was 90 days 
      (range: 2 days-12 years), while their median weight was 4 kg (range: 2.1-40 kg). 
      Fifty four patients (70%) were weaned off ECLS, while 28 patients (36.3%) were 
      successfully discharged from the hospital by means of the DP3 system. The median 
      ECLS duration for survivors was 8.2 days (range: 4-14.5 days). The ECLS 
      indications, durations, and initiation times had no statistical significance in 
      terms of survival. Renal, hemorrhagic, and neurologic complications were all 
      associated with decreased hospital discharge rates (P = 0.003, P = 0.045, and 
      P < 0.001 respectively). Higher lactate levels (P = 0.009) and longer duration 
      for normalization (P < 0.001) were both associated to failure to wean off ECLS 
      support and, hence, to hospital deaths. The weaning rate was 36% prior to 
      November 2012. It increased to 70.3% after that time (P = 0.009). The mechanical 
      complication rate was 9% with the DP3 system and 32% with the DP2, which was 
      statistically significant (P = 0.009). Additionally, the lactate levels were 
      higher and decreased more slowly in the patients supported by the DP2. As a 
      result of the shift to the DP3 system, a revised ECLS protocol, and increased 
      ECLS experience, a significant improvement was observed in our clinical outcomes. 
      The results of this study suggested that the combination of a DP3 pump and a 
      Hilite oxygenator in pediatric ECLS circuits may improve durability and reduce 
      circuit-induced complications.

TI  - Impact of pulsatile flow on hemodynamic energy in a Medos Deltastream DP3 
      pediatric extracorporeal life support system.
PG  - 19-27
LID - 10.1111/aor.12117 [doi]
AB  - The Medos Deltastream DP3 system is made up of a novel diagonal pump and 
      hollow-membrane oxygenator that provides nonpulsatile and pulsatile flows for 
      extracorporeal life support (ECLS). The objectives of this study are to (i) 
      evaluate the efficacy of the hemodynamic energy provided by Medos Deltastream DP3 
      system in nonpulsatile and pulsatile mode and (ii) to evaluate the pulsatile mode 
      under different frequencies. The experimental ECLS circuit was used in this 
      study, primed with Ringer's lactate and packed red blood cells (hematocrit 35%). 
      All trials were conducted at flow rates of 500, 1000, 1500, and 2000 mL/min with 
      modified pulsatile frequencies of 60, 70, 80, and 90 bpm at 36°C. Simultaneous 
      blood flow and pressures at the pre/postoxygenator and pre/postcannula sites were 
      recorded for quantification of the pulsatile perfusion-generated 
      energy-equivalent pressure (EEP), surplus hemodynamic energy (SHE), and total 
      hemodynamic energy (THE). The experiments showed that under pulsatile flow 
      conditions, at all flow rates and frequencies, (i) the EEP, SHE, and THE were 
      significantly higher when compared with the nonpulsatile group and (ii) the 
      pressure drop was minimal at lower flow rates and lower pulsatile frequencies but 
      was significant when either the flow rate or the pulsatile frequency was 
      increased. The Medos Deltastream DP3 System can provide nonpulsatile flow and 
      physiologic quality pulsatile flow for pediatric ECLS. When the Medos DP3 
      pediatric ECLS system is used with pulsatile flow, there is more surplus 
      hemodynamic energy and total hemodynamic energy than nonpulsatile flow.

AB  - The objective of this study was to compare the systemic inflammatory response and 
      hemolytic characteristics of a conventional roller pump (HL20-NP) and an 
      alternative diagonal pump with nonpulsatile (DP3-NP) and pulsatile mode (DP3-P) 
      in simulated neonatal extracorporeal life support (ECLS) systems. The 
      experimental neonatal ECLS circuits consist of a conventional Jostra HL20 roller 
      pump or an alternative Medos DP3 diagonal pump, and Medos Hilite 800 LT 
      hollow-fiber oxygenator with diffusion membrane. Eighteen sterile circuits were 
      primed with freshly donated whole blood and divided into three groups: 
      conventional HL20 with nonpulsatile flow (HL20-NP), DP3 with nonpulsatile flow 
      (DP3-NP), and DP3 with pulsatile flow (DP3-P). All trials were conducted for 
      durations of 12 h at a flow rate of 500 mL/min at 36°C. Simultaneous blood flow 
      and pressure waveforms were recorded. Blood samples were collected to measure 
      plasma-free hemoglobin (PFH), human tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-6 
      (IL-6), and IL-8, in addition to the routine blood gas, lactate dehydrogenase, 
      and lactic acid levels. HL20-NP group had the highest PFH levels (mean ± standard 
      error of the mean) after a 12-h ECLS run, but the difference among groups did not 
      reach statistical significance (HL20-NP group: 907.6 ± 253.1 mg/L, DP3-NP group: 
      343.7 ± 163.2 mg/L, and DP3-P group: 407.6 ± 156.6 mg/L, P = 0.06). Although 
      there were similar trends but no statistical differences for the levels of 
      proinflammatory cytokines among the three groups, the HL20-NP group had much 
      greater levels than the other groups (P > 0.05). Pulsatile flow generated higher 
      total hemodynamic energy and surplus hemodynamic energy levels at pre-oxygenator 
      and pre-clamp sites (P < 0.01). Our study demonstrated that the alternative 
      diagonal pump ECLS circuits appeared to have less systemic inflammatory response 
      and hemolysis compared with the conventional roller pump ECLS circuit in 
      simulated neonatal ECLS systems. Pulsatile flow delivered more hemodynamic energy 
      to the pseudo-patient without increased odds of hemolysis compared with the 
      conventional, nonpulsatile roller pump group.

AB  - Purpose: Blood damage has been associated with patients under temporary 
      continuous-flow mechanical circulatory support. To evaluate the side effects 
      caused by transit blood pumping, in vitro hemocompatibility testing for blood 
      damage in pumps is considered a necessary reference before clinical trials. 
      Methods: The hemocompatibility of five extracorporeal centrifugal blood pumps was 
      investigated comprehensively, including four commercial pumps (the Abbott 
      CentriMag, the Terumo Capiox, the Medos DP3, and the Medtronic BPX-80) and a pump 
      in development (the magAssist MoyoAssist(®)). In vitro, hemolysis was tested with 
      heparinized porcine blood at nominal operating conditions (5 L/min, 160 mmHg) and 
      extreme operating conditions (1 L/min, 290 mmHg) using a circulation flow loop. 
      Hematology analyses concerning the blood cell counts and the degradation of 
      high-molecular-weight von Willebrand factor (VWF) during 6-h circulation were 
      also evaluated. Results: Comparing the in vitro hemocompatibility of blood pumps 
      at different operations, the blood damage was significantly more severe at 
      extreme operating conditions than that at nominal operating conditions. The 
      performance of the five blood pumps was arranged in different orders at these two 
      operating conditions. The results also demonstrated superior hemocompatibility of 
      CentriMag and MoyoAssist(®) at two operating conditions, with overall low blood 
      damage at hemolysis level, blood cell counts, and degradation of 
      high-molecular-weight VWF. It suggested that magnetic bearings have an advantage 
      in hemocompatibility compared to the mechanical bearing of blood pumps. 
      Conclusion: Involving multiple operating conditions of blood pumps in in vitro 
      hemocompatibility evaluation will be helpful for clinical application. In 
      addition, the magnetically levitated centrifugal blood pump MoyoAssist(®) shows 
      great potential in the future as it demonstrated good in vitro hemocompatibility.

LID - 10.1097/MAT.0000000000000385 [doi]
AB  - This study reports a single-centre experience of the Medos Deltastream 
      diagonal-pump (DP3) for extracorporeal cardiac, pulmonary, or combined support in 
      a single-center pediatric cohort. Twenty-seven consecutive patients with 28 runs 
      of the DP3 between January 2013 and June 2014 were included for analysis. Median 
      patient age, weight, and duration of support were 278 days (range: 0 days-14.2 
      years), 7.2 kg (range: 2.5-39 kg), and 8 days (range: 2-69 days). Midline 
      sternotomy (n = 20, 71.4%) or cervical approaches (n = 8, 28.6%) were used for 
      cannulation. The DP3 was employed for either veno-arterial extracorporeal life 
      support (ECLS, n = 16), veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO, n 
      = 5), or ventricular assist devices (right ventricular assist device [RVAD], n = 
      1; left ventricular assist device [LVAD], n = 1; and univentricular assist device 
      [UNIVAD], n = 5). Three patients initially supported with ECLS were switched to 
      UNIVAD and one patient with UNIVAD was changed to ECLS. Required flow for 
      neonates (n = 8) ranged between 0.2 and 0.75 L/min. Irreversible pump damage 
      occurred in one patient during deairing after air block. Successful weaning, 30 
      day and hospital survival were 89.3% (n = 25), 85.7% (n = 24), and 71.4% (n = 
      20). All patients on UNIVAD, who did not require further extracorporeal 
      respiratory assist, survived. In conclusion, the DP3 can be used for individual 
      patient demands and adapted to their most suitable method of support. Meticulous 
      flow adjustments render this pump highly effective for extracorporeal support 
      particularly in pediatric patients.

TI  - Novel pulsatile diagonal pump for pediatric extracorporeal life support system.
PG  - 37-47
LID - 10.1111/aor.12015 [doi]
AB  - A novel pulsatile rotary flow pump has been used in clinical extracorporeal life 
      support (ECLS) in Europe. The objective of this study is to evaluate the Medos 
      Deltastream DP3 diagonal pump (Medos Medizintechnik AG, Stolberg, Germany) in a 
      simulated pediatric ECLS system. The ECLS circuit consisted of a Medos Hilite 
      800LT hollow fiber membrane oxygenator (Medos Medizintechnik AG), a Medos 
      Deltastream DP3 diagonal pump, a 10Fr Terumo TenderFlow Pediatric Arterial 
      Cannula (Terumo Corporation, Tokyo, Japan), and an arterial/venous tubing. All 
      trials were conducted at flow rates ranging from 200-800 mL/min (in 200 mL/min 
      increments) under a blood temperature of 35°C using human blood (hematocrit 40%). 
      The postcannula pressure was maintained 60 mm Hg by a Hoffman clamp. Real-time 
      pressure and flow data were recorded using a Labview-based acquisition system 
      (National Instruments, Austin, TX, USA). The results showed that the Medos 
      Deltastream DP3 can generate effective pulsatile flow without backflow, provide 
      higher flow rates and pressures than nonpulsatile flow, and then create surplus 
      hemodynamic energy and more total hemodynamic energy than nonpulsatile flow. 
      Pulsatility increased with increased speed differential values and flow rates, 
      while the oxygenator pressure drop increased at an acceptable level. The Medos 
      Deltastream DP3 diagonal pump can provide adequate quality of pulsatility without 
      backflow, and generate more hemodynamic energy under pulsatile mode in a 
      simulated pediatric ECLS system.

AB  - Technological innovations in pediatric extracorporeal life support circuits can 
      reduce system-related complications and may improve patients' outcome. The 
      Deltastream DP3 (Medos Medizintechnik AG, Stolberg, Germany) is a novel 
      rotational pump with a diagonally streamed impeller that can be used over a broad 
      range of flows. We collected patient data from seven pediatric centers to conduct 
      a retrospective cohort study. We examined 233 patients whose median age was 1.9 
      (0-201) months. The DP3 system was used for cardiopulmonary support as 
      veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) in 162 patients. 
      Respiratory support via veno-venous ECMO was provided in 63 patients. The pump 
      was used as a ventricular assist device in eight patients. Median supporting time 
      was 5.5 (0.2-69) days and the weaning rate was 72.5%. The discharge home rate was 
      62% in the pulmonary group versus 55% in the cardiac group. Extracorporeal 
      cardiopulmonary resuscitation was carried out in 24 patients (10%) with a 
      survival to discharge of rate of 37.5%. About 106 (47%) children experienced no 
      complications, while 33% suffered bleeding requiring blood transfusion or 
      surgical intervention. Three patients suffered a fatal cerebral event. Renal 
      replacement therapy was performed in 28% and pump or oxygenator exchange in 26%. 
      Multivariable analysis identified system exchange (OR 1.94), kidney failure (OR 
      3.43), and complications on support (OR 2.56) as risk factors for dismal outcome. 
      This novel diagonal pump has demonstrated its efficacy in all kinds of mechanical 
      circulatory and respiratory support, revealing good survival rates.

TI  - A comparison study of haemolysis production in three contemporary centrifugal 
      pumps.
PG  - 411-6
LID - 10.1177/0267659113509000 [doi]
AB  - One challenge in providing extracorporeal circulation is to supply optimal flow 
      while minimising adverse effects, such as haemolysis. To determine if the recent 
      generation constrained vortex pumps with their inherent design improvements would 
      lead to reduced red cell trauma, we undertook a study comparing three devices. 
      Utilizing a simulated short-term ventricular assist circuit primed with whole 
      human blood, we examined changes in plasma free haemoglobin values over a six-day 
      period. The three pumps investigated were the Maquet Rotaflow, the Levitronix 
      PediVAS and the Medos Deltastream DP3.This study demonstrated that all three 
      pumps produced low levels of haemolysis and are suitable for use in a clinical 
      environment. The Levitronix PediVAS was significantly less haemolytic than either 
      the Rotaflow (p<0.05) or the DP3 (p<0.05). There was no significant difference in 
      plasma free haemoglobin between the Rotaflow and the DP3 (p=0.71).

TI  - Building a Better Neonatal Extracorporeal Life Support Circuit: Comparison of 
      Hemodynamic Performance and Gaseous Microemboli Handling in Different Pump and 
      Oxygenator Technologies.
PG  - 392-400
LID - 10.1111/aor.12908 [doi]
AB  - Neurologic complications during neonatal extracorporeal life support (ECLS) are 
      associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Gaseous microemboli (GME) in 
      the ECLS circuit may be a possible cause. Advances in neonatal circuitry may 
      improve hemodynamic performance and GME handling leading to reduction in patient 
      complications. This study compared hemodynamic performance and GME handling using 
      two centrifugal pumps (Maquet RotaFlow and Medos Deltastream DP3) and 
      polymethylpentene oxygenators (Maquet Quadrox-iD and Medos Hilite 800LT) in a 
      neonatal ECLS circuit model. The experimental circuit was primed with Lactated 
      Ringer's solution and packed human red blood cells (hematocrit 40%) and arranged 
      in parallel with the RotaFlow and DP3 pump, Quadrox-iD and Hilite oxygenator, and 
      Better-Bladder. Hemodynamic trials evaluating pressure drops and total 
      hemodynamic energy (THE) were conducted at 300 and 500 mL/min at 36°C. GME 
      handling was measured after 0.5 mL of air was injected into the venous line using 
      the Emboli Detection and Classification Quantifier System with unique pump, 
      oxygenator, and Better-Bladder combinations. The RotaFlow pump and Quadrox 
      oxygenator arrangement had lower pressure drops and THE loss at both flow rates 
      compared to the DP3 pump and Hilite oxygenator (P < 0.01). Total GME volume and 
      counts decreased with Better-Bladder at both flow rates with all combinations 
      (P < 0.01). Hemodynamic performance and energy loss were similar in all of the 
      circuit combinations. The Better-Bladder significantly decreased GME. All four 
      combinations of pumps and oxygenators also performed similarly in terms of GME 
      handling.

TI  - First serial in vivo results of mechanical circulatory support in children with a 
      new diagonal pump.
PG  - 828-35
LID - 10.1093/ejcts/ezt427 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Mechanical circulatory support (MCS) is a rescue therapy for infants 
      and children suffering from severe cardiorespiratory failure with specific 
      system-related complications like bleeding, thromboembolism and device failure. 
      Novel circuit components for temporary MCS with improved haemodynamic properties 
      may improve patients' outcome and reduce system-related morbidities. The 
      Deltastream DP3 (Medos Medizintechnik AG, Stolberg, Germany) is a newly designed 
      rotational pump with a diagonally streamed impeller that can be used in children 
      of all ages (priming volume 16 ml, flow 0-8 l/min). The aim of this study was to 
      analyse the feasibility and safety of the DP3 pump system in children. METHODS: 
      We retrospectively investigated a consecutive series of 16 children [median age 
      0.9 months (0.1-55 months), median weight 3.2 kg (2.5-14 kg)]. The DP3 circuit 
      was used 22 times in these children for different indications: (I) extracorporeal 
      life support (ECLS) in post-cardiotomy heart failure (n = 11), (II) ECLS in 
      cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) (n = 7) and (III) extracorporeal membrane 
      oxygenation (ECMO) in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (n = 4). 
      RESULTS: Median duration of MCS was 4 days (0-18 days), 12 patients (75%) were 
      weaned successfully from MCS, 4 of these children (25%) died after weaning, with 
      a median survival time of 15 days (6-28 days). Overall survival rate was 50% and 
      all 8 survivors were discharged home without neurological injury. There was no 
      case of severe bleeding, thromboembolic complications or device failure. Mean 
      lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) before MCS was 700 (±384) U/l, and increased to a 
      maximum of 2279 (±2635) U/l during MCS (P = 0.04). Baseline D-dimer values were 
      3.4 (±3.0) mg/l and rose significantly to 19.5 (±11.5) mg/l during MCS (P < 
      0.001). The mean of the highest plasma-free haemoglobin during MCS was 21.0 
      (±42.9) mg/dl. The increase in plasma-free haemoglobin correlated moderately with 
      the duration of MCS (Pearson's r: 0.78). CONCLUSION: The use of the Deltastream 
      DP3 seems to be safe and effective for MCS in children and may show a low degree 
      of haemolysis. We observed no system-related complications and an overall good 
      outcome in this demanding patient cohort.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the incidence of hemolysis and its association with 
      outcome in neonates with congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) requiring 
      venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) treatment using a Medos 
      Deltastream circuit with a DP3 pump, a hilite 800 LT oxygenator system, and a ¼' 
      tubing. STUDY DESIGN: Plasma free hemoglobin (PFH) was prospectively measured 
      once daily during ECMO using spectrophotometric testing. Patients (n = 62) were 
      allocated into two groups according to presence or absence of hemolysis. 
      Hemolysis was defined as PFH ≥ 50 mg/dL on at least 2 consecutive days during 
      ECMO treatment. Hemolysis was classified as either moderate with a maximum PFH of 
      50-100 mg/dL or severe with a maximum PFH >100 mg/dL. RESULTS: Hemolysis was 
      detected in 14 patients (22.6%). Mortality was 100% in neonates with hemolysis 
      compared with 31.1% in neonates without hemolysis (P < .001). In 21.4% hemolysis 
      was moderate and in 78.6% severe. Using multivariable analysis, hemolysis (hazard 
      ratio: 6.8; 95%CI: 1.86-24.86) and suprasystemic pulmonary hypertension (PH) 
      (hazard ratio: 3.07; 95%CI: 1.01-9.32) were independently associated with 
      mortality. Hemolysis occurred significantly more often using 8 French (Fr) 
      cannulae than 13 Fr cannulae (43% vs 17%; P = .039). Cutoff for relative ECMO 
      flow to predict hemolysis were 115 ml/kg/ minute for patients with 8 Fr cannulae 
      (Area under the curve [AUC] 0.786, P = .042) and 100 ml/kg/ minute for patients 
      with 13 Fr cannulae (AUC 0.840, P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: Hemolysis in CDH neonates 
      receiving venovenous ECMO is independently associated with mortality.

AB  - The objective of this study was to evaluate the pump performance of the 
      third-generation Medos diagonal pump, the Deltastream DP3, on hemodynamic profile 
      and pulsatility in a simulated pediatric mechanical circulatory support (MCS) 
      system. The experimental circuit consisted of a Medos Deltastream DP3 pump head 
      and console (MEDOS Medizintechnik AG, Stolberg, Germany), a 14-Fr Terumo 
      TenderFlow Pediatric arterial cannula and a 20-Fr Terumo TenderFlow Pediatric 
      venous return cannula (Terumo Corporation, Tokyo, Japan), and 3 ft of tubing with 
      an internal diameter of in. for both arterial and venous lines. Trials were 
      conducted at flow rates ranging from 250 mL/min to 1000 mL/min (250-mL/min 
      increments) and rotational speeds ranging from 1000 to 4000 rpm (1000-rpm 
      increments) using human blood (hematocrit 40%). The postcannula pressure was 
      maintained at 60 mm Hg by a Hoffman clamp. Real-time pressure and flow data were 
      recorded using a Labview-based acquisition system. The pump provided adequate 
      nonpulsatile and pulsatile flow, created more hemodynamic energy under pulsatile 
      mode, and generated higher positive and negative pressures when the inlet and 
      outlet of the pump head, respectively, were clamped. After the conversion from 
      nonpulsatile to pulsatile mode, the flow rates and the rotational speeds 
      increased. In conclusion, the novel Medos Deltastream DP3 diagonal pump is able 
      to supply the required flow rate for pediatric MCS, generate adequate quality of 
      pulsatility, and provide surplus hemodynamic energy output in a simulated 
      pediatric MCS system.

TI  - In vitro comparison of the delivery of gaseous microemboli and hemodynamic energy 
      for a diagonal and a roller pump during simulated infantile cardiopulmonary 
      bypass procedures.
PG  - 56-63
LID - 10.1111/aor.12126 [doi]
AB  - Cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) is used for a variety of procedures in pediatric 
      patients. Flow settings of the CPB pump have dramatic effects on patient outcome, 
      and gaseous microemboli delivery within the CPB circuit has been linked to 
      neurological complications. To ensure the ongoing improvement of pediatric CPB, 
      consistent evaluation and improvement of the equipment is necessary. In this 
      study we analyze the Jostra HL-20 roller pump (Jostra USA, Austin, TX, USA) and a 
      Medos Deltastream DP3 diagonal pump (MEDOS Medizintechnik AG, Stolberg, Germany) 
      which has not yet received Food and Drug Administration approval. An infant CPB 
      model with heparinized human blood is used to quantify the gaseous microemboli 
      delivery (via an Emboli Detection and Classification Quantifier), as well as the 
      hemodynamic energy delivered under flow rates of 400, 800, and 1200 mL/min. 
      Results show that at most flow settings the DP3 delivers fewer microemboli than 
      the Jostra roller pump at the pre-oxygenator site, with an exception at 
      1200 mL/min under pulsatile mode. The total volume and the number of gaseous 
      microemboli greater than 40 μm in diameter were lower in the DP3 group. The HL-20 
      exhibits less stolen blood flow (except at 1200 mL/min) and oxygenator pressure 
      drops in both pulsatile and nonpulsatile mode. Additionally, under pulsatile flow 
      the DP3 delivers greater surplus hemodynamic energy. Both pumps produce 
      relatively few microemboli and deliver adequate hemodynamic energy to the 
      pseudo-patient, with the DP3 performing slightly better under most flow settings.

TI  - Evaluation of conventional nonpulsatile and novel pulsatile extracorporeal life 
      support systems in a simulated pediatric extracorporeal life support model.
PG  - E1-9
LID - 10.1111/aor.12290 [doi]
AB  - The objective of this study is to evaluate two extracorporeal life support (ECLS) 
      circuits and determine the effect of pulsatile flow on pressure drop, 
      flow/pressure waveforms, and hemodynamic energy levels in a pediatric 
      pseudopatient. One ECLS circuit consisted of a Medos Deltastream DP3 diagonal 
      pump and Hilite 2400 LT oxygenator with arterial/venous tubing. The second 
      circuit consisted of a Maquet RotaFlow centrifugal pump and Quadrox-iD Pediatric 
      oxygenator with arterial/venous tubing. A 14Fr Medtronic Bio-Medicus one-piece 
      pediatric arterial cannula was used for both circuits. All trials were conducted 
      at flow rates ranging from 500 to 2800 mL/min using pulsatile or nonpulsatile 
      flow. The post-cannula pressure was maintained at 50 mm Hg. Blood temperature was 
      maintained at 36°C. Real-time pressure and flow data were recorded using a 
      custom-based data acquisition system. The results showed that the Deltastream DP3 
      circuit produced surplus hemodynamic energy (SHE) in pulsatile mode at all flow 
      rates, with greater SHE delivery at lower flow rates. Neither circuit produced 
      SHE in nonpulsatile mode. The Deltastream DP3 pump also demonstrated consistently 
      higher total hemodynamic energy at the pre-oxygenator site in pulsatile mode and 
      a lesser pressure drop across the oxygenator. The Deltastream DP3 pump generated 
      physiological pulsatility without backflow and provided increased hemodynamic 
      energy. This novel ECLS circuit demonstrates suitable in vitro performance and 
      adaptability to a wide range of pediatric patients.

TI  - Hemostatic Changes During Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation: A Prospective 
      Randomized Clinical Trial Comparing Three Different Extracorporeal Membrane 
      Oxygenation Systems.
PG  - 747-54
LID - 10.1097/CCM.0000000000001482 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation is a rescue therapy for patients 
      with severe lung failure. Major complications caused by extracorporeal membrane 
      oxygenation are bleeding, thrombosis, and hemolysis. The aim of this study was to 
      compare the impact of different extracorporeal membrane oxygenation systems on 
      blood hemostasis in adults during veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation 
      therapy. DESIGN: Single center prospective randomized study. SETTING: University 
      Hospital Regensburg, Germany. PATIENTS: Adult patients with severe acute 
      respiratory distress syndrome requiring veno-venous extracorporeal membrane 
      oxygenation therapy. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Three 
      different extracorporeal membrane oxygenation systems: the Cardiohelp system 
      (Maquet Cardiopulmonary AG), the Dideco ECC.O5 (Sorin Group), and the Deltastream 
      system with Hilite 7000 LT + DP3 pumphead (Medos Medizintechnik AG) were 
      compared. Therefore hemostasis, anticoagulation, hemolysis, and inflammatory 
      parameters were monitored. Of the 54 patients included in the study, 18 patients 
      each were randomly assigned to the three different extracorporeal membrane 
      oxygenation systems. Exclusion criteria were acute renal failure, trauma, and 
      surgery within 2 days. The median time on veno-venous extracorporeal membrane 
      oxygenation support was 13.5 days (4-70 d). Median platelet count had dropped 
      from 220.5 G/L before extracorporeal membrane oxygenation therapy to a minimum of 
      133 G/L by the last day of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support. During 
      the first 5 days of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation therapy, prothrombin 
      fragment 1.2 (F1.2) (1.36-2.4 µM), thrombin-antithrombin complex (14.5-50 µg/L), 
      and D-dimers (6.00-27.0 mg/L) increased, whereas fibrinogen values dropped from 
      5.8 to 4.1 g/L. The three different extracorporeal membrane oxygenation systems 
      did not show any differences with regard to hemostasis, anticoagulation, 
      hemolysis, and inflammatory parameters within the first 5 days of extracorporeal 
      membrane oxygenation therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Over time, miniaturized veno-venous 
      extracorporeal membrane oxygenation therapy increasingly activates coagulation. 
      The different types of membrane oxygenators and pumps did not significantly alter 
      hemostasis.

TI  - Effects of Interaction Between Ventricular Assist Device Assistance and 
      Autoregulated Mock Circulation Including Frank-Starling Mechanism and Baroreflex.
PG  - 981-991
LID - 10.1111/aor.12635 [doi]
AB  - A mock heart circulation loop (MHCL) is a hydraulic model simulating the human 
      circulatory system. It allows in vitro investigations of the interaction between 
      cardiac assist devices and the human circulatory system. In this study, a preload 
      sensitive MHCL, the MHCL(AUTO) , was developed to investigate the interaction 
      between the left ventricle and left ventricular assist devices (LVADs). The 
      Frank-Starling mechanism was modeled by regulating the stroke volume (SV) based 
      on the measured mean diastolic left atrial pressure (MLAP(diast) ). The 
      baroreflex autoregulation mechanism was implemented to maintain a constant mean 
      aortic pressure (MAP) by varying ventricular contractility (E(max) ), heart rate 
      (HR), afterload/systemic vascular resistance (SVR) and unstressed venous volume 
      (UVV). The DP3 blood pump (Medos Medizintechnik GmbH) was used to simulate the 
      LVAD. Characteristic parameters were measured in pathological conditions both 
      with and without LVAD to assess the hemodynamic effect of LVAD on the MHCL(AUTO) 
      . The results obtained from the MHCL(AUTO) show a high correlation to literature 
      data. The study demonstrates the possibility of using the MHCL(AUTO) as a 
      research tool to better understand the physiological interactions between cardiac 
      implants and human circulation.

TI  - Does Flexible Arterial Tubing Retain More Hemodynamic Energy During Pediatric 
      Pulsatile Extracorporeal Life Support?
PG  - 47-54

AB  - The objective of this study was to evaluate the hemodynamic performance and 
      energy transmission of flexible arterial tubing as the arterial line in a 
      simulated pediatric pulsatile extracorporeal life support (ECLS) system. The ECLS 
      circuit consisted of a Medos Deltastream DP3 diagonal pump head, Medos Hilite 
      2400 LT oxygenator, Biomedicus arterial/venous cannula (10 Fr/14 Fr), 3 feet of 
      polyvinyl chloride (PVC) arterial tubing or latex rubber arterial tubing, primed 
      with lactated Ringer's solution and packed red blood cells (hematocrit 40%). 
      Trials were conducted at flow rates of 300 to 1200 mL/min (300 mL/min increments) 
      under nonpulsatile and pulsatile modes at 36°C using either PVC arterial tubing 
      (PVC group) or latex rubber tubing (Latex group). Real-time pressure and flow 
      data were recorded using a custom-based data acquisition system. Mean pressures 
      and energy equivalent pressures (EEP) were the same under nonpulsatile mode 
      between the two groups. Under pulsatile mode, EEPs were significantly great than 
      mean pressure, especially in the Latex group (P < 0.05). There was no difference 
      between the two groups with regards to pressure drops across ECLS circuit, but 
      pulsatile flow created more pressure drops than nonpulsatile flow (P < 0.05). 
      Surplus hemodynamic energy (SHE) levels were always higher in the Latex group 
      than in the PVC group at all sites. Although total hemodynamic energy (THE) 
      losses were higher under pulsatile mode compared to nonpulsatile mode, more THE 
      was delivered to the pseudopatient, particularly in the Latex group (P < 0.05). 
      The results showed that the flexible arterial tubing retained more hemodynamic 
      energy passing through it under pulsatile mode while mean pressures and pressure 
      drops across the ECLS circuit were similar between PVC and latex rubber arterial 
      tubing. Further studies are warranted to verify our findings.

TI  - Use of a novel diagonal pump in an in vitro neonatal pulsatile extracorporeal 
      life support circuit.
PG  - E1-9
LID - 10.1111/aor.12240 [doi]
AB  - One approach with the potential to improve morbidity and mortality rates 
      following extracorporeal life support (ECLS) is the use of pulsatile perfusion. 
      Currently, no ECLS pumps used in the United States can produce pulsatile flow. 
      The objective of this experiment is to evaluate a novel diagonal pump used in 
      Europe to determine whether it provides physiological pulsatility in a neonatal 
      model. The ECLS circuit consisted of a Medos Deltastream DP3 diagonal pump, a 
      Hilite 800LT polymethylpentene diffusion membrane oxygenator, and arterial/venous 
      tubing. A 300-mL pseudopatient was connected to the circuit using an 8Fr arterial 
      cannula and a 10Fr venous cannula. A clamp maintained constant pressure entering 
      the pseudopatient. Trials (64 total) were conducted in nonpulsatile and pulsatile 
      modes at flow rates of 200 mL/min to 800 mL/min. Flow and pressure data were 
      collected using a custom-based data acquisition system. The Deltastream DP3 pump 
      was capable of producing an adequate quality of pulsatility. Pulsatile flow 
      produced increased mean arterial pressure, energy equivalent pressure (EEP), and 
      surplus hemodynamic energy (SHE) at all flow rates compared to nonpulsatile flow. 
      Pressure drop across the cannula accounted for the majority of pressure loss in 
      the circuit. The greatest loss of SHE and total hemodynamic energy occurred 
      across the arterial cannula due to its small diameter. The Deltastream DP3 pump 
      produced physiological pulsatile flow without backflow while providing EEP and 
      SHE to our neonatal pseudopatient. Further experiments are necessary to determine 
      the impact of this pulsatile pump in an in vivo model prior to clinical use.
