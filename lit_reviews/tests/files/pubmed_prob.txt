TI  - Esophageal Protection and Temperature Monitoring Using the Circa S-Cath™ 
      Temperature Probe during Epicardial Radiofrequency Ablation of the Pulmonary 
      Veins and Posterior Left Atrium.

AB  - Although epicardial bipolar radiofrequency ablation should diminish the risk of 
      esophageal thermal injury in comparison to an endocardial ablation, cases of 
      lethal atrio-esophageal fistula have been reported. To better understand this 
      risk and to reduce the possibility of a thermal injury, we monitored the 
      esophageal temperature with the Circa S-Cath™ temperature probe during and 
      immediately after the ablation while implementing three procedural safety 
      measures. Twenty patients (15 males; 63 ± 10 years) were prospectively enrolled 
      (November 2019-February 2021). All patients underwent an epicardial ablation 
      procedure, including an antral left and right pulmonary vein isolation with 
      bidirectional bipolar clamping, and a roof and inferior line using unidirectional 
      bipolar radiofrequency. Three procedural preventive mitigations were implemented: 
      (1) transesophageal echocardiographic visualization of the atrio-esophageal 
      interface, with probe retraction before the energy delivery; (2) lifting the 
      ablated tissue away from the esophagus during an energy application; and (3) a 30 
      s cool-off and irrigation period after the energy delivery. The esophageal 
      temperature was recorded using an insulated multisensory intraluminal esophageal 
      temperature probe (Circa S-Cath™). Of the 20 patients enrolled, 7 patients had 
      paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AF), 8 persistent AF and 5 longstanding 
      persistent AF. The average maximum luminal esophageal temperature observed was 
      36.2 ± 0.7 °C (34.8-38.2 °C). In our clinical experience, no abrupt increase in 
      the luminal esophageal temperature above the baseline was observed. Since no 
      measurements exceeded the threshold of 39 °C, no prompt interruption of energy 
      delivery was required. Intraluminal esophageal temperature monitoring is feasible 
      and can be helpful in confirming correct catheter position and safe energy 
      application in bipolar epicardial left atrial ablation. Intra-procedural 
      preventive mitigations should be implemented to reduce the risk of esophageal 
      temperature rises.

AB  - Intraoperative temperature monitoring of surgical patients is an important aspect 
      of perioperative care. Central core temperature monitoring is often accomplished 
      using an 18 French esophageal device inserted through the mouth into the 
      esophagus, while patients are undergoing general anesthesia. Placement of a 
      modified esophageal temperature probe (i.e. with the protective plastic covering 
      removed) into the nasopharynx of a patient may cause significant patient harm by 
      injuring the nasal mucosa and/or turbinates. An internal survey of current 
      practice at our academic institution reveals that 78% of anesthesia providers 
      modify the esophageal temperature probes, leading to an 11% injury incidence. A 
      practical solution to avoid complications is to place a pediatric size 9 French 
      esophageal temperature probe into the nasopharynx to monitor the central core 
      temperature.

TI  - Perioperative targeted temperature management of severely burned patients by 
      means of an oesophageal temperature probe.
PG  - 401-407
LID - S0305-4179(22)00066-3 [pii]

AB  - BACKGROUND: Hypothermia in severely burned patients is associated with a 
      significant increase in morbidity and mortality. The use of an oesophageal heat 
      exchanger tube (EHT) can improve perioperative body temperatures in severely 
      burned patients. The aim of this study was to investigate the intraoperative 
      warming effect of oesophageal heat transfer in severe burn patients. METHODS: 
      Single-centre retrospective study performed at the Burns Centre of the University 
      Hospital Zurich. Between January 2020 and May 2021 perioperative temperature 
      management with EHT was explored in burned patients with a total body surface 
      area (TBSA) larger than 30%. Data from patients, who received perioperative 
      temperature management by EHT, were compared to data from the same patients 
      during interventions performed under standard temperature management matching for 
      length and type of intervention. RESULTS: A total of 30 interventions (15 with 
      and 15 without EHT) in 10 patients were analysed. Patient were 38 [26-48] years 
      of age, presented with severe burns covering a median of 50 [42-64] % TBSA and 
      were characterized by an ABSI of 10 [8-12] points. When receiving EHT management 
      patients experienced warming at 0.07 °C per minute (4.2 °C/h) compared to a 
      temperature loss of - 0.03 °C per minute (1.8 °C/h) when only receiving standard 
      temperature management (p < 0.0001). No adverse or serious adverse events were 
      reported. CONCLUSION: The use of an oesophageal heat transfer device was 
      effective and safe in providing perioperative warming to severely burned patients 
      when compared to a standard temperature management protocol. By employing an EHT 
      as primary temperature management device perioperative hypothermia in severely 
      burned patients can possibly be averted, potentially leading to reduced 
      hypothermia-associated complications.

      bypass: a prospective observational study.
LID - ezad242 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/ejcts/ezad242 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Core temperature monitoring is critical during cardiopulmonary bypass 
      (CPB). In this prospective observational study, we investigated the performance 
      of the transoesophageal echocardiography (TOE) probe for core (oesophageal) 
      temperature monitoring during CPB. METHODS: Thirty adult patients, 18-70 years of 
      either gender, undergoing cardiac surgery with CPB were enrolled. All patients 
      received a reusable nasopharyngeal probe for monitoring core temperatures. In 
      addition, the oesophageal temperatures were monitored with the TOE probe. The 
      arterial outlet temperatures at the membrane oxygenator were also monitored and 
      taken as the reference standard. Monitoring was performed every 5 min until 
      20 min, and then at 30 min during both the cooling and rewarming periods. 
      RESULTS: During cooling, the oesophageal and nasopharyngeal temperatures lagged 
      behind the arterial outlet temperatures. However, the intra-class correlation of 
      the oesophageal temperatures with the arterial outlet temperatures was better 
      (range 0.58-0.74) than the correlation of the nasopharyngeal temperatures with 
      the arterial outlet temperatures (range 0.46-0.62). During rewarming, the 
      performance of the TOE probe was significantly superior to the nasopharyngeal 
      probe. After 15 and 20 min of rewarming, there was a difference of ∼1°C between 
      the oesophageal and nasopharyngeal temperatures. At 30 min of rewarming, the 
      oesophageal and the arterial outlet temperatures were similar, while the 
      nasopharyngeal temperatures still lagged by 0.5°C. Bias was significantly less 
      both during cooling and warming between the oesophageal temperatures and arterial 
      outlet temperatures. CONCLUSIONS: Performance of the TOE probe as an oesophageal 
      temperature probe is superior to the nasopharyngeal probe during CPB. CLINICAL

TI  - Evaluation of the Temple Touch Pro™ noninvasive core-temperature monitoring 
      system in 100 adults under general anesthesia: a prospective comparison with 
      esophageal temperature.
PG  - 29-36
LID - 10.1007/s10877-022-00851-z [doi]
AB  - Perioperative hypothermia is still common and has relevant complication for the 
      patient. An effective perioperative thermal management requires essentially an 
      accurate method to measure core temperature. So far, only one study has 
      investigated the new Temple Touch Pro™ (Medisim Ltd., Beit-Shemesh, Israel). 
      during anesthesia Therefore, we assessed the agreement between the Temple Touch 
      Pro™ thermometer (TTP) and distal esophageal temperature (T(Eso)) in a second 
      study. After approval by the local ethics committee we studied 100 adult patients 
      undergoing surgery with general anesthesia. Before induction of anesthesia the 
      TTP sensor unit was attached to the skin above the temporal artery. After 
      induction of anesthesia an esophageal temperature probe was placed in the distal 
      esophagus. Recordings started 10 min after placement of the esophageal 
      temperature probe to allow adequate warming of the probes. Pairs of temperature 
      values were documented in five-minute intervals until emergence of anesthesia. 
      Accuracy of the two methods was assessed by Bland-Altman comparisons of 
      differences with multiple measurements. Core temperatures obtained with the TTP 
      in adults showed a mean bias of -0.04 °C with 95% limits of agreement within 
      - 0.99 °C to + 0.91 °C compared to an esophageal temperature probe. We consider 
      the TTP as a reasonable tool for perioperative temperature monitoring. It is not 
      accurate enough to be used as a reference method in scientific studies, but may 
      be a useful tool especially for conscious patients undergoing neuraxial 
      anesthesia or regional anesthesia with sedation. Trial registration This study 
      was registered in the German Clinical Trials Register (DRKS-ID: 00024050), day of 
      registration 12/01/2021.

TI  - Evaluation of the non-invasive Temple Touch Pro temperature monitoring system 
      compared with oesophageal temperature in paediatric anaesthesia (PETER PAN): A 
      prospective observational study.
PG  - 198-207
LID - 10.1097/EJA.0000000000001796 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Monitoring peri-operative body temperature in children is currently 
      mainly achieved through invasive devices. The Temple Touch Pro Temperature 
      Monitoring System estimates core temperature noninvasively based on heat flux 
      thermometry. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the agreement of this noninvasive sensor 
      against standard oesophageal core temperature. DESIGN: A prospective 
      observational study. SETTING: University hospital recruiting between April and 
      July 2021. PATIENTS: One hundred children (32 girls) aged 6 years or younger 
      scheduled for noncardiac surgery, resulting in 6766 data pairs. Exclusion 
      criteria were contraindication for the insertion of an oesophageal temperature 
      probe, and procedures in which one of the measurement methods would interfere 
      with the surgical field. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcome was the agreement 
      analysis by a Bland-Altman comparison with multiple measurements. Posthoc, we 
      performed another agreement analysis after exclusion of a statistically 
      determined equilibration time. Secondary outcomes were the temperature 
      differences over time and subgroup analysis of hypothermic, normothermic and 
      hyperthermic temperature ranges, age, sex and sensor's side by type III analysis 
      of variance. Further, we correlated the sonographically determined depth of the 
      artery with trueness. RESULTS: The mean difference was -0.07°C (95% CI -0.15 to 
      +0.05) with limits of agreement of -1.00 and +0.85°C. After adjusting for an 
      equilibration time of 13 min, the mean difference improved to -0.04°C (95% CI 
      -0.08 to +0.01) with limits of agreement of -0.68 and +0.60°C. Concordance 
      correlation coefficient was 0.83 (95% CI 0.82 to 0.84). Differences between the 
      skin sensor and oesophageal reference increased over time by -0.05°C per hour. 
      Subgroup analysis showed no clinically relevant differences. Depth of artery 
      negatively correlated with trueness by 0.03°C per millimetre. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Although the Temple Touch Pro sensor showed acceptable accuracy after allowing 
      for an equilibration time, it still needs further investigation for routine use 
      in children. This particularly affects accuracy in hypothermic ranges, imprecise 
      positioning and applicability in children with immature or vulnerable skin. TRIAL

AB  - The purpose of the study was to characterize exercise induced arterial hypoxemia 
      (EIAH) in female masters athletes (FMA). We hypothesized that FMA would 
      experience EIAH during treadmill running. Eight FMA (48-57 years) completed 
      pulmonary function testing and an incremental exercise test until exhaustion 
      (V̇O(2)max⁡ = 45.7 ± 6.5, range:35-54 ml/kg/min). On a separate day, the 
      participants were instrumented with a radial arterial catheter and an esophageal 
      temperature probe. Participants performed three to four constant load exercise 
      tests at 60-70 %, 75 %, 90 %, 95 %, and 100 % of maximal oxygen uptake while 
      sampling arterial blood and recording esophageal temperature. We found that FMA 
      decrease their partial pressure of oxygen (86.0 ± 7.6, range:73-108 mmHg), 
      arterial saturation (96.2 ± 1.2, range:93-98 %), and widen their alveolar to 
      arterial oxygen difference (23.2 ± 8.8, range:5-42 mmHg) during all exercise 
      intensities however, with variability in terms of severity and pattern. Our 
      findings suggest that FMA experience EIAH however aerobic fitness appears 
      unrelated to occurrence or severity (r = 0.13, p = 0.756).

TI  - Non-Invasive Monitoring of Core Body Temperature for Targeted Temperature 
      Management in Post-Cardiac Arrest Care.
PG  - 810825
LID - 10.3389/fmed.2022.810825 [doi]
LID - 810825
AB  - IMPORTANCE: Accurate monitoring of core body temperature is integral to targeted 
      temperature management (TTM) following cardiac arrest. However, there are no 
      reliable non-invasive methods for monitoring temperature during TTM. OBJECTIVES: 
      We compared the accuracy and precision of a novel non-invasive Zero-Heat-Flux 
      Thermometer (SpotOn™) to a standard invasive esophageal probe in a cohort of 
      patients undergoing TTM post-cardiac arrest. DESIGN SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: We 
      prospectively enrolled 20 patients undergoing post-cardiac arrest care in the 
      intensive care units at the London Health Sciences Centre in London, Canada. A 
      SpotOn™ probe was applied on each patient's forehead, while an esophageal 
      temperature probe was inserted, and both temperature readings were recorded at 
      1-min intervals for the duration of TTM. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: We compared 
      the SpotOn™ and esophageal monitors using the Bland-Altman analysis and the 
      Pearson correlation, with accuracy set as a primary outcome. Secondary outcomes 
      included precision and correlation. Bias exceeding 0.1°C and limits of agreement 
      exceeding 0.5°C were considered clinically important. RESULTS: Sixteen (80%) of 
      patients had complete data used in the final analysis. The median (interquartile 
      range) duration of recording was 38 (12-56) h. Compared to the esophageal probe, 
      SpotOn™ had a bias of 0.06 ± 0.45°C and 95% limits of agreement of -0.83 to 
      0.95°C. The Pearson correlation coefficient was 0.97 (95% confidence interval 
      0.9663-0.9678), with a two-tailed p < 0.0001. CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE: The 
      SpotOn™ is an accurate method that may enable non-invasive monitoring of core 
      body temperature during TTM, although its precision is slightly worse than the 
      predefined 0.5°C when compared to invasive esophageal probe.

TI  - Optimal Positioning of Nasopharyngeal Temperature Probes in Infants and Children: 
      A Prospective Cohort Study.
PG  - 986-991
LID - 10.1213/ANE.0000000000006312 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The nasopharynx is an easily accessible core-temperature monitoring 
      site, but insufficient or excessive nasopharyngeal probe insertion can 
      underestimate core temperature. Our goal was to estimate optimal nasopharyngeal 
      probe insertion depth as a function of age. METHODS: We enrolled 157 pediatric 
      patients who had noncardiac surgery with endotracheal intubation in 5 groups: (1) 
      newborn to 6 months old, (2) infants 7 months to 1 year old, (3) children 13 to 
      23 months old, (4) children 2 to 5 years old, and (5) children 6 to 12 years old. 
      A reference esophageal temperature probe was inserted at an appropriate depth 
      based on each patient's height. A nasopharyngeal temperature probe was inserted 
      from the naris at 10 cm in newborn and infants, 15 cm in children aged 1 to 5 
      years old, and 20 cm in children who were 6 years or older. The study 
      nasopharyngeal probes were withdrawn 1, 2.5, or 2 cm (depending on age) 10 times 
      at 5-minute intervals. Optimal probe insertion distances were defined by limits 
      of agreement (LOAs) between nasopharyngeal and esophageal temperatures <0.5 °C. 
      RESULTS: Optimal nasopharyngeal temperature probe position ranged from 6 to 10 cm 
      in infants up to 6 months old, 7 to 8 cm in infants 7 to 12 months old, 7.5 to 12 
      cm in children 13 to 23 months old, and 10 to 12 cm in children aged 6 years and 
      older. The 95% LOAs were <0.5 °C for all age categories except the 2- to 
      5-year-old group where the limits extended from -0.67 °C to 0.52 °C at 9 cm. At 
      the optimal position within each age range, the bias (average 
      nasopharyngeal-to-esophageal temperature difference) was ≤0.1 °C. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Nasopharyngeal thermometers accurately measure core temperature, but only when 
      probes are inserted a proper distance, which varies with age. As with much in 
      pediatrics, nasopharyngeal thermometer insertion depths should be age 
      appropriate.

TI  - Relationship between the posterior atrial wall and the esophagus: esophageal 
      position and temperature measurement during atrial fibrillation ablation 
      (AWESOME-AF). A randomized controlled trial.
PG  - 651-661
LID - 10.1007/s10840-022-01302-0 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) implies unavoidable ablation lesions 
      to the left atrial posterior wall, which is closely related to the esophagus, 
      leading to several potential complications. This study evaluates the usefulness 
      of the esophageal fingerprint in avoiding temperature rises during paroxysmal 
      atrial fibrillation (PAF) ablation. METHODS: Isodistance maps of the 
      atrio-esophageal relationship (esophageal fingerprint) were derived from the 
      preprocedural computerized tomography. Patients were randomized (1:1) into two 
      groups: (1) PRINT group, the PVI line was modified according to the esophageal 
      fingerprint; (2) CONTROL group, standard PVI with operator blinded to the 
      fingerprint. The primary endpoint was temperature rise detected by intraluminal 
      esophageal temperature probe monitoring. Ablation settings were as specified on 
      the Ablate BY-LAW study protocol. RESULTS: Sixty consecutive patients referred 
      for paroxysmal AF ablation were randomized (42 (70%) men, mean age 
      60 ± 11 years). Temperature rise (> 39.1 °C) occurred in 5 (16%) patients in the 
      PRINT group vs. 17 (56%) in the CONTROL group (p < 0.01). Three AF recurrences 
      were documented at a mean follow-up of 12 ± 3 months (one (3%) in the PRINT group 
      and 2 (6.6%) in the CONTROL group, p = 0.4). CONCLUSION: The esophageal 
      fingerprint allows for a reliable identification of the esophageal position and 
      its use for PVI line deployment results in less frequent esophageal temperature 
      rises when compared to the standard approach. Further studies are needed to 
      evaluate the impact of PVI line modification to avoid esophageal heating on 
      long-term outcomes. The development of new imaging-derived tools could ultimately 
      improve patient safety (NCT04394923).

AB  - BACKGROUND: The search for a less invasive and lower cost cryoballoon-based 
      strategy for atrial fibrillation (AF) ablation has resulted in a simplified 
      procedure that may be suitable for cryoballoon ablation (CBA). Here, we compared 
      procedural characteristics and outcomes between conventional CBA and simple CBA. 
      METHODS: We enrolled 628 consecutive patients who underwent initial CBA for AF 
      (age, 69 ± 12 years; female, 263 (42%); paroxysmal AF, 576 (92%); 
      CHA(2)DS(2)-VASc score, 2.7 ± 1.6 points). Simple CBA was characterized by the 
      minimal procedure required to isolate pulmonary veins, including the following: 
      (1) CBA was performed without guidance from a 3-D mapping system; (2) a coronary 
      sinus electrode and esophageal temperature probe were not used; (3) a waiting 
      period after pulmonary vein isolation was not set; and AF induction by 
      isoproterenol and atrial burst stimuli were not performed. RESULTS: Simple CBA 
      was performed in 240 (38%) patients. Procedural time (49 ± 18 versus 85 ± 27 min, 
      p < 0.01) was shorter, and total procedural costs (20,699 ± 8,091 versus 
      30,350 ± 11,647 US dollars, p < 0.01) were lower with simple CBA than 
      conventional CBA. Freedom from AF recurrence during the 12-month study period 
      (79.8% versus 78.4%, p = 0.52) and complication rate (8.8% versus 13.1%, 
      p = 0.09) were similar between the two groups. CONCLUSION: Compared with 
      conventional CBA, simple CBA reduced procedural time and procedural costs while 
      providing comparable outcomes.

TI  - Catheter ablation of atrial fibrillation with a multi-electrode radiofrequency

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The Heliostar™ ablation system is a novel RF balloon ablation 
      technology with an integrated three-dimensional mapping system. Here, we describe 
      our early experience and procedural outcomes using this technology for atrial 
      fibrillation catheter ablation. METHODS: We sought to comprehensively assess the 
      first 60 consecutive patients undergoing pulmonary vein isolation using the novel 
      HELISOTAR™ RF balloon technology including procedural outcomes. A comparison of 
      the workflow between two different anaesthetic modalities (conscious sedation 
      [CS] vs. general anaesthesia [GA]) was made. Procedural data were collected 
      prospectively from two high-volume centers (Barts Heart Centre, UK and University 
      Hospital of Zurich, Zurich). A standardized approach for catheter ablation was 
      employed. RESULTS: A total of 35 patients had the procedure under CS and the 
      remaining under GA. Mean procedural and fluoroscopy times were 84 ± 33 min and 
      1.1 min. The median duration of RF energy application was 7 (5-9.8) mins per 
      patient. All veins were successfully isolated, and the median isolation time was 
      10 (7-15) seconds. Our cohort's rate of procedural complications was low, with no 
      mortality within 30 days postprocedure. CONCLUSION: Our early experience shows 
      that catheter ablation using the Heliostar™ technology can be performed 
      efficiently and safely; however, long-term data is yet to be established. Low 
      fluoroscopy requirements, short learning curves and use of this technology with 
      CS is possible, including the use of an oesophageal temperature probe.

TI  - Critically buried avalanche victims can develop severe hypothermia in less than 
      60 min.
PG  - 29
LID - 10.1186/s13049-023-01092-y [doi]
LID - 29
AB  - BACKGROUND: A major challenge in the management of avalanche victims in cardiac 
      arrest is differentiating hypothermic from non-hypothermic cardiac arrest, as 
      management and prognosis differ. Duration of burial with a cutoff of 60 min is 
      currently recommended by the resuscitation guidelines as a parameter to aid in 
      this differentiation However, the fastest cooling rate under the snow reported so 
      far is 9.4 °C per hour, suggesting that it would take 45 min to cool below 30 °C, 
      which is the temperature threshold below which a hypothermic cardiac arrest can 
      occur. CASE PRESENTATION: We describe a case with a cooling rate of 14 °C per 
      hour, assessed on site with an oesophageal temperature probe. This is by far the 
      most rapid cooling rate after critical avalanche burial reported in the 
      literature and further challenges the recommended 60 min threshold for triage 
      decisions. The patient was transported under continuous mechanical CPR to an ECLS 
      facility and rewarmed with VA-ECMO, although his HOPE score was 3% only. After 
      three days he developed brain death and became an organ donor. CONCLUSIONS: With 
      this case we would like to underline three important aspects: first, whenever 
      possible, core body temperature should be used instead of burial duration to make 
      triage decisions. Second, the HOPE score, which is not well validated for 
      avalanche victims, had a good discriminatory ability in our case. Third, although 
      extracorporeal rewarming was futile for the patient, he donated his organs. Thus, 
      even if the probability of survival of a hypothermic avalanche patient is low 
      based on the HOPE score, ECLS should not be withheld by default and the 
      possibility of organ donation should be considered.
