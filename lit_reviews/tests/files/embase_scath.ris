N2  - BACKGROUND: The cryoballoon (CB) represents the gold standard single-shot device for pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). Single-shot pulsed field PVI ablation (nonthermal, cardiac tissue selective) has recently entered the arena. We sought to compare procedural data and long-term outcome of both techniques. METHODS: Consecutive AF patients who underwent pulsed field ablation (PFA) and CB-based PVI were enrolled. CB PVI was performed using the second-generation 28-mm CB; PFA was performed using a 31/35-mm pentaspline catheter. Success was defined as freedom from atrial tachyarrhythmia after a 3-month blanking period. RESULTS: Four hundred patients were included (56.5% men; 60.8% paroxysmal AF; age 70 [interquartile range, 59-77] years), 200 in each group (CB and PFA), and baseline characteristics did not differ. Acute PVI was achieved in 100% of PFA and in 98% (196/200) of CB patients (P=0.123; 4 touch-up ablations). Median procedure time was significantly shorter in PFA (34.5 [29-40] minutes) versus CB (50 [45-60] minutes; P<0.001), fluoroscopy time was similar. Overall procedural complications were 6.5% in CB and 3.0% in PFA (P=0.1), driven by a higher rate of phrenic nerve palsies using CB. The 1-year success rates in paroxysmal AF (CB, 83.1%; PFA, 80.3%; P=0.724) and persistent AF (CB, 71%; PFA, 66.8%; P=0.629) were similar for both techniques. CONCLUSIONS: PFA compared with CB PVI shows a similar procedural efficacy but is associated with shorter procedure time and no phrenic nerve palsies. Importantly, 12-month clinical success rates are favorable but not different between both groups.

N2  - Background The prevalence of non-Alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is increasing in the USA. Some of these patients develop non-Alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), which can progress to cirrhosis. Ultrasound imaging is one of the most used modalities for diagnosing hepatic steatosis. Primary care providers are increasingly using point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS), which could increase the number of subjects diagnosed with NAFLD. This study evaluates the accuracy of POCUS in identifying patients with NASH. Methods Patients with hepatic steatosis without excess alcohol intake or other liver diseases undergoing liver biopsy were included in this study. These patients underwent POCUS and vibration-controlled transient elastography (VCTE) evaluations within 3months of a liver biopsy. A comparison of POCUS data with liver histology and VCTE were made to assess the validity of POCUS evaluation in diagnosing NAFLD and NASH. Results The steatosis score from the liver histology had a low correlation with the controlled attenuation parameter score from VCTE (r=0.27) and a moderate correlation with the grade of steatosis detected by the POCUS exam (r=0.57). The NAFLD activity score on histology was found to correlate with the ultrasonographic fatty liver index (USFLI) from the POCUS exam (r=0.59). A USFLI≥6 diagnosed NASH with a sensitivity of 81%, and a value of ≤3 ruled out the diagnosis of NASH with a sensitivity of 100%. Conclusion The provider can use the POCUS exam in clinical practice to diagnose NAFLD and reliably stratify patients who have NASH.

N2  - Clinical Information Patient Initials or Identifier Number: BG 4∗∗-2022 Relevant Clinical History and Physical Exam: A 69-year-old woman with hypertension and dyslipidemia with no history of heart disease is described. Her cardiac history started in 2010 with anterior STEMI treated with angioplasty and stent placement on mid LAD. In 2011 she was recovered for unstable angina that was treated with two stents. Her basal ECG demonstrate transmural anterior necrosis and her cardiac echo shows apical akinesia with EF 48%. Because of the onset of intensive chest pain at rest she came to our emergency department. [Formula presented] [Formula presented] Relevant Test Results Prior to Catheterization: At admission in ER her ECG and eco were unchanged compared to the previous exams and her thoracic X-ray (Fig.3) was normal. She had increasing cardiac markers, particularly her TnI-HS, which reached 788 pg/mL at her second test. She was admitted in cardiology department and coronary angiography was scheduled for the next morning. During the night she was completely asymptomatic without further increase in cardiac markers and new ECG changes. [Formula presented] Relevant Catheterization Findings: Coronarography from the femoral artery (Fig. 4) demonstrated RCA and LAD free of stenosis and doubtful stenoses at proximal and mid LCX. At OCT (Fig. 5) both stenoses on LCX were critical while the left main was normal. GuideLiner enabled us to pre-dilate the stenoses on LCX and we placed a long 3,0 x 38 mm Zotarolimus eluting stent obtaining good angiographic results (Fig. 6). The final OCT wasn't performed because of an inability to pass with the probe the proximal stent edge. [Formula presented] [Formula presented] [Formula presented] Interventional Management Procedural Step: A few minutes later she complained of chest pain with anterior ST depressions and ST elevation in aVR. The patient was transferred to the cath lab where the invasive pressure was 30/10 mmHg and the angio showed LM occlusion (Fig 7. A-C). With the passage of the guidewire the flow was restored, and blood pressure rose to 85/40 mmHg (Fig. 7. D, E). Direct stenting of the LM 3,5 x 22 mm and mid LAD 3,0 x 22 mm was done (Fig. 7. F-H). Procedure was followed by POT, struts POBA toward LCX, kissing balloon and re-POT (Fig. 7. I-L) with good angio result but with LM dissection at proximal edge of the stent, confirmed by IVUS (Fig. 8. A, B). A third stent 5,0 x 12 mm was placed at the LM ostium in overlapping with the previous one (Fig. 8. C) with excellent angiographic and IVUS result (Fig. 8. D, E). All stents were Zotarolimus eluting. The patient was then transferred in CCU with normal blood pressure, free of pain, but dyspneic. ECG was without ST changes, while at X-ray pulmonary oedema was present, the FE was 35%, significantly reduced compared to the basal exam (Fig. 9. A-C) and the troponin TnI-HS rose to 25453 pg/mL. Treatment with CPAP, diuretics, antibiotics, DAPT, low dose vasodilators and beta-blockers and high dose statins was effective. At the 5th day, the patient was discharged asymptomatic, and his X-ray, ECG and echo were comparable to those taken on admission (Fig. 9. D-F). [Formula presented] [Formula presented] [Formula presented] Conclusions: Our case clearly demonstrates that sometimes even well-planned procedures with imaging can lead to life-threatening complications. In managing such devastating situations where time is of the essence for the patient's salvation and reducing organ damage, the key is the organized and synchronized behaviour of all personnel. Crucial is the operator's experience in confronting and successfully treating such dramatic situations.

N2  - Background Atrial fibrillation (AF) ablation (abl) procedures have traditionally been performed with fluoroscopy to guide with catheter (cath) insertion and transseptal access. We present our institutional protocol for zero fluoroscopy AF abl using intracardiac echocardiography (ICE) and 3D mapping technology with immediate outcomes of the first 130 consecutive patients. Methods After access is obtained under general anesthesia, a decapolar deflectable cath and ICE cath are advanced from the femoral vein to the right atrium. Using 3D mapping and ICE guidance, the decapolar cath is inserted into the coronary sinus for anatomical referencing and pacing. A temperature probe is secured to a decapolar mapping cath and inserted into the esophagus for localization under 3D mapping. ICE imaging is used to visualize passage of guide wires to the SVC, double transseptal sheath/BRK1 needle caudal drag and tenting of the interatrial septum. An ultrasonographic and 3D anatomical shell of the left atrium is created with CARTO (Biosense Webster) using a high-density mapping cath (LASSO or PENTARAY). Abl is performed using the Smart Touch SF abl cath and pulmonary vein antral isolation (PVAI) confirmed with voltage remapping and exit block; additional abl performed as required per patient. Results 130 patients (75 male, 55 females; mean age 65) underwent initial abl for AF at our institution. In patients who underwent PVAI alone, procedure time (access initiation to sheath removal) ranged from 68 to 185 minutes (median 130 minutes); in patients who required further abl for flutter, atrial tachycardia, posterior wall abl, or SVC abl, median time was 138 minutes (range of 81 to 241 minutes). All patients had confirmed persistent vein isolation on voltage remapping. One patient developed a pericardial effusion requiring only pericardiocentesis, no other complications observed. Conclusion Complete avoidance of radiation exposure for both patient and the electrophysiology personnel, as well as all standard procedural endpoints can be achieved routinely and safely during zero-fluoroscopy AF abl. This technique can be offered to a broad range of patients including pregnant, young and elderly patients.

N2  - Background Completely fluoroless atrial fibrillation (AF) ablation is feasible using electroanatomical guidance and intracardiac echocardiography (ICE). One of the important safety measures is continuous esophageal temperature monitoring to avoid significant temperature changes which can cause injury. A multipoint temperature probe monitors a large surface area, however, confirmation of proper positioning traditionally required the use of fluoroscopy. Methods We have developed a fluoroless method to insert and monitor proper placement of a multipoint esophageal temperature probe (Circa S-Cath), using ICE and the temperature data from the probe itself - temperature differential in the posterior mediastinum due to proximity of the airways (step-down sign). Results During the 14 months of the study, 93 consecutive patients underwent esophageal temperature monitoring during AF ablation with the fluoroless technique: age 61+-12 years, height 152-196 cm, weight 44-190 kg, body mass index 33.3+-7.6 kg/m2; 11% had prior endoscopic or open chest/mediastinal surgeries. The esophagus was visualized on ICE in 97%, the probe insertion was seen in 74%. The temperature step-down sign was seen in 100% of the cases. All initial and following temperature changes during ablation were bracketed by the multipoint temperature sensors. All planned lesion sets were successfully completed in each patient: radiofrequency pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) 84%, cryo PVI 15%, posterior left atrial wall isolation 1%. No complications were encountered. Conclusion Multipoint esophageal temperature monitoring is feasible during AF ablation, using a completely fluoroless technique. The workflow uses equipment and methods already utilized during the ablation procedure. The temperature step-down sign was observed in every case and confirmed proper probe placement with adequate coverage to guide safe lesion delivery in a wide range of body habitus.

N2  - Background: Nerve entrapment has been hypothesized to contribute to the multicausal etiology of axonopathy in sensorimotor diabetic neuropathy. Targeted surgical decompression reduces external strain on the affected nerve and, therefore, may alleviate symptoms, including pain and sensory dysfunction. However, its therapeutic value in this cohort remains unclear. Aim: Quantifying the treatment effect of targeted lower extremity nerve decompression in patients with preexisting painful sensorimotor diabetic neuropathy and nerve entrapment on pain intensity, sensory function, motor function, and neural signal conduction. Study design: This prospective, controlled trial studies 40 patients suffering from bilateral therapy-refractory, painful (n = 20, visual analogue scale, VAS ≥ 5) or painless (n = 20, VAS = 0) sensorimotor diabetic neuropathy with clinical and/or radiologic signs of focal lower extremity nerve compression who underwent unilateral surgical nerve decompression of the common peroneal and the tibial nerve. Tissue biopsies will be analyzed to explore perineural tissue remodeling in correlation with intraoperatively measured nerve compression pressure. Effect size on symptoms including pain intensity, light touch threshold, static and moving two-point discrimination, target muscle force, and nerve conduction velocity will be quantified 3, 6, and 12 months postoperatively, and compared (1) to the preoperative values and (2) to the contralateral lower extremity that continues non-operative management. Clinical significance: Targeted surgical release may alleviate mechanical strain on entrapped lower extremity nerves and thereby potentially improve pain and sensory dysfunction in a subset of patients suffering from diabetic neuropathy. This trial aims to shed light on these patients that potentially benefit from screening for lower extremity nerve entrapment, as typical symptoms of entrapment might be erroneously attributed to neuropathy only, thereby preventing adequate treatment.

N2  - Although epicardial bipolar radiofrequency ablation should diminish the risk of esophageal thermal injury in comparison to an endocardial ablation, cases of lethal atrio-esophageal fistula have been reported. To better understand this risk and to reduce the possibility of a thermal injury, we monitored the esophageal temperature with the Circa S-Cath™ temperature probe during and immediately after the ablation while implementing three procedural safety measures. Twenty patients (15 males; 63 ± 10 years) were prospectively enrolled (November 2019–February 2021). All patients underwent an epicardial ablation procedure, including an antral left and right pulmonary vein isolation with bidirectional bipolar clamping, and a roof and inferior line using unidirectional bipolar radiofrequency. Three procedural preventive mitigations were implemented: (1) transesophageal echocardiographic visualization of the atrio-esophageal interface, with probe retraction before the energy delivery; (2) lifting the ablated tissue away from the esophagus during an energy application; and (3) a 30 s cool-off and irrigation period after the energy delivery. The esophageal temperature was recorded using an insulated multisensory intraluminal esophageal temperature probe (Circa S-Cath™). Of the 20 patients enrolled, 7 patients had paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AF), 8 persistent AF and 5 longstanding persistent AF. The average maximum luminal esophageal temperature observed was 36.2 ± 0.7 °C (34.8–38.2 °C). In our clinical experience, no abrupt increase in the luminal esophageal temperature above the baseline was observed. Since no measurements exceeded the threshold of 39 °C, no prompt interruption of energy delivery was required. Intraluminal esophageal temperature monitoring is feasible and can be helpful in confirming correct catheter position and safe energy application in bipolar epicardial left atrial ablation. Intra-procedural preventive mitigations should be implemented to reduce the risk of esophageal temperature rises.

N2  - Ex situ heart perfusion (ESHP) was developed to preserve and evaluate donated hearts in a perfused beating state. However, myocardial function declines during ESHP, which limits the duration of perfusion and the potential to expand the donor pool. In this research, we combine a novel, minimally-invasive sampling approach with comparative global metabolite profiling to evaluate changes in the metabolomic patterns associated with declines in myocardial function during ESHP. Biocompatible solid-phase microextraction (SPME) microprobes serving as chemical biopsy were used to sample heart tissue and perfusate in a translational porcine ESHP model and a small cohort of clinical cases. In addition, six core-needle biopsies of the left ventricular wall were collected to compare the performance of our SPME sampling method against that of traditional tissue-collection. Our state-of-the-art metabolomics platform allowed us to identify a large number of significantly altered metabolites and lipid species that presented comparable profile of alterations to conventional biopsies. However, significant discrepancies in the pool of identified analytes using two sampling methods (SPME vs. biopsy) were also identified concerning mainly compounds susceptible to dynamic biotransformation and most likely being a result of low-invasive nature of SPME. Overall, our results revealed striking metabolic alterations during prolonged 8h-ESHP associated with uncontrolled inflammation not counterbalanced by resolution, endothelial injury, accelerated mitochondrial oxidative stress, the disruption of mitochondrial bioenergetics, and the accumulation of harmful lipid species. In conclusion, the combination of perfusion parameters and metabolomics can uncover various mechanisms of organ injury and recovery, which can help differentiate between donor hearts that are transplantable from those that should be discarded.

N2  - Background: Esophageal temperature monitors are often used to decrease risk of esophageal injury during atrial fibrillation ablation. Multi-sensor monitors have been shown to have a superior thermodynamic profile in radiofrequency ablation, but there is limited data on single versus multi-electrode temperature discrepancies in cryoballoon ablation. Objective: We aim to evaluate temperature differences in the Circa S-Cath, a multi-sensor esophageal probe, to investigate its potential benefits over a single sensor probe in cryoablation. Methods: A total of 15 patients underwent cryoballoon ablation for atrial fibrillation under general anesthesia. A Circa probe was placed oropharyngeally after intubation. The Circa Esophageal Temperature Monitor has 12 sensors total located 8mm apart. Each sensor has a radiopaque marker and collects a temperature to the nearest 10th of a degree every half second. Position of the Crica probe could be adjusted under fluoroscopy. Results: In the total of 15 patients, a minimum esophageal temperature below 25 °C was recorded in 8 cases during cryoablation. The lowest esophageal temperature did not occur in the same sensor for all cases or even freezes in the same patient. Sensor 7 recorded the coldest temperature in 7/15 of these freezes, Sensor 8 recorded 3/15, Sensor 10 recorded 2/15, and Sensors 4, 5, and 10 recorded one each. When compared to neighboring sensors, the largest difference between neighboring sensors was 13.14 degrees, with a range of 5.6 to 19.9 degrees. Conclusion: The disparity between neighboring temperature sensors suggest that single sensor probes are insufficient to detect the lowest temperature of the esophagus. Continuation of cryoablation to very low temperatures could increase risk of collateral injury to the esophagus. Use of multi-sensor temperature probes helps in accurately reflecting the coldest temperature point of the esophagus during cryoablation. Similar discrepancy may also be seen in radiofrequency ablation.

N2  - Background: High-power short-duration (HP-SD) radiofrequency ablation (RFA) has been proposed as a method for producing rapid and effective lesions for pulmonary vein isolation. The underlying hypothesis assumes an increased resistive heating phase and decreased conductive heating phase, potentially reducing the risk for esophageal thermal injury. The objective of this study was to compare the esophageal temperature dynamic profile between HP-SD and moderate-power moderate-duration (MP-MD) RFA ablation strategies. Methods: In patients undergoing pulmonary vein isolation, RFA juxtaposed to the esophagus was delivered in an alternate sequence of HP-SD (50 W, 8-10 s) and MP-MD (25 W, 15-20 s) between adjacent applications (distance, ≤4 mm). Esophageal temperature was recorded using a multisensor probe (CIRCA S-CATH). Temperature data included magnitude of temperature rise, maximal temperature, time to maximal temperature, and time return to baseline. In swine, a similar experimental design compared the effect of HP-SD and MP-MD on patterns of esophageal injury. Results: In 20 patients (68.9±5.8 years old; 60% persistent atrial fibrillation), 55 paired HP-SD and MP-MD applications were analyzed. The esophageal temperature dynamic profile was similar between HP-SD and MP-MD ablation strategies. Specifically, the magnitude of temperature rise (2.1 °C [1.4-3] versus 2.0 °C [1.5-3]; P=0.22), maximal temperature (38.4 °C [37.8-39.3] versus 38.5 °C [37.9-39.4]; P=0.17), time to maximal temperature (24.9±7.5 versus 26.3±6.8 s; P=0.1), and time of temperature to return to baseline (110±23.2 versus 111±25.1 s; P=0.86) were similar between HP-SD and MP-MD ablation strategies. In 6 swine, esophageal injury was qualitatively similar between HP-SD and MP-MD strategies. Conclusions: Esophageal temperature dynamics are similar between HP-SD and MP-MD RFA strategies and result in comparable esophageal tissue injury. Therefore, when using a HP-SD RFA strategy, the shorter application duration should not prompt shorter intervals between applications.
