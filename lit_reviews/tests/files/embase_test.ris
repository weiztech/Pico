N2  - Objective: To investigate the incidence of hemolysis and its association with outcome in neonates with congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) requiring venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) treatment using a Medos Deltastream circuit with a DP3 pump, a hilite 800 LT oxygenator system, and a ¼' tubing. Study design: Plasma free hemoglobin (PFH) was prospectively measured once daily during ECMO using spectrophotometric testing. Patients (n = 62) were allocated into two groups according to presence or absence of hemolysis. Hemolysis was defined as PFH ≥ 50 mg/dL on at least 2 consecutive days during ECMO treatment. Hemolysis was classified as either moderate with a maximum PFH of 50-100 mg/dL or severe with a maximum PFH >100 mg/dL. Results: Hemolysis was detected in 14 patients (22.6%). Mortality was 100% in neonates with hemolysis compared with 31.1% in neonates without hemolysis (P < .001). In 21.4% hemolysis was moderate and in 78.6% severe. Using multivariable analysis, hemolysis (hazard ratio: 6.8; 95%CI: 1.86-24.86) and suprasystemic pulmonary hypertension (PH) (hazard ratio: 3.07; 95%CI: 1.01-9.32) were independently associated with mortality. Hemolysis occurred significantly more often using 8 French (Fr) cannulae than 13 Fr cannulae (43% vs 17%; P = .039). Cutoff for relative ECMO flow to predict hemolysis were 115 ml/kg/ minute for patients with 8 Fr cannulae (Area under the curve [AUC] 0.786, P = .042) and 100 ml/kg/ minute for patients with 13 Fr cannulae (AUC 0.840, P < .001). Conclusions: Hemolysis in CDH neonates receiving venovenous ECMO is independently associated with mortality.

N2  - Carboxyhemoglobin (COHb) is potentially a novel marker of hemolysis on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) and may be useful as an indicator for circuit-related complication in adults, but little is known about COHb levels in children. An observational single-center study was performed between January 2018 and December 2021. Fifty-eight children were included and COHb levels were obtained along with routine blood gas analysis before, during, and after ECMO support. From the 6th hour of ECMO support, the COHb level increased relative to the pre-ECMO level, with an adjusted mean difference of 0.44 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.26-0.62; p < 0.001) and remained higher during ECMO run and within 6 hours after weaning (p < 0.001). Among the 18 children (31%) who experienced at least one circuit-related complication leading to a circuit change, we observed a significant decrease in COHb levels within 24 hours after the circuit change, compared with the 24 hours before (adjusted mean difference, 0.54%; 95% CI, 0.27-0.80; p < 0.001). The maximal daily COHb level was able to predict circuit-related complications within 24 hours following COHb measurement with an area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of 0.85 (95% CI, 0.77-0.92; p < 0.001).

N2  - Objective: Pulsatile-flow veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (V-A ECMO) has shown encouraging results for microcirculation resuscitation and left ventricle unloading in patients with refractory cardiogenic shock. We aimed to comprehensively assess different V-A ECMO parameters and their contribution to hemodynamic energy production and transfer through the device circuit. Methods: We used the i-cor® ECMO circuit, which composed of Deltastream DP3 diagonal pump and i-cor® console (Xenios AG), the Hilite 7000 membrane oxygenator (Xenios AG), venous and arterial tubing and a 1 L soft venous pseudo-patient reservoir. Four different arterial cannulae (Biomedicus 15 and 17 Fr, Maquet 15 and 17 Fr) were used. For each cannula, 192 different pulsatile modes were investigated by adjusting flow rate, systole/diastole ratio, pulsatile amplitudes and frequency, yielding 784 unique conditions. A dSpace data acquisition system was used to collect flow and pressure data. Results: Increasing flow rates and pulsatile amplitudes were associated with significantly higher hemodynamic energy production (both p < 0.001), while no significant associations were seen while adjusting systole-to-diastole ratio (p = 0.73) or pulsing frequency (p = 0.99). Arterial cannula represents the highest resistance to hemodynamic energy transfer with 32%–59% of total hemodynamic energy generated being lost within, depending on pulsatile flow settings used. Conclusions: Herein, we presented the first study to compare hemodynamic energy production with all pulsatile ECLS pump settings and their combinations and widely used yet previously unexamined four different arterial ECMO cannula. Only increased flow rate and amplitude increase hemodynamic energy production as single factors, whilst other factors are relevant when combined.

N2  - Objectives: Hemolysis is a major complication in the application of extracorporeal blood pumps (ECBPs). In recent years, many studies were conducted on the hemolytic performance of ECBPs, but these focused only on specific operating points and neglected the entirety of the clinical operating point (COP) range. The aim of this study was to investigate blood damage potential of commonly used ECBPs under common (COPs). Methods: We used CFD models of the Xenios DP3 and Getinge Rotaflow ECBPs to predict hemolysis over a wide range of operating points by training reduced order models (ROMs) via non-intrusive polynomial chaos expansion allowing the rapid calculation of hydraulic and hemolytic parameters over the entire range of COPs. Additionally, we analyzed clinical data of 790 patients admitted to Intensive Care Unit from 2012 to 2021 undergoing extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) therapy. We extracted 97052 data points of pressure and flow and calculated the likelihood of each pump operating point occurring within the cohort range. By combining the reduced order models with the clinical likelihood of each operating point the clinically relevant blood damage potential of each pump was investigated. Results: Our model shows continuous characteristics of hemolysis performance over the entire operating point range of an ECBP. We identified the operating point of 3.94 l/min and 201 mmHg as the most common one within our cohort data range. Additionally, we compared the ECBPs within the 99 percentile of cohort operating points and showed that overall the Rotaflow had a lower blood damage potential then the DP3. Conclusions: We present a novel approach to combine clinical patient cohort data with numerical simulations in order to deduce hemolytic performance in ECBPs. Our results outline differences across ECBPs, which could help to find the most critical operating points in terms of blood damage in the development and approval process of ECBPs.

N2  - Objective: To investigate whether the pattern of flow through the ductus arteriosus (DA) is associated with the need for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support (ECMO) or death in neonates with congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH). Design: Retrospective observational study. Setting: German level III Neonatal Intensive Care Unit. Participants: 139 CDH neonates were born between March 2009 and May 2021. Methods: DA flow pattern was assessed in echocardiograms obtained within 24 h of life by measuring flow time and velocity time integral (VTI) for both left-to-right (LR) and right-to-left (RL) components of the ductal shunt. A VTI ratio (VTILR/VTIRL) < 1.0 and an RL relative flow time (Flow timeRL/(Flow timeLR+Flow timeRL)) >33% were defined as markers of abnormal flow patterns. The primary outcome was the need for ECMO. The secondary outcome was death. Results: 72 patients (51.8%) had a VTI ratio <1.0, 73 (52.5%) an RL relative flow time >33%. 59 patients (42.4%) had an alteration of both values. Need for ECMO was present in 37.4% (n = 52), while 19.4% (n = 27) died. A VTI ratio <1.0 had the highest diagnostic accuracy for the need for ECMO, (sensitivity 82.7%, specificity 66.7%, negative predictive value [NPV] 86.6%, and positive predictive value [PPV] 59.7%) as well as for death (sensitivity 77.8%, specificity 54.5%, NPV 91.0%, and PPV 29.2%). Patients with VTI ratio <1.0 were 4.7 times more likely to need ECMO and 3.3 times more likely to die. VTI ratio values correlated significantly with pulmonary hypertension (PH) severity (r = -0.516, p < 0.001). Conclusions: A VTI ratio <1.0 is a valuable threshold to identify high-risk CDH neonates. For improved risk stratification, other parameters—for example, left ventricular cardiac dysfunction—should be combined with DA flow assessment.

N2  - Introduction: Microfluidic oxygenators (MFO) are under development as an alternative to hollow-fiber membrane oxygenators (HFMO) for extracorporeal lung support to potentially mitigate hemocompatibility disturbances caused by non-physiologic blood flow in HFMO. MFOs utilize branching blood channel networks mimicking physiological microcirculation and potentially avoiding thrombosis and cellular damage. An MFO (BLOx, Draper; Cambridge, MA) was designed and constructed to enable clinical blood flow rates for extracorporeal CO2 removal (ECCO2R) (750 mL/min). Objective: Evaluate safety and feasibility of BLOx versus standard ECCO2R in vivo for 24-hrs. Hypothesis: BLOx does not alter vitals, ventilator requirements or elicit untoward effects relative to controls. Methods: Anesthetized mechanically ventilated swine were cannulated (18Fr dual-lumen) for VV-ECCO2R (750mL/min blood flow, 3L/min sweep) and assigned to: 1) CTRL (n=3; 56±5kg): standard oxygenator (MINILUNG; Xenios/Fresenius, Germany); or 2) BLOx (n=3; 55±5kg): MFO (BLOx; Draper, MA) using Novalung® console and DP3 pump (Xenios/Fresenius) with tubing connections. Vital signs and circuit settings were assessed hourly. Heparin was administered (CTRL ACT=125-160 sec; BLOx ACT=200-300 sec) with greater degree of anticoagulation utilized for BLOx circuits which were not heparin-coated. Blood was collected at baseline (BL), post-ECLS (PE) and through 24-hr to assess gas transfer, coagulation, and platelet aggregation/activation. Incidence of bleeding and thrombotic complications were recorded, and histology performed. Statistical comparisons were two-sided (p<0.05 for significance). Results: Ventilator/ECLS settings and clotting times are shown in Table 1. Transmembrane oxygen transfer and CO2 removal were greater in CTRL vs BLOx at all time points; although PaCO2 was not different between groups due to elevated ventilator settings in BLOx. ACT was elevated in BLOx versus CTRL due to increased anticoagulation. Platelet count (Fig1A) was reduced in BLOx versus baseline at 6-h (p=0.029), accompanied by a reduction in collagen- (p<0.01) and ADP-stimulated (n.s.) platelet aggregation at 6-24-hrs within BLOx compared to baseline (Fig1B). A significant increase in phosphatidyl serine expressing procoagulant platelet percentage in BLOx versus CTRL was observed at 6-h (p=0.039) (Fig1C). No group differences in PT, fibrinogen, D-dimer, ATIII, thromboelastography, free hemoglobin, vWF antigen, bleeding/thrombotic complications, or histology were observed. Conclusions: In this longest to date in vivo pilot study, a MFO did not elicit significant untoward systemic effects relative to control; however, comparable gas-transfer and hemocompatibility performance to control will require further MFO scaling. Additional clinically-relevant studies are necessary and ongoing in our laboratory. Investigation of a hemocompatible surface coating for BLOx is also underway.

N2  - The physical fitness of patients with terminal heart failure and an implanted left ventricular assist device (LVAD) might be improved by load-adaptive control of the LVAD. In this study, three control strategies for LVAD were compared in eight pigs: (1) a constant stroke work (CSW) control strategy that ensures a constant ventricular load using ventricular stroke work as the control variable; (2) a work ratio (WR) controller that maintains a constant ratio of ventricular work to hydraulic pump work; and (3) a controller that maintains the pump pace at a constant speed (CS). Biventricular heart insufficiency was induced by increased isoflurane application, and preload, afterload, and contractility alterations were performed. LVAD speed changes were significantly more pronounced in all load interventions with the CSW control strategy (preload: P < 0.001 vs. CS and P = 0.004 vs. WR; afterload: P < 0.001 vs. CS and P < 0.001 vs. WR; contractility: P < 0.001 vs. CS and P < 0.001 vs. WR). However, a significant difference in systemic flow only became evident in the experiments upon afterload increase (P < 0.001 vs. CS and P = 0.004 vs. WR). An implementation of an evolved version of the CSW control strategy that dispenses with invasively measured parameters might be feasible for clinical use.

N2  - Purpose: Blood damage has been associated with patients under temporary continuous-flow mechanical circulatory support. To evaluate the side effects caused by transit blood pumping, in vitro hemocompatibility testing for blood damage in pumps is considered a necessary reference before clinical trials. Methods: The hemocompatibility of five extracorporeal centrifugal blood pumps was investigated comprehensively, including four commercial pumps (the Abbott CentriMag, the Terumo Capiox, the Medos DP3, and the Medtronic BPX-80) and a pump in development (the magAssist MoyoAssist®). In vitro, hemolysis was tested with heparinized porcine blood at nominal operating conditions (5 L/min, 160 mmHg) and extreme operating conditions (1 L/min, 290 mmHg) using a circulation flow loop. Hematology analyses concerning the blood cell counts and the degradation of high-molecular-weight von Willebrand factor (VWF) during 6-h circulation were also evaluated. Results: Comparing the in vitro hemocompatibility of blood pumps at different operations, the blood damage was significantly more severe at extreme operating conditions than that at nominal operating conditions. The performance of the five blood pumps was arranged in different orders at these two operating conditions. The results also demonstrated superior hemocompatibility of CentriMag and MoyoAssist® at two operating conditions, with overall low blood damage at hemolysis level, blood cell counts, and degradation of high-molecular-weight VWF. It suggested that magnetic bearings have an advantage in hemocompatibility compared to the mechanical bearing of blood pumps. Conclusion: Involving multiple operating conditions of blood pumps in in vitro hemocompatibility evaluation will be helpful for clinical application. In addition, the magnetically levitated centrifugal blood pump MoyoAssist® shows great potential in the future as it demonstrated good in vitro hemocompatibility.

N2  - Ischaemia–reperfusion injury (IRI) is an inevitable process in transplantation and results in inflammation and immune system activation. Alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) has anti-inflammatory properties. Normothermic machine perfusion (NMP) can be used to deliver therapies and may help in assessing the effects of IRI and immunity. This study investigated the effects of AAT on IRI and inflammation in pig kidneys when administered during preservation, followed by normothermic reperfusion (NR) with autologous whole blood, as a surrogate for transplant. Two different models were used to deliver AAT or placebo to paired slaughterhouse pig kidneys: Model 1: 7-h static cold storage (SCS) + 3-h NR (n = 5 pairs), where either AAT (10 mg/ml) or placebo was delivered in the flush following retrieval; Model 2: 4-h SCS + 3-h NMP + 3-h NR (n = 5 pairs), where either AAT or placebo was delivered during NMP. Injury markers and cytokines levels were analysed in the perfusate, and heat shock protein 70 KDa (HSP-70) was analysed in biopsies. AAT delivered to kidneys showed no adverse effects on perfusion parameters. HSP-70 fold changes were significantly lower in the AAT group during NMP (P < 0.01, paired t-test) but not during NR. Interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra) fold changes were significantly higher in the AAT group during NR model 1 (p < 0.05, two-way ANOVA). In contrast to the AAT group, significant upregulation of interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) between t = 90 min and t = 180 min and interleukin-8 (IL-8) between baseline and t = 90 min was observed in the control group in NR model 2 (p < 0.05, Tukey’s multiple comparison test). However, overall inflammatory cytokines and injury markers showed similar levels between groups. Delivery of AAT to pig kidneys was safe without any detrimental effects. NMP and NR provided excellent methods for comparison of inflammation and immune activation in the delivery of a novel therapy.

N2  - Objectives: Hemolysis, defined as a plasma free hemoglobin (PFH) >50 mg/dl, has been associated with mortality and poor outcome in neonates receiving extracorporeal life support (ECLS). Among neonates receiving ECLS for respiratory failure, those with congenital diaphragmatic hernia have a high mortality of approximately 50%. Aim of this study was to investigate the kinetics of PFH and its association with outcome in CDH neonates during venovenous ECLS. Methods: Sixty-two patients were prospectively enrolled. Venovenous ECLS was performed using a Medos DP3 pump with a Hilite 800LT oxygenator (Xenios AG). PFH was determined daily during ECLS using spectrophotometric testing. Hemolysis was defined as a PFH >50mg/dl. Group allocation according to occurrence of hemolysis. Results: Hemolysis occurred in 50% during ECLS and in 33.9% within the first 7 days. Characteristics of patients with and without hemolysis are demonstrated in table 1. Mortality for neonates with hemolysis was 64.5% compared to 29% (p = .005). The ECLS duration was < 7d in 41.9%, 7-14 days in 25.8%, and > 14d 32.3%, with a mortality of 23.1%, 37.5%, and 85%, respectively. 19.2%, 50% and 90% of patients developed hemolysis within one, two, and > 2 weeks of ECLS, respectively. On univariate analysis hemolysis, ECLS duration >10 days, and prematurity <35weeks were significantly associated withmortality. On multivariate analysis, only hemolysis remained significantly associated with death (HR: 2.72; 95%CI: 1.04-7.09, p = 0.041), but neither prematurity <35 weeks (HR: 1.32; 95%CI: 0.56-3.13, p = 0.523) nor ECLS duration >10 days (HR: 1.86; 95%CI: 0.80- 4.31, p = 0.150). Conclusions: In our cohort, we observed a high rate of hemolysis during venovenous ECLS in CDH neonates which remained independently associated with mortality after correcting for confounders. For routine use it must be considered that preanalytical handling impacts PFH testing. (Table Presented).

N2  - Purpose: With newer generation diagonal and centrifugal blood pumps gaining popularity, the objective of this study was to compare the DP3-i-cor diagonal and RotaFlow centrifugal pumps in terms of hemodynamic performance using simulated neonatal and pediatric extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) circuits. Description: The DP3-i-cor diagonal pump is a part of the newly FDA-approved NovaLung system. The experimental circuit consisted of either the DP3-i-cor diagonal or RotaFlow centrifugal pump, a polymethylpentene membrane oxygenator, neonatal and pediatric arterial/venous cannulae, and 1/4-inch ID tubing. Three circuits were tested using combinations of either the DP3-i-cor or RotaFlow pump and varying arterial/venous cannulae sizes. Real-time pressure and flow data were collected. Evaluation: The new DP3-i-cor diagonal pump exhibited lower flow rate and pressure head when compared to the RotaFlow centrifugal pump at similar rotational speeds and identical experimental conditions. Large-caliber arterial cannulae expectedly generated higher flow rates and pressures. Conclusions: The RotaFlow centrifugal pump demonstrated superior hemodynamic performance when compared to the DP3-i-cor diagonal pump in simulated neonatal and pediatric ECMO circuits. Translational research of all ECMO components is crucial.

N2  - Three-dimensionally (3D) printed models have been increasingly used in medicine. Few reports have focused on prototype experiments, especially in aortic surgery. Although endovascular repairs are routinely performed for thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms and lesions involving the aortic arch, endovascular treatment of the ascending aorta is still at an early stage of development. Using a 3D model, based on patient computed tomography scans and manufactured by Biomodex (Paris, France), we performed a patient-specific rehearsal of an endovascular Bentall repair to treat an ascending aorta aneurysm involving the aortic root. We achieved a patient-specific proof of concept of a new technique using an in vitro 3D model.

N2  - Extracorporeal life support (ECLS) has grown in its application since its first clinical description in the 1970s. The technology has been used to support a wide variety of mechanical support modalities and diseases, including respiratory failure, cardiorespiratory failure, and cardiac failure. Over many decades and safety and efficacy studies, followed by randomized clinical trials and thousands of clinical uses, ECLS is considered as an accepted treatment option for severe pulmonary and selected cardiovascular failure. Extracorporeal life support involves the use of support artificial organs, including a membrane lung and blood pump. Over time, changes in the technology and the management of ECLS support devices have evolved. This manuscript describes the use of membrane lungs and blood pumps used during ECLS support from 2002 to 2017 in over 65,000 patients reported to the Extracorporeal Life Support Organization Registry. Device longevity and complications associated with membrane lungs and blood pump are described and stratified by age group: neonates, pediatrics, and adults.

N2  - Pediatric heart failure (HF) patients have been a historically underserved population for mechanical circulatory support (MCS) therapy. To address this clinical need, we are developing a low cost, universal magnetically levitated extracorporeal system with interchangeable pump heads for pediatric support. Two impeller and pump designs (pump V1 and V2) for the pediatric pump were developed using dimensional analysis techniques and classic pump theory based on defined performance criteria (generated flow, pressure, and impeller diameter). The designs were virtually constructed using computer-aided design (CAD) software and 3D flow and pressure features were analyzed using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis. Simulated pump designs (V1, V2) were operated at higher rotational speeds (∼5,000 revolutions per minute [RPM]) than initially estimated (4,255 RPM) to achieve the desired operational point (3.5 L/min flow at 150 mm Hg). Pump V2 outperformed V1 by generating approximately 30% higher pressures at all simulated rotational speeds and at 5% lower priming volume. Simulated hydrodynamic performance (achieved flow and pressure, hydraulic efficiency) of our pediatric pump design, featuring reduced impeller size and priming volume, compares favorably to current commercially available MCS devices.

N2  - The implantation of a left ventricular assist device (LVAD) is often the only therapy in terminal heart failure (HF). However, despite technical advancements, the physical fitness of the patients is still limited. One strategy to improve the benefits of ventricular assist device therapy might be the implementation of load adaptive control strategies. Two control strategies and a constant speed controller (CS) were implemented in an acute animal model where four healthy pigs received LVAD implantations. In the first strategy (preload recruitable stroke work [SW] controller, PRS), the desired pump work was computed in relation to the end-diastolic volume. In the second strategy, the controller was programmed to keep a fixed ratio of the mean hydraulic power of the assist device to the mean hydraulic power of the left ventricle (power relation controller, PR). Preload reduction, afterload increase experiments and short-term coronary artery occlusions were conducted to test the behavior of the control strategies under variable conditions. Within the experiments, the PR controller demonstrated the best preload sensitivity. The PRS controller had the best response to an increased afterload and to a reduced ventricular contractility in terms of effectively preventing ventricular overloading and increasing VAD support. No significant differences in systemic flow were observed.

N2  - Objective: The objective of this translational study was to compare the RotaFlow centrifugal blood pump (Maquet Inc, USA) vs. a DP3-i-cor diagonal pump (Xenios AG, Germany) in terms of hemodynamic performance using simulated neonatal and pediatric extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) circuits with different sizes of arterial and venous cannulae. Methods: The experimental circuit was composed of the Rotaflow centrifugal pump or a DP3 diagonal pump heads, a polymethylpentene membrane oxygenator, neonatal and pediatric arterial/venous cannulae, and 1/4-inch ID tubing. Circuits were primed with lactated Ringer's solution and packed human red blood cells (hematocrit 35%). Trials were conducted at 36°C using the two pump heads and different cannulae (arterial/venous cannulae: 8 Fr/18 Fr, 10 Fr/20 Fr, and 12 Fr/22 Fr) at various flow rates and rotational- speeds. Results: The RotaFlow pump had a higher pressure head and flow range compared with the DP3 diagonal pump at the same rotational speed and identical experimental settings (P < 0.001). The DP3 diagonal pump had more than 100% higher rpm compared to a Rotaflow centrifugal pump at identical experimental conditions (Figure 1). Pressure-flow curves using 8Fr, 10Fr and 12 Fr arterial cannulae had identical patterns. Conclusions: The RotaFlow centrifugal pump had a significantly better hemodynamic performance when compared to the DP3 i-cor diagonal blood pump at identical experimental conditions in simulated neonatal and pediatric ECMO settings. To verify our in vitro findings, hemolysis evaluations of each pump in neonatal and pediatric settings should be completed.

N2  - The combination of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) and extracorporeal blood purification in children is rarely used due to small total blood volumes, risks of hemodynamic instability and a negative association between volume of blood transfusion and patient outcome. To our knowledge, this is the first description of a multimodal extracorporeal detoxication in the setting of ECMO in a post-kidney-transplant child on immunosuppression. We describe a case of a 30-months old child, who was extracorporeally resuscitated after cardiac arrest during kidney transplantation surgery and additionally treated with a number of extracorporeal blood purification methods (plasma exchange, CytoSorb, and lipopolysaccharide adsorption) in the setting of immunosuppression therapy. This case report shows the successful use of multimodal extracorporeal therapies for a good patient outcome. The lack of response to CytoSorb therapy might suggest an occult infection and not necessarily failure of treatment.

N2  - Since the use of continuous flow blood pumps as ventricular assist devices is standard, the problems with haemolysis have increased. It is mainly induced by shear stress affecting the erythrocyte membrane. There are many investigations about haemolysis in laminar and turbulent blood flow. The results defined as threshold levels for the damage of erythrocytes depend on the exposure time of the shear stress, but they are very different, depending on the used experimental methods or the calculation strategy. Here, the results are resumed and shown in curves. Different models for the calculation of the strengths of erythrocytes are discussed. There are few results reported about tests of haemolysis in blood pumps, but some theoretical approaches for the design of continuous flow blood pumps according to low haemolysis have been investigated within the last years.

N2  - Objective: To determine plasma free hemoglobin (pfHb) levels under non-pulsatile and pulsatile modes using the two pump systems in simulated adult ECLS circuits. Methods: Eight sterile ECLS circuits were divided into four groups: Medos DP3 under nonpulsatile mode at flow rate 4 L/min (DP3-NP-4L, n=2), Medos DP3 under pulsatile mode with pulsatile amplitude 1500rpm at 4 L/ min (DP3-P-4L, n=2), Medos DP3 under pulsatile mode with pulsatile amplitude 1500rpm at 3 L/min (DP3- P-3L, n=2), i-cor pump under pulsatile mode with pulsatile amplitude 3500rpm at 2.5 L/min (i-corP-2.5L, n=2). All trials were conducted for 12h at a blood temperature of 36°C for the Medos circuit and room temperature for the i-cor circuit as the i-cor system lacks an integrated heat exchanger for the iLA membrane ventilator using fresh human blood. Blood samples were collected after priming and after every 3h for 12h. Results: The pfHb levels in all groups increased at the end of 12h-ECLS (Figure 1). The Medos pulsatile group at 4 L/min had maximum pfHb value, and the nonpulsatile group had minimum pfHb value at 12h-ECLS. The i-cor pulsatile group at 2.5 L/min had a lower pfHb value compared to the Medos DP3 pulsatile group at 3 L/min (Figure 1). Conclusions: High flow rates with high rotational speeds, especially under pulsatile mode, cause more hemolysis. Further investigation of the perfusion modes in a chronic animal ECLS model is warranted. (Figure Presented).

N2  - Objective: The objective of this study is to compare hemodynamic performances under different pulsatile control algorithms between Medos DeltaStream DP3 and i-cor diagonal pumps in simulated pediatric and adult ECLS systems. Methods: The experimental circuit consisted of parallel combined pediatric and adult ECLS circuits using an i-cor pump head and either an i-cor console or Medos console, a Medos Hilite 2400 LT oxygenator for the pediatric ECLS circuit, and a Medos Hilite 7000 LT oxygenator for the adult ECLS circuit. The circuit was primed with lactated Ringer's solution and human packed red blood cells (hematocrit 40%). Trials were conducted at various flow rates (pediatric circuit: 0.5 and 1 L/min; adult circuit: 2 and 4 L/min) under nonpulsatile and pulsatile modes (pulsatile amplitude: 1000- 5000rpm [1000 rpm increments] for i-cor pump, 500-2500rpm [500 rpm increments] for Medos-DP3 pump) at 36°C. Results: Under pulsatile mode, energy equivalent pressures were always greater than mean pressures for the two systems. Total hemodynamic energy and surplus-hemodynamic- energy (SHE) levels delivered to the patient increased with increasing pulsatile amplitude and decreased with increasing flow rate. The i-cor pump outperformed at low flow rates, but the Medos pump performed superiorly at high flow rates. There was no significant difference between two pumps in percentage of energy loss. Conclusions: Different pulsatile control algorithms of Medos and i-cor-consoles had great effects on the qualiity of pulsatility. Although high pulsatile amplitudes delivered higher levels of hemodynamic energy to the patient, the high rotational speeds increased the risk of hemolysis. Further optimized pulsatile control algorithms are needed. (Figure Presented).

N2  - Background/Purpose: Rotary blood pumps are frequently used in extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) or extracorporeal carbon dioxide removal (ECCO2R) in the low flow range, although they have not been specifically developed and tested for the required operating points. When using pumps outside their specification, for example, in the case of ECMO in pediatric therapy or ECCO2R, prolonged recirculation occurs in the volute of the rotary pump due to the low flow at comparably high-pressure heads. Therefore, we show the deviating and significantly higher hemolysis values of a pump run below its optimal operating range. Methods: In this study, we evaluate the index of hemolysis of the Xenios DP3 by means of computational flow dynamics analysis (CFD) simulations and validate the simulation results by in vitro tests. The tests (n = 6) were performed according to ASTM F1841-97 (2017) with porcine blood. A typical operating point for the mentioned applications was chosen at 1 L/min against a pressure head of 250 mm Hg by adjusting the pump speed. Hemolysis was assessed photometrically, additionally the platelet count was recorded. Results: The study substantiates the results of the CFD simulation that hemolysis at 1 L/min is almost 3.7 times higher than at 4 L/min using the DP3 as an example of a rotary pump operating below its optimal operating range. In addition, the decrease in platelets could be observed in the in vitro tests within 6 hours. Conclusions: ECCO2R or ECMO applications require pumps specifically designed to operate at low flow rates against comparatively high-pressure heads. Pumps currently used in the low flow range cause severe blood damage, which can lead to serious problems during treatment. The advantages of the above-mentioned therapies can only be fully achieved if dedicated pumps for low flow applications are developed.

N2  - The objective of this translational study was to compare the RotaFlow centrifugal blood pump (Maquet Inc, USA) versus a DP3-i-cor diagonal pump (Xenios AG, Germany) in terms of hemodynamic performance using simulated neonatal and pediatric extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) circuits with different sizes of arterial and venous cannulae. The experimental circuit was composed of the Rotaflow centrifugal pump or a DP3 diagonal pump heads, a polymethylpentene membrane oxygenator, neonatal and pediatric arterial/ venous cannulae, and 1/4-inch ID tubing. Circuits were primed with lactated Ringer's solution and packed human red blood cells (hematocrit 35%) (Figure 1). Trials were conducted at 36°C using the two pump heads and different cannulae (arterial/venous cannulae: 8 Fr/18 Fr, 10 Fr/20 Fr, and 12 Fr/22 Fr) at various flow rates and rotational speeds. The RotaFlow pump had a higher pressure head and flow range compared with the DP3 diagonal pump at the same rotational speed and identical experimental settings (P < .001). The DP3 diagonal pump had more than 100% higher rpm compared to a Rotaflow centrifugal pump at identical experimental conditions (Figure 2). Small-caliber arterial cannulae and higher flow-rates predictably created higher circuitpressures and pressure-drops. The RotaFlow centrifugal pump had a significantly better hemodynamic performance when compared to the DP3 i-cor diagonal blood pump at identical experimental conditions in simulated neonatal and pediatric ECMO settings.

N2  - Diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH) is a rare but life-threatening disease. Mortality is very high in those patients who require mechanical ventilation. Traditionally, active bleeding has been considered a contraindication for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) support. There is limited evidence for ECMO in DAH as rescue therapy. Herein, we describe a case of anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies-associated DAH with intractable hypoxemic respiratory failure. An appropriate ventilator strategy failed to improve her hypoxemia leading to imminent risk to her life. The patient was rescued with veno-venous ECMO targeting lower than usual range of anticoagulation. ECMO proved to be lifesaving in our patient who was initiated on prompt immunosuppressive therapy and plasmapheresis along with continuous veno-venous hemodiafiltration and hemodynamic support. We feel that ECMO could be considered as adjunctive therapy in severe hypoxemic respiratory failure associated with DAH after careful consideration of the risk of bleeding and a restrictive anticoagulation strategy.

N2  - Introduction: Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is used increasingly in critically ill patients suffering from acute respiratory failure, cardiogenic shock or cardiac arrest. However, this therapy can have deleterious side effects such as bleeding or clotting complications and hemolysis. These complications are particularly caused by physical stress acting upon the blood components while passing through the ECMO system, especially within the rotary pump. We here present a novel approach to simulate blood flows through rotary blood pumps used in current ECMO systems in order to better understand the genesis of these complications. Methods: Geometries of the Xenios DP3 (Xenios AG, Heilbronn, Germany) rotary pump were reconstructed by CT-scans and manual measurements using computer-aided design (CAD). The Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulation was performed using the software Preon- Lab (FIFTY2 Technology GmbH, Freiburg, Germany), which implements a mesh-free Lagrangian method requiring minimal preprocessing of the CAD data. The geometries are introduced to the simulation model as tessellated surfaces. Five operating points have been specified by the rotation of the centrifugal fan and the corresponding inflow and outflow of blood. The blood is approximatively modelled as a Newtonian fluid with a density of 1040 kg/m3. Results: PreonLab allows detailed assessment of the blood flow while passing through the rotary pump including analysis of local flow rates, pressure gradients and shear stress acting upon the blood. Dead zones in the fluid flow can be detected which gives reference points for optimizations of the pump design. Conclusions: For the first time, we demonstrate a novel approach for flow simulation in an ECMO rotary pump (Figure 1). This approach may help better understand hemodynamics within the extracorporeal system to define optimal operating points or re-design components aiming to limit hemolysis, coagulation disorders and bleeding in seriously ill patients.

N2  - Background: Extracorporeal carbon dioxide removal (ECCO2R) uses an extracorporeal circuit to directly remove carbon dioxide from the blood either in lieu of mechanical ventilation or in combination with it. While the potential benefits of the technology are leading to increasing use, there are very real risks associated with it. Several studies demonstrated major bleeding and clotting complications, often associated with hemolysis and poorer outcomes in patients receiving ECCO2R. A better understanding of the risks originating specifically from the rotary blood pump component of the circuit is urgently needed. Methods: High-resolution computational fluid dynamics was used to calculate the hemodynamics and hemocompatibility of three current rotary blood pumps for various pump flow rates. Results: The hydraulic efficiency dramatically decreases to 5-10% if operating at blood flow rates below 1 L/min, the pump internal flow recirculation rate increases 6-12-fold in these flow ranges, and adverse effects are increased due to multiple exposures to high shear stress. The deleterious consequences include a steep increase in hemolysis and destruction of platelets. Conclusions: The role of blood pumps in contributing to adverse effects at the lower blood flow rates used during ECCO2R is shown here to be significant. Current rotary blood pumps should be used with caution if operated at blood flow rates below 2 L/min, because of significant and high recirculation, shear stress, and hemolysis. There is a clear and urgent need to design dedicated blood pumps which are optimized for blood flow rates in the range of 0.5-1.5 L/min.

N2  - The objective of this study is to compare hemodynamic performances under different pulsatile control algorithms between Medos DeltaStream DP3 and i-cor diagonal pumps in simulated pediatric and adult ECLS systems. The experimental circuit consisted of parallel combined pediatric and adult ECLS circuits using an i-cor-pump head and either an i-cor console or Medos console, a Medos Hilite 2400LT oxygenator for the pediatric ECLS circuit, and a Medos Hilite 7000LT oxygenator for the adult ECLS circuit. The circuit was primed with lactated Ringer's solution and human packed red blood cells (hematocrit 40%). Trials were conducted at various flow rates (pediatric circuit: 0.5 and 1 L/min; adult circuit: 2 and 4 L/min) under nonpulsatile and pulsatile modes (pulsatile amplitude: 1000-5000rpm [1000 rpm increments] for i-cor pump, 500-2500rpm [500 rpm increments] for Medos-DP3 pump) at 36°C. Under pulsatile mode, energy equivalent pressures were always greater than mean pressures for the two systems. Total hemodynamic energy and surplus hemodynamic energy levels delivered to the patient increased with increasing pulsatile amplitude and decreased with increasing flow rate. The i-cor pump outperformed at low flow rates, but the Medos pump performed superiorly at high flow rates. There was no significant difference between two pumps in percentage of energy loss. Pulsatile control algorithms of Medos and i-cor consoles had great effects on pulsatility. Although high pulsatile amplitudes delivered higher levels of hemodynamic energy to the patient, the high rotational speeds increased the risk of hemolysis. Further optimized pulsatile control algorithms are needed.

N2  - The objective of this pilot study was to determine plasma free hemoglobin (pfHb), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels under non-pulsatile and pulsatile modes using the two pump systems in simulated-adult-ECLS-circuits. Eight ECLS circuits were divided into four groups: Medos-DP3 under nonpulsatile mode at flow rate 4 L/min (DP3-NP-4L, n=2), Medos-DP3 under pulsatile mode with pulsatile amplitude 1500rpm at 4 L/ min (DP3- P-4L, n=2), Medos DP3 under pulsatile mode with pulsatile amplitude 1500rpm at 3 L/min (DP3-P-3L, n=2), i-cor pump under pulsatile mode with pulsatile amplitude 3500rpm at 2.5 L/min (i-corP-2.5L, n=2). All trials were conducted for 12h at a blood temperature of 36°C for the Medos circuit and room temperature for the i-cor circuit as the i-cor system lacks an integrated heat exchanger for the iLA membrane ventilator using fresh human blood. Blood samples were collected after priming and after every 3h for 12h. The pfHb levels in all groups increased at the end of 12h-ECLS. The Medos pulsatile group at 4 L/min had maximum pfHb value, and the nonpulsatile group had minimum pfHb value at 12h-ECLS. The i-cor pulsatile group at 2.5 L/min had a lower pfHb value compared to the Medos-DP3 pulsatile group at 3 L/min. LDH-levels had similar trends as pfHb levels in the Medos nonpulsatile and pulsatile groups. The 12h-LDH level in the i-cor pulsatile group was lower than the other three groups. High flow rates with high rotational speeds, especially under pulsatile mode, may lead to more hemolysis.

N2  - Objectives: Standardized hemolysis tests according to ASTM F1841-97 (2017) are the current gold standard for hemolysis evaluation. As part of the standard flow loop, a screw clamp is used to regulate the flow resistance in the circulations. Especially with extracorporeal pumps used for lung support, cardiopulmonary bypass application, or CO2-Removal, resistance has to maintain a pressure gradient of more than 500 mmHg. As a consequence, the screw clamp itself turns into a critical hemolysis hotspot, possibly overlying and biasing the hemolysis caused by the tested pump. Therefore, we present an alternative resistance causing only low hemolysis and at the same time maintaining ASTM testing specifications. Methods: We developed one novel resistance and evaluated the hemolysis potential of the novel and one alternative in flow loops. The flow loops were set up according to the ASTM standard with three identical pumps (Deltastream® DP3, Medos AG), two with the novel and alternative resistances each and one with the state-of-the art resistance, the screw clamp. The loops were set to high pressure conditions present in cardiopulmonary bypass applications, ECMO or CO2-Removal. The loops operated for 6 hours with porcine blood (n = 6). Blood samples were drawn hourly and free plasma hemoglobin was evaluated by means of photometric measurement. Results: A new resistance for ASTM pump evaluation at high pressure regimes with little impact on hemolysis was developed. The resistance is easy to integrate into the recirculation loop and can be adjusted continuously. In-vitro blood trials revealed lower hemolysis for the new resistance compared to the current gold standard. Discussion: Extracorporeal continuous flow blood pumps with transfemoral cannulation work against high pressure at low flow. Up to now, hemolysis evaluation of the pumps is biased by hemolysis caused by the flow loop resistance. Our newly designed resistance causes less hemolysis, thus allowing for more meaningful and reliable hemolysis test results.

N2  - Bleeding signs can become life-threatening complications in patients on mechanical circulatory support (MCS). Clinical phenotyping and comprehensive analyses of the cause of bleeding are, therefore, essential, especially when risk-stratifying patients during MCS workup. We conducted coagulation analyses and determined von Willebrand factor (VWF) parameters in a paediatric cohort on temporary extracorporeal life support, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation or long-term ventricular assist device support. METHODS: We carried out an observational single-centre study including 30 children with MCS (extracorporeal life support, n = 13; extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, n = 5; and ventricular assist device, n = 12). We also assessed the acquired von Willebrand parameters of each study participant: collagen binding capacity (VWF:CB), the ratio of collagen-binding capacity to VWF antigen (VWF:CB/VWF:Ag) and high-molecular-weight VWF multimers. We also documented bleeding events, transfusion requirement, haemolysis parameters and surgical interventions. All children developed AVWS (acquired von Willebrand syndrome) during MCS, usually during the early postoperative course. They presented no AVWS after device explantation. We detected a loss of high-molecular-weight VWF multimers, decreased VWF:CB/ VWF:Ag ratios and reduced VWF:CB levels. Twenty of the 30 patients experienced bleeding complications; approximately 53% of them required surgical revision. There were no deaths due to bleeding during support. The AVWS prevalence in paediatric patients on MCS is 100% regardless of the types of devices tested in this study. The bleeding propensity of AVWS patients widely varies.

N2  - The objective of this study is to compare hemodynamic performances under different pulsatile control algorithms between Medos DeltaStream DP3 and i-cor diagonal pumps in simulated pediatric and adult ECLS systems. An additional pilot study was designed to test hemolysis using two pumps during 12h-ECLS. The experimental circuit consisted of parallel combined pediatric and adult ECLS circuits using an i-cor pump head and either an i-cor console or Medos DeltaStream MDC console, a Medos Hilite 2400 LT oxygenator for the pediatric ECLS circuit, and a Medos Hilite 7000 LT oxygenator for the adult ECLS circuit. The circuit was primed with lactated Ringer's solution and human packed red blood cells (hematocrit 40%). Trials were conducted at various flow rates (pediatric circuit: 0.5 and 1L/min; adult circuit: 2 and 4L/min) under nonpulsatile and pulsatile modes (pulsatile amplitude: 1000–5000rpm [1000 rpm increments] for i-cor pump, 500–2500rpm [500 rpm increments] for Medos pump) at 36°C. In an additional protocol, fresh whole blood was used to test hemolysis under nonpulsatile and pulsatile modes using the two pump systems in adult ECLS circuits. Under pulsatile mode, energy equivalent pressures (EEP) were always greater than mean pressures for the two systems. Total hemodynamic energy (THE) and surplus hemodynamic energy (SHE) levels delivered to the patient increased with increasing pulsatile amplitude and decreased with increasing flow rate. The i-cor pump outperformed at low flow rates, but the Medos pump performed superiorly at high flow rates. There was no significant difference between two pumps in percentage of THE loss. The plasma free hemoglobin level was always higher in the Medos DP3 pulsatile group at 4 L/min compared to others. Pulsatile control algorithms of Medos and i-cor consoles had great effects on pulsatility. Although high pulsatile amplitudes delivered higher levels of hemodynamic energy to the patient, the high rotational speeds increased the risk of hemolysis. Use of proper pulsatile amplitude settings and intermittent pulsatile mode are suggested to achieve better pulsatility and decrease the risk of hemolysis. Further optimized pulsatile control algorithms are needed.

N2  - Extracorporeal life support (ECLS) weaning is a complex interdisciplinary process with no clear guidelines. To assess ventricular and pulmonary function as well as hemodynamics including end-organ recovery during ECLS weaning, we developed a standardized weaning protocol. We reviewed our experience 2 years later to assess its feasibility and efficacy. In 2015 we established an inter-professional, standardized, stepwise protocol for weaning from ECLS. If the patient did not require further surgery, weaning was conducted bedside in the intensive care unit (ICU). Most of the weaning procedures are guided via echocardiography. Data acquisition began at baseline level, followed by four-step course (each step lasting 10 min), entailing flow-reduction and ending 30 min after decannulation. Moreover, data from the preprotocol era are presented. Between May 2015 and 2017, 26 consecutive patients (18 male), median age 177 days (2 days–20 years) required ECLS with median support of 4 (2–11) days. Excluding eight not weanable patients, 21 standardized weaning procedures were protocolled in the remaining 18 children. Our generally successful protocol-guided weaning rate (with at least 24-h survival) was 89%, with a discharge home rate of 58%. Practical application of the novel standard protocol seems to facilitate ECLS weaning and to improve its success rate. The protocol can be administered as part of standard bedside ICU assessment.

N2  - Technological innovations in pediatric extracorporeal life support circuits can reduce system-related complications and may improve patients' outcome. The Deltastream DP3 (Medos Medizintechnik AG, Stolberg, Germany) is a novel rotational pump with a diagonally streamed impeller that can be used over a broad range of flows. We collected patient data from seven pediatric centers to conduct a retrospective cohort study. We examined 233 patients whose median age was 1.9 (0–201) months. The DP3 system was used for cardiopulmonary support as veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) in 162 patients. Respiratory support via veno-venous ECMO was provided in 63 patients. The pump was used as a ventricular assist device in eight patients. Median supporting time was 5.5 (0.2–69) days and the weaning rate was 72.5%. The discharge home rate was 62% in the pulmonary group versus 55% in the cardiac group. Extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation was carried out in 24 patients (10%) with a survival to discharge of rate of 37.5%. About 106 (47%) children experienced no complications, while 33% suffered bleeding requiring blood transfusion or surgical intervention. Three patients suffered a fatal cerebral event. Renal replacement therapy was performed in 28% and pump or oxygenator exchange in 26%. Multivariable analysis identified system exchange (OR 1.94), kidney failure (OR 3.43), and complications on support (OR 2.56) as risk factors for dismal outcome. This novel diagonal pump has demonstrated its efficacy in all kinds of mechanical circulatory and respiratory support, revealing good survival rates.

N2  - Objectives: The impact of different extracorporeal circulation (ECC) scenarios on arterial blood flow profiles and resulting wall shear stress values remains yet unclear. To allow for exact blood flow profile measurements, magnetic resonance imaging during ECC is required. Therefore, the present feasibility study aimed at developing an animal model of ECC that can be examined by means of magnetic resonance imaging. Methods: New Zealand White rabbits (n = 2; 4 kg body weight) were used to realize this model, since in rabbits, atherosclerosis can be additionally induced for future investigations. To enable high resolution magnetic resonance imaging, we developed an extracorporeal circuit of a total length of 20 m so that the blood pump and control unit of the heart lung machine can be placed outside of the strong magnetic field. The miniaturized ECC system via thoracic access comprised an infant oxygenator (Medtronic Affinity Pixie), a pulsatile centrifugal pump (Medos Deltastream DP3), 1/8” tubes, a 10 Fr aortic cannula and a 12 Fr venous two-stage cannula for vacuum-assisted drainage. Results: We generated a miniaturized ECC system with a very low priming volume (240ml) to reduce the system-inherent hemodilution to ∼1:1. Consequently, hemoglobin rates were higher than 6 g/dl and adequate oxygenation could be obtained. Optimized venous drainage by an additionally inserted pulmonary vein vent catheter (6 Fr) resulted in sufficient blood flow (300 ml/min) that was maintained for more than 60 minutes as either pulsatile or non-pulsatile flow. Conclusions: The developed miniaturized extracorporeal circuit guarantees adequate perfusion in rabbits while allowing for simultaneous magnetic resonance imaging. Thus, for the first time, real time blood flow profile measurements during ECC would be possible. Furthermore, this model could be used for validating and optimizing blood flow simulation algorithms to compare the impact of different ECC scenarios without further animal experiments.

N2  - Low cardiac output syndrome and the systemic inflammatory response are consequences of the cardiac surgical perioperative course. The mechanisms responsible are multifactorial, but recent studies have shown that nitric oxide (NO) may be a key component in mitigating some of these processes. Following on from literature reports detailing the use of inhaled NO added to the gas phase of the extracorporeal circuit, we set about developing a technique to perform this addition safely and efficiently. In the setting of cardiopulmonary bypass, the technique was validated in a randomized prospective trial looking at 198 children. The benefits observed in this trial then stimulated the incorporation of NO into all extracorporeal life support (ECLS) circuits. This required additional hardware modifications all of which were able to be performed safely. Initial results from the first series of ECLS patients using NO also appear promising.

N2  - Objective: Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is a lifesaving intervention for pediatric patients with respiratory and/or cardiovascular failure. In this study, we evaluated the cardiac catheterization results of pediatric patients on ECMO support. Methods: Between January 2012 and October 2016, 98 patients (5.2% of all surgery patients) needed ECMO support during perioperative cardiac surgery. We retrospectively reviewed the clinical data of 16 patients who underwent cardiac catheterization under ECMO support. Results: The median age at catheterization was 6.5 months (range, 3.3–60 months), and the median weight was 6.0 kg (range, 3.7–16 kg). Eight of the catheterizations were diagnostic, and the remaining eight were interventional. Five out of these eight patients underwent surgical palliation after diagnostic catheterization. Right pulmonary artery (RPA) stenting, right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) stenting, combined left pulmonary artery (LPA) and RVOT stenting, combined LPA and modified Blalock-Taussig shunt stenting, bilateral pulmonary artery balloon angioplasty, and bilateral pulmonary artery stenting were each performed once, whereas LPA stenting was performed in two different patients. In one patient undergoing RVOT stenting, a complete atrioventricular block developed, resulting in hypotension; however, this was overcome with an ECMO flow increase. In another patient, the ECMO tubing disconnected from the arterial line. Minor vascular complications were seen in three patients. Twelve patients (75%) were successfully weaned from ECMO after the procedure and ten (63%) were discharged. Conclusion: Diagnostic and interventional cardiac catheterization can be safely and effectively performed in patients on ECMO. If the patient cannot be weaned from ECMO support, clinicians should consider performing an early angiogram either to treat or clarify the underlying problem.

The aim of this study was to analyze the safety and feasibility of the Medos Deltastream diagonal pump (DP3) ECLS system in pediatric cardiac patients. We described the technical considerations and risk factors related to the survival outcomes in 102 pediatric cardiac patients who received ECLS support between March 2011 and April 2016. We switched from the DP2 system, which was used for the initial 25 patients, to the DP3 system after November 2012. The DP3 was then used in a consecutive series of 77 patients (4.5% of all pediatric patients who underwent congenital heart surgery during the same time period). The patients’ median age was 90 days (range: 2 days–12 years), while their median weight was 4 kg (range: 2.1–40 kg). Fifty four patients (70%) were weaned off ECLS, while 28 patients (36.3%) were successfully discharged from the hospital by means of the DP3 system. The median ECLS duration for survivors was 8.2 days (range: 4–14.5 days). The ECLS indications, durations, and initiation times had no statistical significance in terms of survival. Renal, hemorrhagic, and neurologic complications were all associated with decreased hospital discharge rates (P = 0.003, P = 0.045, and P < 0.001 respectively). Higher lactate levels (P = 0.009) and longer duration for normalization (P < 0.001) were both associated to failure to wean off ECLS support and, hence, to hospital deaths. The weaning rate was 36% prior to November 2012. It increased to 70.3% after that time (P = 0.009). The mechanical complication rate was 9% with the DP3 system and 32% with the DP2, which was statistically significant (P = 0.009). Additionally, the lactate levels were higher and decreased more slowly in the patients supported by the DP2. As a result of the shift to the DP3 system, a revised ECLS protocol, and increased ECLS experience, a significant improvement was observed in our clinical outcomes. The results of this study suggested that the combination of a DP3 pump and a Hilite oxygenator in pediatric ECLS circuits may improve durability and reduce circuit-induced complications.

N2  - Background and Aims: Continuous venovenous hemofiltration or hemodiafiltration is used frequently in pediatric patients, but experience of continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) application on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) circuit is still limited. Among several methods used for applying CRRT on ECMO patients, we aim to share our experience on inclusion of a CRRT device in the ECMO circuit which we believe is easier and safer to apply. Materials and Methods: The data were collected on demographics, outcomes, and details of the treatment of ECMO patients who had CRRT. During the study period of 3 years, venous cannula of ECMO circuit before pump was used for CRRT access for both the filter inlet and outlet of CRRT machine to minimize the thromboembolic complications. The common indication for CRRT was fluid overload. Results: CRRT was used in 3.68% of a total number of patients admitted and 43% of patients on ECMO. The patients have undergone renal replacement therapy for periods of time ranging between 24 h and 25 days (260 h mean). The survival rate of this group of patients with multiorgan failure was 33%. Renal recovery occurred in all of the survivors. Complications such as electrolyte imbalance, hypothermia, and bradykinin syndrome were easily managed. Conclusions: Adding a CRRT device on ECMO circuit is a safe and effective technique. The major advantages of this technique are easy to access, applying CRRT without extra anticoagulation process, preventing potential hemodynamic disturbances, and increased clearance of solutes and fluid overload using larger hemofilter.

N2  - (Table presented) The first ECMO programme was started in Hacettepe University Ihsan Dogramaci Children's Hospital in 2007 and pediatric intensive care unit was assigned as the manager of the programme. In 2013, our center became one of the member of the ELSO. Aim: We were classified our ECMO data retrospectively as two group according to two different protocol used in two different time interval.We compared complication rate, ECMO running time, wean, survival, hospital discharges between two protocol. Method: Totally thirty-five patients was observed on ECMO between 2013-2016. We classified the patients as group-I who were on ECMO between 2013-2014 and the group-II were between 2015-2016. Results: Fifty-three percent of 35 patient were girl, rest them were boy.Mean age of group-I was 32 month, group-II was 71 month. Sixty percent of group-I had ECMO for post-operative cardiac stunn. In group-I all of the ECMO cannulation were central (aorta-right atrium) and veno-arterial. In group-I coagulation followed by ACT level and the target ACT level was between 180 and 220. Most common complication was bleeding in group-I (50%). The second most common complication was heparin induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) (40%) in group-I. Hypofibrinogenemia was seen in 30 % of group-I patients. In group-II, new type of pediatric (congenital diaphragmatic hernia and ARDS) and adult patient were include ECMO programme beside post-operative cardiac patients. In group-II, most of the cannulations were central and veno-arterial. Six % of patients had double lumen cannula for V-V ECMO but because of low flow rate and severe complication such as cardiac tamponate it seems unsuccesful. In group-II heparine protochol was changed and target of ACT level was adjusted according to the patients age. Bleeding was decrease in group-II (30%) (p< 0.001). Plasma-exchange on ECMO circuit and intravenous immunoglobuline (IVIG) were used in the treatment of HIT in group-II. By using new heparine protocol and new treatment approaches, HIT was down to 22 % of patients in group-II as compared group-I (p<0.001). All of the pump were centrifugal pump (70%of themMedos DP3, 30% of them Macque Rotaflow). We used pulsatile flow in forty%of patient (Medos MDS Deltastream Pulsatile Flow). In both group-I and group-II ECMO success was over 50 percent (group-I wean: 50%, discharge: 40%, in group-II survival: 53%, discharge :46%) and the best pediatric ECMO result in Turkey. Conclusion: Our center is a new ECMO center. We have some serious problem to obtain ECMO cannula in Turkey. We use cardiopulmonary bypass cannule for ECMO. Central cannulation may seems as more invasive but it seems more suitable for our center. We changed our protocol according to observed complication. We have the best known results in pediatric ECMO in Turkey. As a conclusion every center should have a suitable ECMO protocol for their own center to achieve better results.

N2  - Neurologic complications during neonatal extracorporeal life support (ECLS) are associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Gaseous microemboli (GME) in the ECLS circuit may be a possible cause. Advances in neonatal circuitry may improve hemodynamic performance and GME handling leading to reduction in patient complications. This study compared hemodynamic performance and GME handling using two centrifugal pumps (Maquet RotaFlow and Medos Deltastream DP3) and polymethylpentene oxygenators (Maquet Quadrox-iD and Medos Hilite 800LT) in a neonatal ECLS circuit model. The experimental circuit was primed with Lactated Ringer's solution and packed human red blood cells (hematocrit 40%) and arranged in parallel with the RotaFlow and DP3 pump, Quadrox-iD and Hilite oxygenator, and Better-Bladder. Hemodynamic trials evaluating pressure drops and total hemodynamic energy (THE) were conducted at 300 and 500 mL/min at 36°C. GME handling was measured after 0.5 mL of air was injected into the venous line using the Emboli Detection and Classification Quantifier System with unique pump, oxygenator, and Better-Bladder combinations. The RotaFlow pump and Quadrox oxygenator arrangement had lower pressure drops and THE loss at both flow rates compared to the DP3 pump and Hilite oxygenator (P < 0.01). Total GME volume and counts decreased with Better-Bladder at both flow rates with all combinations (P < 0.01). Hemodynamic performance and energy loss were similar in all of the circuit combinations. The Better-Bladder significantly decreased GME. All four combinations of pumps and oxygenators also performed similarly in terms of GME handling.

N2  - The objective of this study was to evaluate the hemodynamic performance and energy transmission of flexible arterial tubing as the arterial line in a simulated pediatric pulsatile extracorporeal life support (ECLS) system. The ECLS circuit consisted of a Medos Deltastream DP3 diagonal pump head, Medos Hilite 2400 LT oxygenator, Biomedicus arterial/venous cannula (10 Fr/14 Fr), 3 feet of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) arterial tubing or latex rubber arterial tubing, primed with lactated Ringer's solution and packed red blood cells (hematocrit 40%). Trials were conducted at flow rates of 300 to 1200 mL/min (300 mL/min increments) under nonpulsatile and pulsatile modes at 36°C using either PVC arterial tubing (PVC group) or latex rubber tubing (Latex group). Real-time pressure and flow data were recorded using a custom-based data acquisition system. Mean pressures and energy equivalent pressures (EEP) were the same under nonpulsatile mode between the two groups. Under pulsatile mode, EEPs were significantly great than mean pressure, especially in the Latex group (P < 0.05). There was no difference between the two groups with regards to pressure drops across ECLS circuit, but pulsatile flow created more pressure drops than nonpulsatile flow (P < 0.05). Surplus hemodynamic energy (SHE) levels were always higher in the Latex group than in the PVC group at all sites. Although total hemodynamic energy (THE) losses were higher under pulsatile mode compared to nonpulsatile mode, more THE was delivered to the pseudopatient, particularly in the Latex group (P < 0.05). The results showed that the flexible arterial tubing retained more hemodynamic energy passing through it under pulsatile mode while mean pressures and pressure drops across the ECLS circuit were similar between PVC and latex rubber arterial tubing. Further studies are warranted to verify our findings.

N2  - Objectives: Renal dysfunction is commonly seen after CABG. Novel urinary biomarkers have been introduced for early detection of renal structural damage. The effect of pulsatile perfusion mode in minimized CPB on urinary biomarkers has not yet been studied. Methods: Forty patients with normal kidney function scheduled for elective or urgent multivessel CABG were randomized to either pulsatile (pp) or continuous (cp) perfusion mode. Pulsatility was accomplished using the MINI. SYSTEM 1.0 (Medos AG) containing the Deltastream DP3 diagonal flow pump, which enables pump flow variations of 5.000 rpm at pulse rates between 40 and 90 bpm. For the study, pulse rate was set at 40 bpm with a 25% systolic rise in steepness. Pulsatile mode was switched on during cardiac arrest. Levels of Kidney Injury Molecule-1 (KIM1), Neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL), Liver-type fatty acid-binding protein (L-FABP), and Alpha glutathione S transferase (αGST) were determined in the patient's urine at baseline and up to 72 hours postoperatively. Results: The groups were homogenous in terms of gender (pp: 19 m, 3 f; cp: 15 m, 3 f), age (pp: 64 ± 10 years, cp: 67 ± 8 years), and bypass grafts per patient (pp: 3.5 ± 1.1, cp: 3.6 ± 1.0). Perfusion and cross clamp times were comparable (pp: 102 ± 19 minutes and 57 ± 12 minutes; cp: 108 ± 30 minutes and 55 ± 13 minutes). Pulsatile mode created a mean pulse pressure amplitude of 24.0 ± 1.8 mm Hg leaving the mean arterial pressure unaffected (pp: 62.7 ± 4.2 mm Hg; cp: 66.4 ± 3.0 mm Hg, p = 0.066). Pulsatile mode did not interfere with surgery. None of the patients revealed signs of renal failure after surgery. Levels of urinary biomarkers were elevated after surgery but did not exhibit differences between the groups (p values KIM1: 0.964; NGAL: 0.547; L-FABP: 0.303; αGST: 0.436). Conclusion: Adding pulsatility to minimized extracorporeal circulation had no measurable effect on urinary biomarkers in this study on patients with normal kidney function. However, it could be shown that pulsatility can easily be implemented during CABG with MECC. Further research is warranted with optimized pulse settings on patients with pre-existing renal impairment.

N2  - A mock heart circulation loop (MHCL) is a hydraulic model simulating the human circulatory system. It allows in vitro investigations of the interaction between cardiac assist devices and the human circulatory system. In this study, a preload sensitive MHCL, the MHCLAUTO, was developed to investigate the interaction between the left ventricle and left ventricular assist devices (LVADs). The Frank–Starling mechanism was modeled by regulating the stroke volume (SV) based on the measured mean diastolic left atrial pressure (MLAPdiast). The baroreflex autoregulation mechanism was implemented to maintain a constant mean aortic pressure (MAP) by varying ventricular contractility (Emax), heart rate (HR), afterload/systemic vascular resistance (SVR) and unstressed venous volume (UVV). The DP3 blood pump (Medos Medizintechnik GmbH) was used to simulate the LVAD. Characteristic parameters were measured in pathological conditions both with and without LVAD to assess the hemodynamic effect of LVAD on the MHCLAUTO. The results obtained from the MHCLAUTO show a high correlation to literature data. The study demonstrates the possibility of using the MHCLAUTO as a research tool to better understand the physiological interactions between cardiac implants and human circulation.

N2  - This study reports a single-centre experience of the Medos Deltastream diagonal-pump (DP3) for extracorporeal cardiac, pulmonary, or combined support in a single-center pediatric cohort. Twenty-seven consecutive patients with 28 runs of the DP3 between January 2013 and June 2014 were included for analysis. Median patient age, weight, and duration of support were 278 days (range: 0 days-14.2 years), 7.2 kg (range: 2.5-39 kg), and 8 days (range: 2-69 days). Midline sternotomy (n = 20, 71.4%) or cervical approaches (n = 8, 28.6%) were used for cannulation. The DP3 was employed for either veno-arterial extracorporeal life support (ECLS, n = 16), veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO, n = 5), or ventricular assist devices (right ventricular assist device [RVAD], n = 1; left ventricular assist device [LVAD], n = 1; and univentricular assist device [UNIVAD], n = 5). Three patients initially supported with ECLS were switched to UNIVAD and one patient with UNIVAD was changed to ECLS. Required flow for neonates (n = 8) ranged between 0.2 and 0.75 L/min. Irreversible pump damage occurred in one patient during deairing after air block. Successful weaning, 30 day and hospital survival were 89.3% (n = 25), 85.7% (n = 24), and 71.4% (n = 20). All patients on UNIVAD, who did not require further extracorporeal respiratory assist, survived. In conclusion, the DP3 can be used for individual patient demands and adapted to their most suitable method of support. Meticulous flow adjustments render this pump highly effective for extracorporeal support particularly in pediatric patients.

N2  - Purpose: Extracorporeal life support (ECLS) is a lifesaving mechanical circulatory support that has become an accepted therapeutic modality for neonates and children afflicted with respiratory and/or cardiac failure that is refractory to conventional management. The Deltastream® DP3 (Medos Medizintechnik AG, Stolberg, Germany) is a newly designed rotational pump with a diagonally streamed impeller that can be used in children of all ages. The aim of this study was to analyze the safety and feasibility of this novel diagonal ECLS System. Methods: Between March, 2011 and May, 2015 89 patients underwent ECLS support. We switched to DP3 after November, 2012, and DP3 was used in a consecutive series of 64 patients (almost 5% of all children undergoing congenital heart surgery at same period). We retrospectively reviewed medical records of patients to study. Results: ECLS with the DP3 was performed in 64 patients (30 females, 34 males). The patients' age was a median of 90 days (2\-4320 days). The patients' weight was a median of 3.8 kg (2.1-40 kg). Indications for ECLS were failure to come off of cardiopulmonary bypass (n =19), postoperative low cardiac output syndrome (n =18), E-CPR (n= 19), and respiratory failure (n=8). Nineteen (29.6%) children had single ventricle, while 45 (70.4%) children had two-ventricle pathology. ECMO indications, durations, and start times had no statistical significance on survival. Complications included cardiopulmonary (n = 41.64%), neurologic (n=18, %28), infectious (n =27, 42%), pulmonary (n=19, 29%), renal (n =34, 54%), hemorrhagic (n =35, 54%) and mechanical (n =6, <10%). Median ECMO duration was 6.4 (range 4-41) days. ECMO was successfully weaned in 45 (70.3%) patients, 24(37.5%) patients survived to hospital discharge and 21 patients (32.8%) died after successful weaning. While the weaning success rate was 36% and the survival rate 20% before November 2012. Conclusions: The combination of a DP3 pump and a Hilite 800LT oxygenator in pediatric ECMO circuits may improve durability and reduce circuit-induced complications. As a result of shift from DP2 to DP3, revision of ECMO protocol and increased ECMO experience, significant improvement was observed in our clinical results.

N2  - Background: Neurologic complications secondary to neonatal ECLS are associated with significant morbidity and mortality. While these complications are likely multifactorial, gaseous microemboli (GME) in the ECLS circuit may be a possible cause. Advances in neonatal circuitry may improve hemodynamic performance and GME handling leading to reduction in patient complications. Objective: In this study we compared two different centrifugal pumps (Maquet RotaFlow and Medos Deltastream DP3) and oxygenators (Maquet Quadrox-iD and Medos Hilite LT) on hemodynamic performance, specifically pressure drops and total hemodynamic energy (THE) levels and GME handling in a neonatal ECLS circuit model. [Figure Presented] Methods: The experimental circuit consisted of the Maquet RotaFlow pump, Quadrox-iD Pediatric oxygenator, Medos Deltastream DP3 pump, Hilite 800 LT oxygenator, and the Better-Bladder arranged in parallel using a "Y" connector. The circuit was primed with lactated Ringer's solution and packed human red blood cells with hematocrit 40%. Hemodynamic trials collecting real-time pressure and flow data were conducted at flow rates of 300 and 500 ml/min at 368C. To evaluate GME handling, 0.5cc of air was injected into the venous line testing 8 unique combinations of pump and oxygenator with or without the Better Bladder at both flow rates. The Emboli Detection and Classification Quantifier (EDAC) System was used for GME detection and size characterization. Results: THE levels at pre-oxygenator and post-arterial cannula sites and GME handling results are displayed below in Figure 1 and Table 1 respectively. Conclusions: The RotaFlow centrifugal pump and Quadrox iD oxygenator circuit arrangement had the best hemodynamic performance with significantly lower pressure drops and THE loss. Conversely, the Medos Deltastream DP3 pump and Hilite LT oxygenator with the Better-Bladder had better GME handling except at the slower flow rate of 300 ml/min. The Better-Bladder significantly decreased GME at all stages of the experiment. Further in vivo studies are necessary to validate these findings.

N2  - Objective: The objective of this study was to evaluate the hemodynamic performance and energy transmission of flexible arterial tubing as the arterial line in a simulated pediatric pulsatile ECLS system. Methods: The ECLS circuit consisted of a Medos Deltastream DP3 diagonal pump head, Medos Hilite 2400 LT oxygenator, Biomedicus arterial/venous cannula (10Fr/14Fr), 3 feet of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) arterial tubing or latex rubber arterial tubing, primed with lactated ringer's solution and packed red blood cells (hematocrit 40%). Trials were conducted at flow rates of 300 to 1200 ml/min (300ml/min increments) under non-pulsatile and pulsatile modes at 368C using either PVC arterial tubing (PVC group) or latex rubber tubing (Latex group). Real-time pressure and flow data were recorded using a custom-based data acquisition system. Results: Mean pressures and energy equivalent pressures (EEP) were the same under non-pulsatile mode between two groups. Under pulsatile mode, EEPs were significantly great than mean pressure, especially in the Latex group (p<0.05). There was no difference between the two groups with regards to pressure drops across ECLS circuit, but pulsatile flow created more pressure drops than non-pulsatile flow (p<0.05). Surplus hemodynamic energy (SHE) levels were always higher in the Latex group than in the PVC group at all sites. Although total hemodynamic energy (THE) losses were higher under pulsatile mode compared to non-pulsatile mode, more THEs were delivered to the pseudopatient, particularly in the Latex group (p<0.05) (Figure 1). [Figure Presented] Conclusions: The results showed that the flexible arterial tubing retained more hemodynamic energy passing through it under pulsatile mode while mean pressures and pressure drops across the ECLS circuit were similar between PVC and latex rubber arterial tubing. Further studies are warranted to verify our findings.

N2  - Objective: Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation is a rescue therapy for patients with severe lung failure. Major complications caused by extracorporeal membrane oxygenation are bleeding, thrombosis, and hemolysis. The aim of this study was to compare the impact of different extracorporeal membrane oxygenation systems on blood hemostasis in adults during veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation therapy. Design: Single center prospective randomized study. Setting: University Hospital Regensburg, Germany. Patients: Adult patients with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome requiring veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation therapy. Interventions: None. Measurements and Main Results: Three different extracorporeal membrane oxygenation systems: the Cardiohelp system (Maquet Cardiopulmonary AG), the Dideco ECC.O5 (Sorin Group), and the Deltastream system with Hilite 7000 LT + DP3 pumphead (Medos Medizintechnik AG) were compared. Therefore hemostasis, anticoagulation, hemolysis, and inflammatory parameters were monitored. Of the 54 patients included in the study, 18 patients each were randomly assigned to the three different extracorporeal membrane oxygenation systems. Exclusion criteria were acute renal failure, trauma, and surgery within 2 days. The median time on veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support was 13.5 days (4-70 d). Median platelet count had dropped from 220.5 G/L before extracorporeal membrane oxygenation therapy to a minimum of 133 G/L by the last day of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support. During the first 5 days of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation therapy, prothrombin fragment 1.2 (F1.2) (1.36-2.4 μM), thrombin-antithrombin complex (14.5-50 μg/L), and D-dimers (6.00-27.0 mg/L) increased, whereas fibrinogen values dropped from 5.8 to 4.1 g/L. The three different extracorporeal membrane oxygenation systems did not show any differences with regard to hemostasis, anticoagulation, hemolysis, and inflammatory parameters within the first 5 days of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation therapy. Conclusions: Over time, miniaturized veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation therapy increasingly activates coagulation. The different types of membrane oxygenators and pumps did not significantly alter hemostasis.

N2  - The objective of this study was to compare the systemic inflammatory response and hemolytic characteristics of a conventional roller pump (HL20-NP) and an alternative diagonal pump with nonpulsatile (DP3-NP) and pulsatile mode (DP3-P) in simulated neonatal extracorporeal life support (ECLS) systems. The experimental neonatal ECLS circuits consist of a conventional Jostra HL20 roller pump or an alternative Medos DP3 diagonal pump, and Medos Hilite 800 LT hollow-fiber oxygenator with diffusion membrane. Eighteen sterile circuits were primed with freshly donated whole blood and divided into three groups: conventional HL20 with nonpulsatile flow (HL20-NP), DP3 with nonpulsatile flow (DP3-NP), and DP3 with pulsatile flow (DP3-P). All trials were conducted for durations of 12h at a flow rate of 500mL/min at 36°C. Simultaneous blood flow and pressure waveforms were recorded. Blood samples were collected to measure plasma-free hemoglobin (PFH), human tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-6 (IL-6), and IL-8, in addition to the routine blood gas, lactate dehydrogenase, and lactic acid levels. HL20-NP group had the highest PFH levels (mean±standard error of the mean) after a 12-h ECLS run, but the difference among groups did not reach statistical significance (HL20-NP group: 907.6±253.1mg/L, DP3-NP group: 343.7±163.2mg/L, and DP3-P group: 407.6±156.6mg/L, P=0.06). Although there were similar trends but no statistical differences for the levels of proinflammatory cytokines among the three groups, the HL20-NP group had much greater levels than the other groups (P>0.05). Pulsatile flow generated higher total hemodynamic energy and surplus hemodynamic energy levels at pre-oxygenator and pre-clamp sites (P<0.01). Our study demonstrated that the alternative diagonal pump ECLS circuits appeared to have less systemic inflammatory response and hemolysis compared with the conventional roller pump ECLS circuit in simulated neonatal ECLS systems. Pulsatile flow delivered more hemodynamic energy to the pseudo-patient without increased odds of hemolysis compared with the conventional, nonpulsatile roller pump group.

N2  - The objective of this study is to evaluate two extracorporeal life support (ECLS) circuits and determine the effect of pulsatile flow on pressure drop, flow/pressure waveforms, and hemodynamic energy levels in a pediatric pseudopatient. One ECLS circuit consisted of a Medos Deltastream DP3 diagonal pump and Hilite 2400 LT oxygenator with arterial/venous tubing. The second circuit consisted of a Maquet RotaFlow centrifugal pump and Quadrox-iD Pediatric oxygenator with arterial/venous tubing. A 14Fr Medtronic Bio-Medicus one-piece pediatric arterial cannula was used for both circuits. All trials were conducted at flow rates ranging from 500 to 2800mL/min using pulsatile or nonpulsatile flow. The post-cannula pressure was maintained at 50mmHg. Blood temperature was maintained at 36°C. Real-time pressure and flow data were recorded using a custom-based data acquisition system. The results showed that the Deltastream DP3 circuit produced surplus hemodynamic energy (SHE) in pulsatile mode at all flow rates, with greater SHE delivery at lower flow rates. Neither circuit produced SHE in nonpulsatile mode. The Deltastream DP3 pump also demonstrated consistently higher total hemodynamic energy at the pre-oxygenator site in pulsatile mode and a lesser pressure drop across the oxygenator. The Deltastream DP3 pump generated physiological pulsatility without backflow and provided increased hemodynamic energy. This novel ECLS circuit demonstrates suitable in vitro performance and adaptability to a wide range of pediatric patients.

N2  - Background: Interhospital transfer of patients experiencing circulatory failure and shock has a significant risk of cardiovascular deterioration and death. Extracorporeal life support (ECLS) is a rescue tool for hemodynamic stabilization that makes patient transportation much safer. Methods: Demographic data, clinical course, and outcome data were reviewed for patients who underwent placement of a venoarterial ECLS in a remote hospital and were transported to our tertiary care facility. Results: 68 patients were transported to our center with ECLS. The majority of these patients (79%) underwent cardiopulmonary resuscitation during or immediately prior to ECLS initiation. The mean patient age was 52 years, and 53 patients were male. The most common underlying diagnosis was acute coronary syndrome (60%). Overall, 23 patients underwent consecutive cardiosurgical procedures, including coronary artery bypass grafting in 12, and left ventricular assist device and biventricular assist device implantation in 11. The median duration of ECLS was 5 days. None of the patients died during transportation. Twelve of the surgically treated patients survived, as well as 21 patients with non-surgical treatment, which resulted in an overall survival of 33 patients (48.5%). Conclusion: ECLS-facilitated patient transfer enables safe interhospital transfer of critically ill patients. In this study, a relevant percentage of patients were in need of a cardiosurgical intervention. The long-term survival rate of these patients supports the further use of this time-, cost- and personnel-demanding strategy.

N2  - Objectives Left ventricular assist devices are an important treatment option for patients with heart failure alter the hemodynamics in the heart and great vessels. Because in vivo magnetic resonance studies of patients with ventricular assist devices are not possible, in vitro models represent an important tool to investigate flow alterations caused by these systems. By using an in vitro magnetic resonance-compatible model that mimics physiologic conditions as close as possible, this work investigated the flow characteristics using 4-dimensional flow-sensitive magnetic resonance imaging of a left ventricular assist device with outflow via the right subclavian artery as commonly used in cardiothoracic surgery in the recent past. Methods An in vitro model was developed consisting of an aorta with its supra-aortic branches connected to a left ventricular assist device simulating the pulsatile flow of the native failing heart. A second left ventricular assist device supplied the aorta with continuous flow via the right subclavian artery. Four-dimensional flow-sensitive magnetic resonance imaging was performed for different flow rates of the left ventricular assist device simulating the native heart and the left ventricular assist device providing the continuous flow. Flow characteristics were qualitatively and quantitatively evaluated in the entire vessel system. Results Flow characteristics inside the aorta and its upper branching vessels revealed that the right subclavian artery and the right carotid artery were solely supported by the continuous-flow left ventricular assist device for all flow rates. The flow rates in the brain-supplying arteries are only marginally affected by different operating conditions. The qualitative analysis revealed only minor effects on the flow characteristics, such as weakly pronounced vortex flow caused by the retrograde flow via the brachiocephalic artery. Conclusions The results indicate that, despite the massive alterations in natural hemodynamics due to the retrograde flow via the right subclavian and brachiocephalic arteries, there are no drastic consequences on the flow in the brain-feeding arteries and the flow characteristics in the ascending and descending aortas. It may be beneficial to adjust the operating condition of the left ventricular assist device to the residual function of the failing heart.

N2  - Objectives: Technical complications are a known hazard in veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (vvECMO). Identifying these complications and predictive factors indicating a developing system-exchange was the goal of the study. Methods: Retrospective study on prospectively collected data of technical complications including 265 adult patients (Regensburg ECMO Registry, 2009-2013) with acute respiratory failure treated with vvECMO. Alterations in blood flow resistance, gas transfer capability, hemolysis, coagulation and hemostasis parameters were evaluated in conjunction with a system-exchange in all patients with at least one exchange (n=83). Results: Values presented as median (interquartile range). Patient age was 50(36-60) years, the SOFA score 11(8-14.3) and the Murray lung injury Score 3.33(3.3-3.7). Cumulative ECMO support time 3411 days, 9(6-15) days per patient. Mechanical failure of the blood pump (n=5), MO (n=2) or cannula (n=1) accounted for 10% of the exchanges. Acute clot formation within the pump head (visible clots, increase in plasma free hemoglobin (frHb), serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), n=13) and MO (increase in pressure drop across the MO, n=16) required an urgent system-exchange, of which nearly 50% could be foreseen by measuring the parameters mentioned below. Reasons for an elective system-exchange were worsening of gas transfer capability (n=10) and device-related coagulation disorders (n=32), either local fibrinolysis in the MO due to clot formation (increased D-dimers [DD]), decreased platelet count; n=24), or device-induced hyperfibrinolysis (increased DD, decreased fibrinogen [FG], decreased platelet count, diffuse bleeding tendency; n=8), which could be reversed after system-exchange. Four MOs were exchanged due to suspicion of infection. Conclusions: The majority of ECMO system-exchanges could be predicted by regular inspection of the complete ECMO circuit, evaluation of gas exchange, pressure drop across the MO and laboratory parameters (DD, FG, platelets, LDH, frHb). These parameters should be monitored in the daily routine to reduce the risk of unexpected ECMO failure.

N2  - During ventricular assist device support, a cannula acts as a bridge between the native cardiovascular system and a foreign mechanical device. Cannula tip design strongly affects the function of the cannula and its potential for blood trauma. In this study, the flow fields of five different tip geometries within the ventricle were evaluated using stereo particle image velocimetry. Inflow cannulae with conventional tip geometries (blunt, blunt with four side ports, beveled with three side ports, and cage) and a custom-designed crown tip were interposed between a mixed-flow rotary blood pump and a compressible, translucent silicone left ventricle. The contractile function of the failing ventricle and hemodynamics were reproduced in a mock circulation loop. The rotary blood pump was interfaced with the ventricle and aorta and used to fully support the failing ventricle. Among these five tip geometries, high-shear volume (γ ˙ ≥ 2778 / s , potential parameter of platelet activation) was found to be the greatest in the blunt tip. The cage tip was observed to have the highest low-shear volume and recirculation volume (γ ˙ ≤ 100 / s and Vz>0, respectively; potential parameters of thrombus formation). The crown tip, together with conventional tip geometries with side ports (blunt with four side ports and beveled with three side ports) showed no significant difference in either high-shear volume or low-shear volume. However, recirculation volume was reduced significantly in the crown tip. Despite limited generalizability to clinical situations, these transient-state measurements supported the potential mitigation of complications by changing the design of conventional cannula tip geometries.

N2  - Objective: The new Medos Deltastream DP3 system includes a diagonal pump and a hollow membrane oxygenator that provides pediatric extracorporeal life support (ECLS). DP3 has been used in Europe and also has different modes including pulsatility. Our ECLS system has been switched from Medos Deltastream DP2 to DP3 since November, 2012. The aim of this study is to investigate the efficiency of this new system. Methods: Between March 2011 and February 2014, the Medos Deltastream ECLS system was used in 55 patients. The system was DP2 in 25 patients before November 2012 and DP3 in 30 patients since then. The mean age was 15.6 months and mean ECLS duration was 3 days in the last 30 patients. Eleven of patients were newborns. E-CPR was needed in 9 of patients. Non-pulsatile flow and preload control mode (P1 control mode) was used in most patients. P1 (between the patient and the pump head), P2 (pre-oxygenator) and P3 (postoxygenator) pressures were followed up in all patients. Results: In DP2 group, 9 of 25 patients (36%) could be weaned off and 5 patients (20%) were discharged. In DP3 group, 26 of 30 patients (86%) could be weaned off and 15 patients (50%) were discharged. Bleeding and renal failure were the most common complications during ECMO support. Hemodynamic stability, lactate levels and urine output were better in DP3 patients. Conclusions: DP3 success is still in progress in comparison with DP2. DP3 provides better hemodynamic stability during support. Also, using proper modes increase efficiency of support. (Figure Presented).

N2  - Objective: One approach with the potential to improve morbidity and mortality rates following extracorporeal life support (ECLS) is the use of pulsatile perfusion. Currently, no ECLS pumps used in the United States can produce pulsatile flow. The objective of this experiment is to evaluate a novel diagonal pump used in Europe to determine whether it provides physiological pulsatility in a neonatal model. Methods: The ECLS circuit consisted of a Medos Deltastream DP3 diagonal pump, a Hilite 800LT polymethylpentene diffusion membrane oxygenator, and arterial/venous tubing. A 300-mL pseudopatient was connected to the circuit using an 8Fr arterial cannula and a 10Fr venous cannula. A clamp maintained constant pressure entering the pseudopatient. The circuit was primed using lactated Ringer's solution and packed human red blood cells (HCT 35%). Trials (64 totals) were conducted in nonpulsatile and pulsatile modes at flow rates of 200 mL/ min to 800 mL/min. Flow and pressure data were collected using a custom-based data acquisition system. Results: The Deltastream DP3 pump was capable of producing adequate quality of pulsatility (Figure 1). Pulsatile flow produced increased mean arterial pressure, energy equivalent pressure (EEP), and surplus hemodynamic energy (SHE) at all flow rates compared to nonpulsatile flow (Figure 2). Pressure drop across the cannula accounted for the majority of pressure loss in the circuit. The greatest loss of SHE and total hemodynamic energy occurred across the arterial cannula due to its small diameter. Conclusions: The Deltastream DP3 pump produced physiological pulsatile flow without backflow while providing EEP and SHE to our neonatal pseudopatient. Further experiments are necessary to determine the impact of this pulsatile pump in an in vivo model prior to clinical use. (Figure Presented).

N2  - Objectives: Extracorporeal life support (ECLS) is a rescue option in critically ill patients. Since fast available and appropriate for respiratory and circulatory failure, it is frequently applied in resuscitation scenarios. Neurological injury is a complication common in ECLS patients limiting outcome, particularly after resuscitation. In this study, the institutional ECLS database was used to correlate neuron-specific enolase (NSE) serum peak values with outcome of patients supported with venoarterial (VA) ECLS during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). Methods: From January 2011 to August 2012, 31 patients were provided with a VA ECLS during CPR (external cardiac massage). Serum NSE peaks were monitored and correlated with neurological outcome and hospital mortality. Patients were divided into two groups with mild-to-moderate and high NSE levels (cut-offvalue 100 μg/l). Results: High NSE levels were seen in 7 patients (mean 218 ± 155 μg/l) and mild-to-moderate levels in 24 patients (50 ± 23 μg/l, P = 0.0001). Duration of extracoporeal support was comparable in both groups (6.3 ± 7.5 vs 5.0 ± 4.5 days, P = n.s.). Patients with mild-to-moderate NSE levels were significantly older than those with high NSE levels (58 ± 16 vs 44 ± 15 years, P = 0.02). Six patients with high NSE levels (86%) developed severe neurological complications. Though 4 patients could be weaned from extracorporeal support, hospital mortality was 86% (6 patients). In contrast, patients with mild-to-moderate NSE levels had a hospital mortality of 46% (11 patients). Eighteen patients (75%) could be weaned from the device, and incidence of major neurological events was 29% (6 patients) only. Serum pH and lactate levels before ECLS implantation were significantly lower in patients with mild-to-moderate NSE values (pH: 7.23 ± 0.04 vs 6.93 ± 0.12, P = 0.039; lactate: 106 ± 11 vs 161 ± 16 mg/l, P = 0.023). Conclusions: High NSE serum levels after ECLS correspond to poor neurological outcome and considerable mortality. Therefore, early neuroimaging is reasonable for determining therapeutic strategies in patients with high NSE peaks after resuscitation and extracorporeal support. © The Author 2013.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: The objective of the study was to assess the cost of using different blood pumps for short-term ventricular assist device (VAD) and extracorporeal life support (ECLS) systems for cardiac and cardiorespiratory failure in the UK. METHODS: The cost analysis presented was based on evaluation of the time required to provide circulatory support for the following indications: post-cardiac surgery cardiogenic shock, postacute myocardial infarction cardiogenic shock, deteriorating end-stage heart failure (ESHF) and the ability of different blood pumps to provide support for the necessary duration. The maximum length of support for each device was based on the manufacturers' recommendations. Direct medical cost of each treatment was evaluated only for the period of mechanical circulatory support in adults and children. Only the cost of device, placement and replacement procedures were considered. List prices were used for devices; resource use was based on expert opinion; unit costs were obtained from official UK sources and Wythenshawe hospital, Manchester, UK. Hospital perspective was utilized for analysis. Three VADs were selected for comparison in adults and two in children. Four centrifugal ECLS systems were selected for comparison in adults and two in children. RESULTS: In both VAD and ECLS indications, the CentriMag® was the least expensive when used for support of patients with end-stage heart failure. Compared with Cardiohelp® for ECLS (which has the same maximum claim duration of support of 30 days), CentriMag® lead to cost savings of £4294 per patient in all three clinical conditions considered. In post-cardiac surgery cardiogenic shock, CentriMag® VAD lead to savings of £5014 per patient compared with BPX-80.

N2  - One challenge in providing extracorporeal circulation is to supply optimal flow while minimising adverse effects, such as haemolysis. To determine if the recent generation constrained vortex pumps with their inherent design improvements would lead to reduced red cell trauma, we undertook a study comparing three devices. Utilizing a simulated short-term ventricular assist circuit primed with whole human blood, we examined changes in plasma free haemoglobin values over a six-day period. The three pumps investigated were the Maquet Rotaflow, the Levitronix PediVAS and the Medos Deltastream DP3.This study demonstrated that all three pumps produced low levels of haemolysis and are suitable for use in a clinical environment. The Levitronix PediVAS was significantly less haemolytic than either the Rotaflow (p<0.05) or the DP3 (p<0.05). There was no significant difference in plasma free haemoglobin between the Rotaflow and the DP3 (p=0.71). © The Author(s) 2014.

N2  - The Medos Deltastream DP3 system is made up of a novel diagonal pump and hollow-membrane oxygenator that provides nonpulsatile and pulsatile flows for extracorporeal life support (ECLS). The objectives of this study are to (i) evaluate the efficacy of the hemodynamic energy provided by Medos Deltastream DP3 system in nonpulsatile and pulsatile mode and (ii) to evaluate the pulsatile mode under different frequencies. The experimental ECLS circuit was used in this study, primed with Ringer's lactate and packed red blood cells (hematocrit 35%). All trials were conducted at flow rates of 500, 1000, 1500, and 2000mL/min with modified pulsatile frequencies of 60, 70, 80, and 90bpm at 36°C. Simultaneous blood flow and pressures at the pre/postoxygenator and pre/postcannula sites were recorded for quantification of the pulsatile perfusion-generated energy-equivalent pressure (EEP), surplus hemodynamic energy (SHE), and total hemodynamic energy (THE). The experiments showed that under pulsatile flow conditions, at all flow rates and frequencies, (i) the EEP, SHE, and THE were significantly higher when compared with the nonpulsatile group and (ii) the pressure drop was minimal at lower flow rates and lower pulsatile frequencies but was significant when either the flow rate or the pulsatile frequency was increased. The Medos Deltastream DP3 System can provide nonpulsatile flow and physiologic quality pulsatile flow for pediatric ECLS.

N2  - Cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) is used for a variety of procedures in pediatric patients. Flow settings of the CPB pump have dramatic effects on patient outcome, and gaseous microemboli delivery within the CPB circuit has been linked to neurological complications. To ensure the ongoing improvement of pediatric CPB, consistent evaluation and improvement of the equipment is necessary. In this study we analyze the Jostra HL-20 roller pump (Jostra USA, Austin, TX, USA) and a Medos Deltastream DP3 diagonal pump (MEDOS Medizintechnik AG, Stolberg, Germany) which has not yet received Food and Drug Administration approval. An infant CPB model with heparinized human blood is used to quantify the gaseous microemboli delivery (via an Emboli Detection and Classification Quantifier), as well as the hemodynamic energy delivered under flow rates of 400, 800, and 1200mL/min. Results show that at most flow settings the DP3 delivers fewer microemboli than the Jostra roller pump at the pre-oxygenator site, with an exception at 1200mL/min under pulsatile mode. The total volume and the number of gaseous microemboli greater than 40μm in diameter were lower in the DP3 group. The HL-20 exhibits less stolen blood flow (except at 1200mL/min) and oxygenator pressure drops in both pulsatile and nonpulsatile mode. Additionally, under pulsatile flow the DP3 delivers greater surplus hemodynamic energy. Both pumps produce relatively few microemboli and deliver adequate hemodynamic energy to the pseudo-patient, with the DP3 performing slightly better under most flow settings. © 2013, the Authors.

N2  - The objective of this study was to evaluate the pump performance of the third-generation Medos diagonal pump, the Deltastream DP3, on hemodynamic profile and pulsatility in a simulated pediatric mechanical circulatory support (MCS) system. The experimental circuit consisted of a Medos Deltastream DP3 pump head and console (MEDOS Medizintechnik AG, Stolberg, Germany), a 14-Fr Terumo TenderFlow Pediatric arterial cannula and a 20-Fr Terumo TenderFlow Pediatric venous return cannula (Terumo Corporation, Tokyo, Japan), and 3ft of tubing with an internal diameter ofin. for both arterial and venous lines. Trials were conducted at flow rates ranging from 250mL/min to 1000mL/min (250-mL/min increments) and rotational speeds ranging from 1000 to 4000rpm (1000-rpm increments) using human blood (hematocrit 40%). The postcannula pressure was maintained at 60mmHg by a Hoffman clamp. Real-time pressure and flow data were recorded using a Labview-based acquisition system. The pump provided adequate nonpulsatile and pulsatile flow, created more hemodynamic energy under pulsatile mode, and generated higher positive and negative pressures when the inlet and outlet of the pump head, respectively, were clamped. After the conversion from nonpulsatile to pulsatile mode, the flow rates and the rotational speeds increased. In conclusion, the novel Medos Deltastream DP3 diagonal pump is able to supply the required flow rate for pediatric MCS, generate adequate quality of pulsatility, and provide surplus hemodynamic energy output in a simulated pediatric MCS system. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. and International Center for Artificial Organs and Transplantation.

N2  - One approach with the potential to improve morbidity and mortality rates following extracorporeal life support (ECLS) is the use of pulsatile perfusion. Currently, no ECLS pumps used in the United States can produce pulsatile flow. The objective of this experiment is to evaluate a novel diagonal pump used in Europe to determine whether it provides physiological pulsatility in a neonatal model. The ECLS circuit consisted of a Medos Deltastream DP3 diagonal pump, a Hilite 800LT polymethylpentene diffusion membrane oxygenator, and arterial/venous tubing. A 300-mL pseudopatient was connected to the circuit using an 8Fr arterial cannula and a 10Fr venous cannula. A clamp maintained constant pressure entering the pseudopatient. Trials (64 total) were conducted in nonpulsatile and pulsatile modes at flow rates of 200mL/min to 800mL/min. Flow and pressure data were collected using a custom-based data acquisition system. The Deltastream DP3 pump was capable of producing an adequate quality of pulsatility. Pulsatile flow produced increased mean arterial pressure, energy equivalent pressure (EEP), and surplus hemodynamic energy (SHE) at all flow rates compared to nonpulsatile flow. Pressure drop across the cannula accounted for the majority of pressure loss in the circuit. The greatest loss of SHE and total hemodynamic energy occurred across the arterial cannula due to its small diameter. The Deltastream DP3 pump produced physiological pulsatile flow without backflow while providing EEP and SHE to our neonatal pseudopatient. Further experiments are necessary to determine the impact of this pulsatile pump in an in vivo model prior to clinical use. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. and International Center for Artificial Organs and Transplantation.

N2  - Background: The objective of this study was to evaluate the pump performance of the novel diagonal Medos Deltastream DP3 diagonal pump (MEDOS Medizintechnik AG, , Stolberg, Germany) under nonpulsatile to pulsatile mode with varying differential speed values in a simulated pediatric extracorporeal life support system. Methods: The experimental circuit consisted of a Medos Deltastream DP3 pump head and console, a Medos Hilite 2400 LT hollow fiber membrane oxygenator (MEDOS Medizintechnik AG), a 14F Medtronic DLP arterial cannula (Medtronic Inc, Minnesota), and a 20F Terumo TenderFlow Pediatric venous return cannula (Terumo Corporation, Michigan). Trials were conducted at flow rates ranging from 500 mL/min to 2,000 mL/min (500 mL/min increments) and pulsatile differential speed values ranging from 500 rpm to 2,500 rpm (500 rpm increments) using human blood (hematocrit 35%). The postcannula pressure was maintained constantly at 60 mm Hg. Real-time pressure and flow data were recorded using a custom-made data acquisition system and Labview software. Results: Under all experimental conditions, pulsatile flow (P) generated significantly greater energy equivalent pressure (EEP), surplus hemodynamic energy (SHE), and total hemodynamic energy (THE) than those of nonpulsatile flow (NP). Under NP, SHE was zero. Higher differential speed values generated greater EEP, SHE, and THE values. There was little variation in the oxygenator pressure drop and the cannula pressure drop in P, compared to NP. Conclusions: The novel Medos Deltastream DP3 diagonal pump is able to generate physiological quality of P, without backflow. With increased differential rpm, the pump generated greater EEP, SHE, and THE. Physiological quality of pulsatility may be associated with better microcirculation because of greater EEP, SHE, and THE.

N2  - Background: Although pulsatile circulation is natural for humans the real benefit of pulsatile blood pumps during shortterm and long-term circulatory support is still uncertain. The aim of the study was to evaluate a relationship between hemodynamic characteristics of pump-generated pulsatile blood flow, its endothelial effects and internal organs perfusion quality. Methods: Thirty seven patients (age 80 ± 3.3 years) were prospectively randomized for heart surgery with either pulsatile (PP) or non-pulsatile (NP) perfusion performed by MEDOS DeltaStream centrifugal diagonal pump. Hemodynamic properties of blood flow were described in terms of Energy Equivalent Pressure (EEP) and Surplus Hemodynamic Energy (SHE). Systemic (SVRi) and pulmonary (PVRi) vascular resistance indices were monitored during operation and 18 h of postoperative period. Biomarkers of acute lung injury (ALI)-plasma Clara cell 16 protein (CC16), surfactant protein D (SP-D) and Elastase; acute liver/intestinal injury-plasma liver (L-FABP) and intestinal (I-FABP) fatty acid binding proteins; acute kidney injury (AKI)-urinary N-acetyl-β-D-glucosaminidase (NAG), kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1) and neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL), plasma ET-1 and erythrocyte E-NOS activity were assessed before surgery (T0), at sternum closure (T1), 2 h (T2) and 18 h (T3) of ICU-stay together with plasma lactates, free hemoglobin and perioperative creatinine clearance (CCr). Results: PP was characterized by a significantly higher SHE transferred to the patients (p < 0.001), lower perioperative SVRi (p < 0.05), PVRi (p < 0.05) and lactates (p < 0.05). The SHE during PP showed direct and significant correlation with E-NOS activity (R = 0.53) and free hemoglobin (R = 0.58), p < 0.01; while the inverse correlation was found with ET-1 levels at T1 (R = - 0.44) and at T2 (R = - 0.45), p = 0.03. Plasma lactates during first postoperative hours correlated mostly with PVRi but not with SVRi, p < 0.001. Mean SVRi calculated during NP paradoxically showed direct correlation with E-NOS activity (R = 0.47, p < 0.01) and inverse correlation with ET-1 levels (R = - 0.54, p < 0.01) detected at sternum closure. ALI markers, L-FABP and I-FABP did not show significant differences between groups, although PVRi at T1 correlated positively with CC16 at T1 (R = 0.42, p = 0.02) and with Elastase at T1 (R = 0.39, p = 0.03). No difference was found between pre- and post-operative CCr in the PP-group (71 ± 23 vs 60 ± 35 mL/min, p = 0.27), while it decreased significantly in the NP-group (67 ± 24 vs 45 ± 15 mL/min, p < 0.001). The PPgroup showed significantly lowed urinary levels of NAG at T3 (p = 0.008), and NGAL at T1 (p = 0.01), T2 (p = 0.001) and T3 (p = 0.03) postoperatively. Conclusions: PP produced by MEDOS DeltaStream DP3 centrifugal pump resulted in hemodynamic advantages and signs of better tissue perfusion when compared with NP. PP showed higher safety for renal physiology, resulting in better maintenance of glomerular filtration and lower renal tissue injury. Progressive systemic and pulmonary vasoconstriction observed during NP is supposed to depend mostly on the excessive sympathetic activation while endothelial-derived factors could serve to counterbalance this effect.

N2  - Objectives: Mechanical circulatory support (MCS) is a rescue therapy for infants and children suffering from severe cardiorespiratory failure with specific system-related complications like bleeding, thromboembolism and device failure. Novel circuit components for temporary MCS with improved haemodynamic properties may improve patients' outcome and reduce system-related morbidities. The Deltastream® DP3 (Medos Medizintechnik AG, Stolberg, Germany) is a newly designed rotational pump with a diagonally streamed impeller that can be used in children of all ages (priming volume 16 ml, flow 0-8 l/min). The aim of this study was to analyse the feasibility and safety of the DP3 pump system in children. Methods: We retrospectively investigated a consecutive series of 16 children [median age 0.9 months (0.1-55 months), median weight 3.2 kg (2.5-14 kg)]. The DP3 circuit was used 22 times in these children for different indications: (I) extracorporeal life support (ECLS) in post-cardiotomy heart failure (n = 11), (II) ECLS in cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) (n = 7) and (III) extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (n = 4). Results: Median duration of MCS was 4 days (0-18 days), 12 patients (75%) were weaned successfully from MCS, 4 of these children (25%) died after weaning, with a median survival time of 15 days (6-28 days). Overall survival rate was 50% and all 8 survivors were discharged home without neurological injury. There was no case of severe bleeding, thromboembolic complications or device failure. Mean lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) before MCS was 700 (±384) U/l, and increased to a maximum of 2279 (±2635) U/l during MCS (P = 0.04). Baseline D-dimer values were 3.4 (±3.0) mg/l and rose significantly to 19.5 (±11.5) mg/l during MCS (P < 0.001). The mean of the highest plasma-free haemoglobin during MCS was 21.0 (±42.9) mg/dl. The increase in plasma-free haemoglobin correlated moderately with the duration of MCS (Pearson's r: 0.78). Conclusion: The use of the Deltastream® DP3 seems to be safe and effective for MCS in children and may show a low degree of haemolysis. We observed no system-related complications and an overall good outcome in this demanding patient cohort. © The Author 2013.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: Based on continuous technical innovations and recent research, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has become a promising tool in the treatment of patients with acute (cardio)pulmonary failure. Nevertheless, any extracorporeal technique requires a high degree of experience and knowledge, so that a restriction to specialized centres seems to be reasonable. As a consequence of this demand, the need for inter-hospital transfer of patients with severely impaired (cardio)pulmonary function is rising. Unfortunately, most of the ECMO devices used in the clinical setting are not suitable for inter-hospital transport because of their size, weight or complexity. In this article, we describe our first experiences with the airborne transport of 6 patients on a new portable, miniaturized and lightweight extracorporeal circulation system, the Medos deltastream® DP3. METHODS: Six patients suffering acute respiratory failure were taken on venovenous ECMO (DP3) out-of-centre and transferred to the University Medical Center Regensburg by helicopter. All cardiorespiratory-relevant parameters of the patients and the technical functioning of the device were continuously monitored and documented. RESULTS: Implantation of the device and air-supported transport were performed without any technical complications. The patients were transported from a distance of 66-178 km, requiring a time of 40-120 min. With the help of the new deltastream® DP3 ECMO device, a prompt stabilization of the cardiopulmonary function could be achieved in all patients. One patient was under ongoing cardiopulmonary resuscitation by the time our ECMO team arrived at the peripheral hospital and died shortly after arrival in the central emergency ward. CONCLUSIONS: Our experience shows that the deltastream® DP3 is an absolutely reliable and safe ECMO device that could gain growing importance in the field of airborne transportation of patients on ECMO due to its unsophisticated, miniaturized and lightweight characteristics.

N2  - A novel pulsatile rotary flow pump has been used in clinical extracorporeal life support (ECLS) in Europe. The objective of this study is to evaluate the Medos Deltastream DP3 diagonal pump (Medos Medizintechnik AG, Stolberg, Germany) in a simulated pediatric ECLS system. The ECLS circuit consisted of a Medos Hilite 800LT hollow fiber membrane oxygenator (Medos Medizintechnik AG), a Medos Deltastream DP3 diagonal pump, a 10Fr Terumo TenderFlow Pediatric Arterial Cannula (Terumo Corporation, Tokyo, Japan), and an arterial/venous tubing. All trials were conducted at flow rates ranging from 200-800mL/min (in 200mL/min increments) under a blood temperature of 35°C using human blood (hematocrit 40%). The postcannula pressure was maintained 60mmHg by a Hoffman clamp. Real-time pressure and flow data were recorded using a Labview-based acquisition system (National Instruments, Austin, TX, USA). The results showed that the Medos Deltastream DP3 can generate effective pulsatile flow without backflow, provide higher flow rates and pressures than nonpulsatile flow, and then create surplus hemodynamic energy and more total hemodynamic energy than nonpulsatile flow. Pulsatility increased with increased speed differential values and flow rates, while the oxygenator pressure drop increased at an acceptable level. The Medos Deltastream DP3 diagonal pump can provide adequate quality of pulsatility without backflow, and generate more hemodynamic energy under pulsatile mode in a simulated pediatric ECLS system. © 2013, The Authors.

N2  - Objectives: A recent improvement of the extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) system led to the development of the Deltastream® (DP3) rotational blood pump with optional pulsatile perfusion. This pump reaches a high hydraulic power by optimal flow. In a bovine animal model we wanted to observe the performance characteristics of this pump and compare different types of venous cannulas. Methods: Veno-arterial peripheral bypass was established in three bovine experiments using the recently introduced DP3 blood pump. We measured the inlet pressure when we increased the flow and the pump speed by using a traditional rectilinear venous cannula (Medos®) and a self-expanding venous cannula (Smartcanula®). Results: The maximum flow of the Medos® cannula was 4.9 l/min at 8000 rpm; the venous line pressure was -85 mmHg at 8000 rpm, and the arterial line pressure was 260 mmHg at 8000 rpm. The maximum flow of the Smartcanula® was 5.7 l/min at 10 000 rpm; the venous line pressure was 36 mmHg at 9000 rpm, and the arterial line pressure was 331 mmHg at 9000 rpm. The DP3 pump achieves higher flow with the self-expanding cannula than with the rectilinear cannula while negative venous pressure of -36 mmHg can be kept. Meanwhile the rectilinear cannula required negative venous pressure up to -85 mmHg at maximal flow. The profile of the arterial line pressure is equally better for the Smartcanula®. Conclusions: We found improved fluid dynamics by using a self-expanding venous cannula in peripheral cannulation for the DP3 pump.

N2  - Background: Diagonal pumps for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in small patients combine the advantages of being small, requiring a low priming volume and causing only few hemolysis. DP3 (Medos, Germany) is a new diagonal pump allowing pulsatile perfusion that was shown to be beneficial. Methods: Between 7/2007 and 03/2012, we supported 53 ECMO patients aged from 1 day to 16.9 years (mean 3.1, median 0.3 years) using 14 Centrimag (Table Presented) (Cen), 28 Rotaflow (Rot), and 41 DP3 pump heads. Mean and range of pump run time were Cen: 181 (65-537), Rot: 193 (1-857), DP3: 221 (12-1404) hours. Kaplan-Meier evaluations considered freedom from isolated pump change (IPC), assuming simultaneous change including other components as not pump induced. We stratified by pump type, ECMO indication, and patient age group. Conclusions: According to our preliminary experience, we consider DP3 a competitive diagonal pump capable of pulsatile perfusion.

N2  - Introduction: Shunt thrombosis after correction of hypoplastic left heart syndrom leads to an acute hypoxemia and subsequently to a cardiac failure. Implantation of extracorporeal life support (ECLS) remains the only therapeutical option for circulatory arrest in this situation. Establishment of ECLS requires a re-sternotomy or a potentially harmful cannulation of carotid artery. We report the first succesful use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) with a new bi-caval dual lumen catheter for treating an acute cardiorespiratory failure due to shunt thrombosis in a patient after Norwood I procedure. Surgical Technique: Two-week-old newborn developed nine days following a Norwood I procedure with creation of a modified Blalock-Taussig-shunt a profound hypoxemia and hypotension. Emergency angiography showed a shunt thrombosis. Repeated balloon dilatation and local lysis were unsuccessful. During cardiopulmonary resuscitation, a new 13 Fr. bi-caval dual lumen catheter was implanted in the right jugular vein and ECMO was initiated. The ECMO system consisted of a diagonal pump DP3 (MEDOS Medizintechnik AG) and a newborn Hilte 800 LT ECMO Oxygenator (MEDOS Medizintechnik AG). A surgical shunt revision was performed after 50 hours of ECMO support. Surgical revision was done using solely ECMO. Postoperatively weaning from ECMO was successful. Discussion: Implantation of ECLS in cardio respiratory failure due to shunt thrombosis after correction of hypoplastic left heart syndrom necessitates a re-sternotomy with a conventional thoracic cannulation or a cannulation of carotid artery and jugular vein. Re-sternotomy with a conventional thoracic cannulation is time consuming and associated with an increased risk of bleeding and infection. In addition cannulation of carotid artery may lead to neurological damage. In contrast, implantation of a bi-caval dual lumen catheter in the jugular vein is a fast and safe procedure. We show that ECMO support is a feasible emergency therapeutical option for an acute cardio-respiratory failure due to shunt thrombosis after correction of hypoplastic left heart syndrome.

N2  - Objectives: New models of centrifugal pumps are claimed to have better hemodynamic performance in pulsatile perfusion during CPB. Few data are available for hemodynamic evaluation of these pumps in vivo, especially in highrisk groups as elderly patients. The study aims at comparing hemodynamic effects of pulsatile versus non-pulsatile perfusion using MEDOS DeltaStream- DP3 centrifugal pump in patients over 75 years old. Methods: Forty patients with severe aortic stenosis (mean age 80.7±3.3, mean EuroScore 5.8±1.4) undergoing AVR from 1.01.2010 to 31.01.2010 were prospectively randomized into pulsatile (n=20pts) and non-pulsatile groups (n=20pts). Pressure and flow curves were recorded simultaneously from external flow-meters (TransonicHT110) and pressure monitor at 6 time points during CPB (at pre-oxygenator, post-oxygenator, aortic cannula and patients radial artery levels). Pulsatility was quantified in terms of Energy Equivalent Pressure(EEP) and Surplus Hemodynamic Energy(SHE). Hemodynamic indexes and clinical effects were monitored during 24 hours peri-operatively. Results: Groups showed no difference in mean CPB time (p=0.98), cross-clamp time (p=0.95), mean perfusion flow (p=0.32) and pressure (p=0.16) values. In both groups the measured blood flow corresponded to the calculated one. Mean SHE generated at the outlet of the pump was 113.5±21.8 ergs/cm3 with further progressive drop along the circuit until 5.3+1.9 ergs/cm3 calculated in the patient (4.7% from initial level). The pulsatile group showed lower vascular resistance during CPB (p=0.035) and significant difference in SVR (p=0.04) and PVR (p=0.02) just after operation. Levels of SHE delivered to the patient correlated positively with urine output during CPB (R=0.34, p=0.041) and PVR after CPB (R=0.44, p=0.015). No differences between groups were found in pharmacologic support, transfusion rates, creatinine levels, respiratory indexes and intubation time. Longer ICU and hospital stay were related to severity of preoperative co-morbidities. Conclusions: Pulsatile flow produced by MEDOS DeltaStream-DP3 centrifugal pump results in hemodynamic advantages and better tissue perfusion in highrisk patients.

N2  - OBJECTIVE. Ongoing technological improvements enlarge the indication spectra for the use of extracorporal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). In case of severe cardiac failure the use as an extra corporal life support (ECLS) cannulated in veno-arterial manner is possible as well. In this case we report the worldwide first use of the novel Deltastream-DP3-System (Medos Corp.) in a patient suffering from acute right heart failure due to pulmonary embolism following cardiac surgery. MATERIALS AND METHODS. In a 68 year-old male patient 6 days after mitral valve reconstruction cardiac arrest occurred during physiotherapy treatment. After failure of restoring circulation, a short-term ECLS system (Lifebridge° implanted under cardiopulmonary resuscitation by inserting cannulas in venous and arterial femoral vessels and then switched immediately to the DP3-Deltastream system. CT-scan revealed the diagnosis of a massive central pulmonary embolism. Transesophageal echocardiography showed a dilated failing right ventricle. A thrombolytic therapy was carried out by administering 100 mg Alteplase. Following CT-scan showed reduced thrombus burden. The Deltastream system was carried out for 148 h. PTT was maintained to 1.5-fold under i.v. heparine therapy. Pump blood flow was held at a maximum of 4.5 l/min (7,000-8,000 r/min) for 2 days. Despite transesophageal echocardiography showing improved left ventrICUlar function the ECLS flow was maintained for further 2 days focussed on the improvement of right heart. Further on the pump flow was reduced every 6 h and the system could be explanted after 6 days in now stable cardiolpulmonary situation. The patient was discharged on day 65 at home in good state without any neurological dysfunction. RESULTS. Overall duration of the ECLS Deltastream therapy was 148 h. No system related major complication occurred during the time. Even in maximum blood flow of 4.5 l/min no relevant hemolysis was measured. LDH level was only slightly elevated to 250-300 U/l. CONCLUSIONS. In this patient the worldwide first use of the new Deltastream-System as an extra corporal life support (ECLS) led to a successful therapy of a patient suffering from an else fatal pulmonary embolism. Handling of the system in a cardiothoracic ICU seemed quite feasible in this case.

N2  - The DELTASTREAM blood pumps belong to a special type of rotary blood pumps, so called diagonal flow pumps. Diagonal flow pumps represent a mixture of axial and radial pumps. End of the nineties the development of the DELTASTREAM blood pumps was initiated at the Helmholtz institute Aachen. The intention was to design a pump of small size, which is however able to generate a high flow and a high pressure to fulfill the requirements of a wide range of applications within the clinical field. From simplified bypass systems for routine applications to ECLS and short term ventricular assist applications in pediatrics and adults. Besides that the pump system should be able to perform continuous as well as pulsatile flow. During development different impeller designs were tested to improve and optimize the hydraulic as well as hematologic characteristics. A shrouded design of the impeller with washout holes was the result to meet these multiple requirements. In 2001 the DP1 was introduced to the market. With its integrated motor and the approval for 24 hours of use the DP1 engaged a unique position at that time. To strengthen the position of the DELTASTREAM concept for routine applications (minimized bypass systems, beating heart support), the DP2 was developed. A new external motor drives the impeller by means of a magnetic coupling. The DP3 represents the main part in the next generation of DELTASTREAM blood pump technology. Especially by using a new bearing concept the performance for longer pump runs was optimized radically. In a first step the DP3 is actually approved and CE-marked for 7 days of use. Combined with the option to run the pump in continuous as well as pulsatile mode, the DELTASTREAM system meets the requirements on new perfusion concepts nowadays. Besides excellent hydraulic capabilities, the first clinical results showed low thrombogenity and also a very low hemolysis. Especially the small design and resulting low priming of the new pump qualifies the DP3 for neonatal and pediatric applications. Besides that the pump can be adjusted exactly at very low flows. Additional safety and control functions of the console lead to an outstanding position of the new DELTASTREAM perfusion system.N (Figure presented).

N2  - Purpose: The Medos (Stolberg, Germany) DP3 diagonal flow pump was designed to provide a cost-effective means of mechanical circulatory support up to 7 days duration combined with low priming volume (<30 ml), a wide range of flow rates (0-8 l/min), and low morbidity. The results of preclinical animal testing are presented. Methods: For device testing 12 sheep (body weight 70-80 kg) were selected. The pumps were used as right-heart bypass aiming at permanent flow rates >3 l/min. Small outflow cannulae facilitated high line pressures (>200 mmHg) mimicking systemic flow conditions. Using the lung as end-organ detection of peripheral thromboembolism was eased. Immediately after implantation the sheep were extubated and were allowed to move in a cage. Activated clotting time (ACT) aimed at 180-200s. Clinical data, pump parameters, and laboratory data were obtained regularly. After 7 days of testing pump hardware, heart and lungs were subjected to autopsy. Results: The testing was done in two series. In the initial series 3 of 6 pumps failed 0.5-15 hours after implantation because of thrombosis of the flushing canals of the rotor. After technical modifications including the flushing canals the second series of testing was done. Five of six animals had an uneventful clinical course over 7 days. Laboratory data did not suggest relevant or progressive hemolysis. In one animal a fabrication defect (askew bearing pin) of these prototypes caused pump failure after 6 days. Anticoagulation was mostly inadequate with low ACTs. Very tiny thrombus formation on the rotor or the bearing pin was found in all survivors not altering function. One animal revealed a minimal (2mm) pulmonary thrombus. Conclusions: Prototype animal testing of the Medos Deltastream DP3 revealed reliable function and low morbidity over 7 days of implantation. Industrial fabrication is planned.

N2  - Background: Over the past 6 years at Penn State Hershey we have established a multi-disciplinary research team with the goal to improve the outcomes for children undergoing cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass and mechanical circulatory support. The Penn State Hershey Pediatric Cardiovascular Research Center has been established with the collaboration of teams from multiple academic departments and representing multiple disciplines. This center combines basic science, engineering, and clinical applications under the unified mission of pediatric cardiovascular research. Scientists and clinicians in the center represent the departments of Pediatrics, Surgery, Bioengineering, Anesthesiology, Comparative Medicine, Public Health Sciences, Pharmacology, Obstetrics & Gynecology, and Nursing Education & Professional Development. Objective: Our major objective is the development of novel technologies and methodologies to be used in minimizing the adverse effects of cardiovascular operations and cardiopulmonary bypass in neonates, infants, and children. Particular attention will be focused on reducing the associated morbidities of cerebral, myocardial, pulmonary, and renal injury. Our long term aspirations are to: 1) establish The Penn State Hershey Pediatric Cardiovascular Research Center as a leading center for further development of novel treatments and cutting edge devices for cardiovascular health in pediatric populations, both at the Penn State Hershey Children's Hospital and at other pediatric heart centers around the world; 2) educate more bioengineers, medical students, residents, post-doctoral fellows and junior faculty members in pediatric cardiovascular research; and 3) ensure that our international conference continues to be the leading conference for defining the problems of current mechanical circulatory support systems in pediatric patients and suggesting appropriate solutions for these pediatric cardiac patients. Current Projects: Impact of Pulsatile CPB on Vital Organ Recovery (Clinical/Basic Science/Engineering).

Summary: The Penn State Hershey College of Medicine, Department of Pediatrics contributed over $600,000 in funds to support the creation of the new pediatric cardiac research center. Many research components in the center (e.g., heart-lung machines, heater and cooler units, advanced ultrasound devices) are identical to the clinical instruments used in our pediatric cardiac operating room. In addition, we are testing several new heart pumps and oxygenators for future clinical studies in pediatric patients in the United States and around the globe. Within the past 6 years, our pediatric cardiac research group has generated over 122 articles, over 160 national and international presentations and invited lectures, as well as over $7.7 million in grants. Additionally, we have trained dozens of medical students, post-doctoral fellows, and undergraduate and graduate biomedical engineering students. With the creation of the Penn State Hershey Pediatric Cardiovascular Research Center, we strive to become one of the leading centers for the innovation and development of novel devices and treatments for congenital heart surgery. We also seek to educate more bioengineers, medical students, residents, post-doctoral fellows, and junior faculty members in pediatric cardiovascular research. Finally, we seek to continue the growth of our conference (The International Conference on Pediatric Mechanical Circulatory Support Systems and Pediatric Cardiopulmonary Perfusion - http://www.hmc.psu.edu/childrens/pedscpb/) in order to provide a scientific venue for the pioneering research being performed in pediatric mechanical circulatory support and cardiopulmonary perfusion.
