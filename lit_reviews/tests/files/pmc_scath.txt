TI  - AlphaFold2 reveals commonalities and novelties in protein structure space for 21 
      model organisms.
LID - 160
AB  - Deep-learning (DL) methods like DeepMind’s AlphaFold2 (AF2) have led to
      substantial improvements in protein structure prediction. We analyse confident
      AF2 models from 21 model organisms using a new classification protocol
      (CATH-Assign) which exploits novel DL methods for structural comparison and
      classification. Of ~370,000 confident models, 92% can be assigned to 3253
      superfamilies in our CATH domain superfamily classification. The remaining
      cluster into 2367 putative novel superfamilies. Detailed manual analysis on 618
      of these, having at least one human relative, reveal extremely remote homologies 
      and further unusual features. Only 25 novel superfamilies could be confirmed.
      Although most models map to existing superfamilies, AF2 domains expand CATH by
      67% and increases the number of unique ‘global’ folds by 36% and will provide
      valuable insights on structure function relationships. CATH-Assign will harness
      the huge expansion in structural data provided by DeepMind to rationalise
      evolutionary changes driving functional divergence.

TI  - Contrastive learning on protein embeddings enlightens midnight zone.
LID - lqac043
AB  - Experimental structures are leveraged through multiple sequence alignments, or
      more generally through homology-based inference (HBI), facilitating the transfer 
      of information from a protein with known annotation to a query without any
      annotation. A recent alternative expands the concept of HBI from
      sequence-distance lookup to embedding-based annotation transfer (EAT). These
      embeddings are derived from protein Language Models (pLMs). Here, we introduce
      using single protein representations from pLMs for contrastive learning. This
      learning procedure creates a new set of embeddings that optimizes constraints
      captured by hierarchical classifications of protein 3D structures defined by the 
      CATH resource. The approach, dubbed ProtTucker, has an improved ability to
      recognize distant homologous relationships than more traditional techniques such 
      as threading or fold recognition. Thus, these embeddings have allowed sequence
      comparison to step into the ‘midnight zone’ of protein similarity, i.e. the
      region in which distantly related sequences have a seemingly random pairwise
      sequence similarity. The novelty of this work is in the particular combination of
      tools and sampling techniques that ascertained good performance comparable or
      better to existing state-of-the-art sequence comparison methods. Additionally,
      since this method does not need to generate alignments it is also orders of
      magnitudes faster. The code is available at https://github.com/Rostlab/EAT.

TI  - Molecular Cloning, Expression Analyses, and Physiological Roles of Cathelicidins 
      in the Bursa of Fabricius of the Japanese Quail, Coturnix japonica.
LID - 1341
AB  - Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) act directly on pathogens and maintain the
      anti-inflammatory effects and activation of immunocompetent cells. Therefore, the
      activation of the immune system in poultry via the elevation of endogenous AMPs
      has been attempted. In this study, we focused on the host defense mechanisms in
      the bursa of Fabricius (BF) of Japanese quail, cloned the cDNA of cathelicidin
      (CATH)-1 to -3, and analyzed their expression sites. In situ hybridization
      experiments revealed the mRNA expression of the CATHs in the interfollicular
      epithelium surrounding the lumen of the quail BF, which suggests that each CATH
      may exert its antimicrobial action directly in the BF. The intravenous injection 
      of bacterial lipoteichoic acid and lipopolysaccharide endotoxins into the quail
      promoted the mRNA expression of CATH-1 and CATH-3 in the BF. The addition of
      CATH-1 or CATH-2 at the time of the antigen injection into mice resulted in
      antiserum with high antibody titers. Ad libitum administration of butyrate, a
      short-chain fatty acid, in the drinking water induced an increase in CATH-2 mRNA 
      expression in the BF under certain conditions. These results may improve the
      defense mechanisms of quail by stimulating CATH expression in the BF through
      their diet.

TI  - Cathepsin B Relocalization in Late Membrane Disrupted Neurons Following Diffuse
      Brain Injury in Rats.
LID - 17590914221099112
AB  - Traumatic brain injury (TBI) has consequences that last for years following
      injury. While TBI can precipitate a variety of diffuse pathologies, the
      mechanisms involved in injury-induced neuronal membrane disruption remain
      elusive. The lysosomal cysteine protease, Cathepsin B (Cath B), and specifically 
      its redistribution into the cytosol has been implicated in cell death. Little is 
      known about Cath B or neuronal membrane disruption chronically following diffuse 
      TBI. Therefore, the current study evaluated Cath B and diffuse neuronal membrane 
      disruption over a more chronic post-injury window (6 h–4 w). We evaluated Cath B 
      in adult male Sprague-Dawley rats following central fluid percussion injury
      (CFPI). Expression of Cath B, as well as Cath B-associated pro (Bak and AIF) and 
      anti-apoptotic (Bcl-xl) proteins, were assessed using western blot analysis. Cath
      B activity was also assessed. Localization of Cath B was evaluated in the
      membrane disrupted and non-disrupted population following CFPI using
      immunohistochemistry paired with quantitative image analysis and ultrastructural 
      verification. There was no difference in expression or activity of Cath B or any 
      of the associated proteins between sham and CFPI at any time post-injury.
      Immunohistological studies, however, showed a sub-cellular re-localization of
      Cath B at 2 w and 4 w post-injury in the membrane disrupted neuronal population
      as compared to the time-point matched non-disrupted neurons. Both membrane
      disruption and Cath B relocalization appear linked to neuronal atrophy. These
      observations are indicative of a late secondary pathology that represents an
      opportunity for therapeutic treatment of these neurons following diffuse TBI.
      Summary Statement Lysosomal cathepsin B relocalizes to the cytosol in neurons
      with disrupted plasmalemmal membranes weeks following diffuse brain injury. Both 
      the membrane disrupted and cathepsin B relocalized neuronal subpopulations
      displayed smaller soma and nucleus size compared to non-pathological neurons,
      indicating atrophy.

TI  - Sensor-Based Nerve Compression Measurement: A Scoping Review of Current Concepts 
      and a Preclinical Evaluation of Commercial Microsensors.
LID - 868396
AB  - Background: Chronic nerve compression is the most common indication for nerve
      surgery. However, the clinical diagnosis still relies on surrogate parameters
      since devices for direct nerve compression pressure measurement (DNCPM) are
      clinically unavailable yet.Objectives: To review previous approaches to DNCPM and
      evaluate presently available microsensor systems for their feasibility and
      reliability in preclinical nerve compression models.Methods: A scoping literature
      review was conducted in accordance with the PRISMA-ScR guidelines. A subsequent
      market research aimed at identifying commercially available sensor systems
      potentially suitable for DNCPM. Sensors were evaluated for feasibility and safety
      of perineural sensor positioning, tissue compatibility and measurement
      reliability in a synthetic nerve compression model and an ex-vivo chicken leg
      model.Results: A scoping literature review identified 197 potentially eligible
      studies of which 65 were included in the analysis. Previous approaches to DNCPM
      predominantly used pressure sensing catheters designed for fluid- or
      intra-compartmental pressure measurement. A market research identified two
      piezoresistive sensor systems (IntraSense, SMi, United States; Mikro-Cath,
      Millar, United States) as potentially suitable for intraoperative DNCPM. In both 
      preclinical models, the detected compression pressure differed significantly
      between sensors and systems showed substantial measurement variability with a
      median percent coefficient of variation between 15.5% and 32%. Sensor position
      was accountable for up to 99.1% of the variance.Conclusion: Measurement
      variability caused by unreliable sensor positioning is a key limitation of
      presently available sensors when applied for nerve compression measurements.
      Redesigned systems with small, flat-shaped and longitudinally oriented sensors
      and dedicated introducers would facilitate sensor positioning and therefore may
      allow for reliable measurements.

TI  - Renaissance of Cardiac Imaging to Assist Percutaneous Interventions in Congenital
      Heart Diseases:The Role of Three-Dimensional Echocardiography and Multimodality
      Imaging.
LID - 894472
AB  - Percutaneous interventions have completely refashioned the management of children
      with congenital heart diseases (CHD) and the use of non-invasive imaging has
      become the gold standard to plan and guide these procedures in the modern era. We
      are now facing a dual challenge to improve the standard of care in low-risk
      patients, and to shift our strategies from the classic open chest surgery to
      imaging-guided percutaneous interventions in high-risk patients. Such rapid
      evolution of ultrasound technologies over the last 20 years have permitted the
      integration of transthoracic, transesophageal and intracardiac echocardiography
      into the interventional workflow to improve image guidance and reduce radiation
      burden from fluoroscopy and angiography. Specifically, miniaturization of
      transesophageal probe and advances in three-dimensional (3D) imaging techniques
      have enabled real-time 3D image guidance during complex interventional procedure,
      In addition, multimodality and fusion imaging techniques harness the strengths of
      different modalities to enhance understanding of anatomical and spatial
      relationship between different structures, improving communication and
      coordination between interventionalists and imaging specialists. In this review, 
      we aim to provide an overview of 3D imaging modalities and multimodal fusion in
      procedural planning and live guidance of percutaneous interventions. At the
      present times, 3D imaging can no longer be considered a luxury but a routine
      clinical tool to improve procedural success and patient outcomes.

TI  - Cathepsin B p.Gly284Val Variant in Parkinson’s Disease Pathogenesis.
LID - 7086
AB  - Parkinson’s disease (PD) is generally considered a sporadic disorder, but a
      strong genetic background is often found. The aim of this study was to identify
      the underlying genetic cause of PD in two affected siblings and to subsequently
      assess the role of mutations in Cathepsin B (CTSB) in susceptibility to PD. A
      typical PD family was identified and whole-exome sequencing was performed in two 
      affected siblings. Variants of interest were validated using Sanger sequencing.
      CTSB p.Gly284Val was genotyped in 2077 PD patients and 615 unrelated healthy
      controls from the Czech Republic, Ireland, Poland, Ukraine, and the USA. The gene
      burden analysis was conducted for the CTSB gene in an additional 769 PD probands 
      from Mayo Clinic Florida familial PD cohort. CTSB expression and activity in
      patient-derived fibroblasts and controls were evaluated by qRT-PCR, western blot,
      immunocytochemistry, and enzymatic assay. The CTSB p.Gly284Val candidate variant 
      was only identified in affected family members. Functional analysis of CTSB
      patient-derived fibroblasts under basal conditions did not reveal overt changes
      in endogenous expression, subcellular localization, or enzymatic activity in the 
      heterozygous carrier of the CTSB variant. The identification of the CTSB
      p.Gly284Val may support the hypothesis that the CTSB locus harbors variants with 
      differing penetrance that can determine the disease risk.

TI  - Imaging Modality to Guide Left Atrial Appendage Closure: Current Status and
      Future Perspectives.
LID - 3756
AB  - Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common cardiac arrhythmia in adults. The
      left atrial appendage (LAA) is the most likely source of thrombus formation in
      patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF). Left atrial appendage
      closure (LAAC) represents an effective alternative to NOAC in patients with NVAF.
      Expert consensus documents recommend intraprocedural imaging by means of either
      transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) or intracardiac echocardiography (ICE) in 
      addition to standard fluoroscopy to guide LAAC. TEE-guided LAAC usually requires 
      general anesthesia. The ICE technique is a “minimalist approach”, without general
      anesthesia, but ICE imaging techniques are not yet simplified and standardize,
      and the ICE may result in inferior image quality compared with that of TEE.
      Another “minimalist approach” can be the use of ICE via the esophageal route
      (ICE-TEE), that jet is validated to identify the presence of LAA thrombi in
      patients and to perform other procedures. In our cath laboratory ICE-TEE to guide
      LAAC is used in some complex patients. Indeed, our single center experience
      suggests that ICE-TEE could be a good alternative imaging technique to guide LAAC
      procedure without general anesthesia.

TI  - Increased core body temperature exacerbates defective protein prenylation in
      mouse models of mevalonate kinase deficiency.
LID - e160929
AB  - Mevalonate kinase deficiency (MKD) is characterized by recurrent fevers and
      flares of systemic inflammation, caused by biallelic loss-of-function mutations
      in MVK. The underlying disease mechanisms and triggers of inflammatory flares are
      poorly understood because of the lack of in vivo models. We describe genetically 
      modified mice bearing the hypomorphic mutation p.Val377Ile (the commonest variant
      in patients with MKD) and amorphic, frameshift mutations in Mvk. Compound
      heterozygous mice recapitulated the characteristic biochemical phenotype of MKD, 
      with increased plasma mevalonic acid and clear buildup of unprenylated GTPases in
      PBMCs, splenocytes, and bone marrow. The inflammatory response to LPS was
      enhanced in compound heterozygous mice and treatment with the NLRP3 inflammasome 
      inhibitor MCC950 prevented the elevation of circulating IL-1β, thus identifying a
      potential inflammasome target for future therapeutic approaches. Furthermore,
      lines of mice with a range of deficiencies in mevalonate kinase and abnormal
      prenylation mirrored the genotype-phenotype relationship in human MKD.
      Importantly, these mice allowed the determination of a threshold level of
      residual enzyme activity, below which protein prenylation is impaired. Elevated
      temperature dramatically but reversibly exacerbated the deficit in the mevalonate
      pathway and the defective prenylation in vitro and in vivo, highlighting
      increased body temperature as a likely trigger of inflammatory flares.

TI  - ‘Just the two of us’: single-operator interventional left atrial appendage
      closure—a case report.
LID - ytad078
AB  - Background: Different procedural strategies have been published targeting to
      facilitate transcatheter left atrial appendage closure (LAAc). We demonstrate
      feasibility of a procedural set-up allowing single-operator LAAc in a selected
      patient. Case summary: A 87-year-old male with persistent Afib (CHA2DS2VASc,
      five; HASBLED, three) was referred to our hospital for LAAc. Pre-procedural
      planning and device sizing with three-dimensional transesophageal
      echocardiography (3DTEE) confirmed a non-complex anatomy of the essential
      anatomical structures predicting suitability for LAAc. Therefore, the procedure
      was performed with a simplified single-operator interventional approach.
      Intraprocedural TEE guidance, device preparation, and LAAc were accomplished by
      the interventionalist himself. For procedural guidance, the TEE probe was
      arranged and handled in a technique comparable to the use of intracardiac
      echocardiography (ICE). Procedure time (skin-to-skin) was 21 min, left atrial
      access time 9 min, and fluoroscopy time was 4:28 min without the use of contrast 
      dye. The patient was discharged the following day in good medical conditions.
      Discussion: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on successful 
      single-operator LAAc in a selected patient. The intervention, pre-procedural
      screening, and intraprocedural 3D TEE were performed by one single experienced
      interventionalist. This simplified technique is based on a standardized
      pre-procedural imaging-protocol with 3D echocardiography. According to our
      experience, this streamlined approach is a valuable option in non-complex LAAc
      cases. In the growing field of structural cardiac interventions, this approach
      might be an interesting option for centres with limited personal and technical
      resources.

TI  - Esophageal Protection and Temperature Monitoring Using the Circa S-Cath™
      Temperature Probe during Epicardial Radiofrequency Ablation of the Pulmonary
      Veins and Posterior Left Atrium.
LID - 6939
AB  - Although epicardial bipolar radiofrequency ablation should diminish the risk of
      esophageal thermal injury in comparison to an endocardial ablation, cases of
      lethal atrio-esophageal fistula have been reported. To better understand this
      risk and to reduce the possibility of a thermal injury, we monitored the
      esophageal temperature with the Circa S-Cath™ temperature probe during and
      immediately after the ablation while implementing three procedural safety
      measures. Twenty patients (15 males; 63 ± 10 years) were prospectively enrolled
      (November 2019–February 2021). All patients underwent an epicardial ablation
      procedure, including an antral left and right pulmonary vein isolation with
      bidirectional bipolar clamping, and a roof and inferior line using unidirectional
      bipolar radiofrequency. Three procedural preventive mitigations were implemented:
      (1) transesophageal echocardiographic visualization of the atrio-esophageal
      interface, with probe retraction before the energy delivery; (2) lifting the
      ablated tissue away from the esophagus during an energy application; and (3) a 30
      s cool-off and irrigation period after the energy delivery. The esophageal
      temperature was recorded using an insulated multisensory intraluminal esophageal 
      temperature probe (Circa S-Cath™). Of the 20 patients enrolled, 7 patients had
      paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AF), 8 persistent AF and 5 longstanding
      persistent AF. The average maximum luminal esophageal temperature observed was
      36.2 ± 0.7 °C (34.8–38.2 °C). In our clinical experience, no abrupt increase in
      the luminal esophageal temperature above the baseline was observed. Since no
      measurements exceeded the threshold of 39 °C, no prompt interruption of energy
      delivery was required. Intraluminal esophageal temperature monitoring is feasible
      and can be helpful in confirming correct catheter position and safe energy
      application in bipolar epicardial left atrial ablation. Intra-procedural
      preventive mitigations should be implemented to reduce the risk of esophageal
      temperature rises.

TI  - Activity in a prefrontal-periaqueductal gray circuit overcomes behavioral and
      endocrine features of the passive coping stress response.
LID - e2210783119
AB  - The question of how the brain links behavioral and biological features of
      defensive stress responses has remained elusive. Here, we show that active
      stress-coping behavior in rats is associated with activity increases along a
      caudal medial prefrontal cortex–midbrain periaqueductal gray circuit. Optogenetic
      manipulations of this pathway bidirectionally modulated active coping behavior.
      However, under more aversive conditions that provoked behavioral passivity and
      exaggerated stress-hormone responses, excitation of this same pathway
      significantly reduced each of these response features. These results highlight a 
      neural circuit that may redirect multiple aspects of the organism’s defensive
      repertoire away from passive coping and may be of importance for understanding
      how activated neural systems promote stress resilience.

TI  - How to Perform a Completely Fluoroless Ablation.
PG  - 5455-64
AB  - Radiation exposure related to electrophysiology catheter ablation procedures
      carries small but non-negligible stochastic and deterministic effects on health. 
      Lead aprons can also place considerable pressure on the spinal column, resulting 
      in potentially detrimental consequences. Fortunately, however, advancements in
      tools used for arrhythmia mapping and ablation have made it feasible to reduce or
      essentially eliminate the need for fluoroscopy, with no impact on the efficacy or
      safety of such procedures, as demonstrated by several long-term outcome studies. 
      In this review, we describe our stepwise approach to safely and efficiently
      perform a completely fluoroless ablation.

TI  - Identification of resistance gene analogs of the NBS-LRR family through
      transcriptome probing and in silico prediction of the expressome of Dalbergia
      sissoo under dieback disease stress.
LID - 1036029
AB  - Dalbergia sissoo is an important timber tree, and dieback disease poses a dire
      threat to it toward extinction. The genomic record of D. sissoo is not available 
      yet on any database; that is why it is challenging to probe the genetic elements 
      involved in stress resistance. Hence, we attempted to unlock the genetics
      involved in dieback resistance through probing the NBS-LRR family, linked with
      mostly disease resistance in plants. We analyzed the transcriptome of D. sissoo
      under dieback challenge through DOP-rtPCR analysis using degenerate primers from 
      conserved regions of NBS domain-encoded gene sequences. The differentially
      expressed gene sequences were sequenced and in silico characterized for
      predicting the expressome that contributes resistance to D. sissoo against
      dieback. The molecular and bioinformatic analyses predicted the presence of
      motifs including ATP/GTP-binding site motif A (P-loop NTPase domain), GLPL
      domain, casein kinase II phosphorylation site, and N-myristoylation site that are
      the attributes of proteins encoded by disease resistance genes. The
      physicochemical characteristics of identified resistance gene analogs,
      subcellular localization, predicted protein fingerprints, in silico functional
      annotation, and predicted protein structure proved their role in disease and
      stress resistance.

PG  - 238-50
AB  - The process of designing biomolecules, in particular proteins, is witnessing a
      rapid change in available tooling and approaches, moving from design through
      physicochemical force fields, to producing plausible, complex sequences fast via 
      end-to-end differentiable statistical models. To achieve conditional and
      controllable protein design, researchers at the interface of artificial
      intelligence and biology leverage advances in natural language processing (NLP)
      and computer vision techniques, coupled with advances in computing hardware to
      learn patterns from growing biological databases, curated annotations thereof, or
      both. Once learned, these patterns can be used to provide novel insights into
      mechanistic biology and the design of biomolecules. However, navigating and
      understanding the practical applications for the many recent protein design tools
      is complex. To facilitate this, we 1) document recent advances in deep learning
      (DL) assisted protein design from the last three years, 2) present a practical
      pipeline that allows to go from de novo-generated sequences to their predicted
      properties and web-powered visualization within minutes, and 3) leverage it to
      suggest a generated protein sequence which might be used to engineer a
      biosynthetic gene cluster to produce a molecular glue-like compound. Lastly, we
      discuss challenges and highlight opportunities for the protein design field.

      1H‐Detected Solid‐State NMR Spectroscopy.
LID - e202202616
AB  - Solid‐state NMR (ssNMR) spectroscopy facilitates the non‐destructive
      characterization of structurally heterogeneous biomolecules in their native
      setting, for example, comprising proteins, lipids and polysaccharides. Here we
      demonstrate the utility of high and ultra‐high field 1H‐detected fast MAS ssNMR
      spectroscopy, which exhibits increased sensitivity and spectral resolution, to
      further elucidate the atomic‐level composition and structural arrangement of the 
      cell wall of Schizophyllum commune, a mushroom‐forming fungus from the
      Basidiomycota phylum. These advancements allowed us to reveal that Cu(II) ions
      and the antifungal peptide Cathelicidin‐2 mainly bind to cell wall proteins at
      low concentrations while glucans are targeted at high metal ion concentrations.
      In addition, our data suggest the presence of polysaccharides containing N‐acetyl
      galactosamine (GalNAc) and proteins, including the hydrophobin proteins SC3,
      shedding more light on the molecular make‐up of cells wall as well as the
      positioning of the polypeptide layer. Obtaining such information may be of
      critical relevance for future research into fungi in material science and
      biomedical contexts.

TI  - Spatiotemporal patterns of gliosis and neuroinflammation in presenilin 1/2
      conditional double knockout mice.
LID - 966153
AB  - Increasing evidence indicates that neuroinflammation contributes to and
      exacerbates the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Neuroinflammation is
      thought to be primarily driven by glial cells (microglia and astrocytes) and
      escalates with neurodegenerative progression in AD. However, the spatiotemporal
      change patterns of glial reactivity and neuroinflammatory response during
      different stages of neurodegeneration, especially early in disease, remain
      unknown. Here we found that gliosis and the up-regulation of substantial
      neuroinflammatory genes were primarily initiated in the cortex of presenilin 1/2 
      conditional double knockout (cDKO) mice, rather than in the hippocampus.
      Specifically, astrocyte activation preceding microglial activation was found in
      the somatosensory cortex (SS) of cDKO mice at 6 weeks of age. Over time, both
      astrocyte and microglial activation were found in the whole cortex, and
      age-related increases in gliosis activation were more pronounced in the cortex
      compared to hippocampus. Moreover, the age-associated increase in glial
      activation was accompanied by a gradual increase in the expression of cell
      chemokines Ccl3 and Ccl4, complement related factors C1qb, C3 and C4, and
      lysosomal proteases cathepsin S and Z. These findings suggest that astrocyte and 
      microglial activation with a concurrent increase in inflammatory mediators such
      as chemokines might be an early event and contribute to the pathogenesis of
      neurodegeneration due to presenilin deficiency.

TI  - Catalase-deficient mice induce aging faster through lysosomal dysfunction.
LID - 192
AB  - Background: Lysosomes are a central hub for cellular metabolism and are involved 
      in the regulation of cell homeostasis through the degradation or recycling of
      unwanted or dysfunctional organelles through the autophagy pathway. Catalase, a
      peroxisomal enzyme, plays an important role in cellular antioxidant defense by
      decomposing hydrogen peroxide into water and oxygen. In accordance with
      pleiotropic significance, both impaired lysosomes and catalase have been linked
      to many age-related pathologies with a decline in lifespan. Aging is
      characterized by progressive accumulation of macromolecular damage and the
      production of high levels of reactive oxygen species. Although lysosomes degrade 
      the most long-lived proteins and organelles via the autophagic pathway, the role 
      of lysosomes and their effect on catalase during aging is not known. The present 
      study investigated the role of catalase and lysosomal function in
      catalase-knockout (KO) mice. Methods: We performed experiments on WT and catalase
      KO younger (9 weeks) and mature adult (53 weeks) male mice and Mouse embryonic
      fibroblasts isolated from WT and KO mice from E13.5 embryos as in vivo and in
      ex-vivo respectively. Mouse phenotyping studies were performed with controls, and
      a minimum of two independent experiments were performed with more than five mice 
      in each group. Results: We found that at the age of 53 weeks (mature adult),
      catalase-KO mice exhibited an aging phenotype faster than wild-type (WT) mice. We
      also found that mature adult catalase-KO mice induced leaky lysosome by
      progressive accumulation of lysosomal content, such as cathespin D, into the
      cytosol. Leaky lysosomes inhibited autophagosome formation and triggered impaired
      autophagy. The dysregulation of autophagy triggered mTORC1 (mechanistic target of
      rapamycin complex 1) activation. However, the antioxidant N-acetyl-L-cysteine and
      mTORC1 inhibitor rapamycin rescued leaky lysosomes and aging phenotypes in
      catalase-deficient mature adult mice. Conclusions: This study unveils the new
      role of catalase and its role in lysosomal function during aging.Video abstract

      perfusion: Results from the Collaborative Pilot Study to Determine the
      Correlation Between Intraoperative Observations Using Spy Near-Infrared Imaging
      and Cardiac Catheterization Laboratory Physiological Assessment of Lesion
      Severity.
PG  - 158-76
AB  - Objectives: Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) is performed using anatomic
      guidance. Data connecting the physiologic significance of the coronary vessel
      stenosis to the acute physiologic response to grafting are lacking. The
      Collaborative Pilot Study to Determine the Correlation Between Intraoperative
      Observations Using Spy Near-Infrared Imaging and Cardiac Catheterization
      Laboratory Physiological Assessment of Lesion Severity study is the first to
      compare preintervention coronary physiology with the acute regional myocardial
      perfusion change (RMP-QC) at CABG in a per-graft analysis. Methods: Non-emergent 
      patients undergoing diagnostic catheterization suitable for multivessel CABG were
      enrolled. Synergy between Percutaneous Coronary Intervention with Taxus score,
      fractional flow reserve (FFR), instantaneous wave free ratio (iFR), and
      quantitative coronary angiography was documented in 75 epicardial coronary
      arteries, with 62 angiographically intermediate and 13 severe stenoses. At CABG, 
      near-infrared fluorescence analysis quantified the relative change (post- vs
      pregrafting, termed RMP-QC) in the grafted vessel's perfusion territory. Scatter 
      plots were constructed for RMP-QC versus quantitative coronary angiography and
      RMP-QC versus FFR/iFR. Exact quadrant randomization test for randomness was used.
      Results: There was no relationship between RMP-QC and quantitative coronary
      angiography percent diameter stenosis, whether all study vessels were included
      (P = .949) or vessels with core-lab quantitative coronary angiography only
      (P = .922). A significant nonrandom association between RMP-QC and FFR
      (P = .025), as well as between RMP-QC and iFR (P = .008), was documented. These
      associations remained when excluding vessels with assigned FFR and iFR values
      (P = .0092 and P = .0006 for FFR and iFR, respectively). Conclusions: The
      Collaborative Pilot Study to Determine the Correlation Between Intraoperative
      Observations Using Spy Near-Infrared Imaging and Cardiac Catheterization
      Laboratory Physiological Assessment of Lesion Severity study demonstrates there
      is no association between angiographic coronary stenosis severity and the acute
      perfusion change after grafting; there is an association between functional
      stenosis severity and absolute increase in regional myocardial perfusion after
      CABG.

TI  - Effect of Surgical Release of Entrapped Peripheral Nerves in Sensorimotor
      Diabetic Neuropathy on Pain and Sensory Dysfunction—Study Protocol of a
      Prospective, Controlled Clinical Trial.
LID - 348
AB  - Background: Nerve entrapment has been hypothesized to contribute to the
      multicausal etiology of axonopathy in sensorimotor diabetic neuropathy. Targeted 
      surgical decompression reduces external strain on the affected nerve and,
      therefore, may alleviate symptoms, including pain and sensory dysfunction.
      However, its therapeutic value in this cohort remains unclear. Aim: Quantifying
      the treatment effect of targeted lower extremity nerve decompression in patients 
      with preexisting painful sensorimotor diabetic neuropathy and nerve entrapment on
      pain intensity, sensory function, motor function, and neural signal conduction.
      Study design: This prospective, controlled trial studies 40 patients suffering
      from bilateral therapy-refractory, painful (n = 20, visual analogue scale, VAS ≥ 
      5) or painless (n = 20, VAS = 0) sensorimotor diabetic neuropathy with clinical
      and/or radiologic signs of focal lower extremity nerve compression who underwent 
      unilateral surgical nerve decompression of the common peroneal and the tibial
      nerve. Tissue biopsies will be analyzed to explore perineural tissue remodeling
      in correlation with intraoperatively measured nerve compression pressure. Effect 
      size on symptoms including pain intensity, light touch threshold, static and
      moving two-point discrimination, target muscle force, and nerve conduction
      velocity will be quantified 3, 6, and 12 months postoperatively, and compared (1)
      to the preoperative values and (2) to the contralateral lower extremity that
      continues non-operative management. Clinical significance: Targeted surgical
      release may alleviate mechanical strain on entrapped lower extremity nerves and
      thereby potentially improve pain and sensory dysfunction in a subset of patients 
      suffering from diabetic neuropathy. This trial aims to shed light on these
      patients that potentially benefit from screening for lower extremity nerve
      entrapment, as typical symptoms of entrapment might be erroneously attributed to 
      neuropathy only, thereby preventing adequate treatment.

TI  - Metagenomic Screening for Lipolytic Genes Reveals an Ecology-Clustered
      Distribution Pattern.
LID - 851969
AB  - Lipolytic enzymes are one of the most important enzyme types for application in
      various industrial processes. Despite the continuously increasing demand, only a 
      small portion of the so far encountered lipolytic enzymes exhibit adequate
      stability and activities for biotechnological applications. To explore novel
      and/or extremophilic lipolytic enzymes, microbial consortia in two composts at
      thermophilic stage were analyzed using function-driven and sequence-based
      metagenomic approaches. Analysis of community composition by amplicon-based 16S
      rRNA genes and transcripts, and direct metagenome sequencing revealed that the
      communities of the compost samples were dominated by members of the phyla
      Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, and Chloroflexi.
      Function-driven screening of the metagenomic libraries constructed from the two
      samples yielded 115 unique lipolytic enzymes. The family assignment of these
      enzymes was conducted by analyzing the phylogenetic relationship and generation
      of a protein sequence similarity network according to an integrated
      classification system. The sequence-based screening was performed by using a
      newly developed database, containing a set of profile Hidden Markov models,
      highly sensitive and specific for detection of lipolytic enzymes. By comparing
      the lipolytic enzymes identified through both approaches, we demonstrated that
      the activity-directed complements sequence-based detection, and vice versa. The
      sequence-based comparative analysis of lipolytic genes regarding diversity,
      function and taxonomic origin derived from 175 metagenomes indicated significant 
      differences between habitats. Analysis of the prevalent and distinct microbial
      groups providing the lipolytic genes revealed characteristic patterns and groups 
      driven by ecological factors. The here presented data suggests that the diversity
      and distribution of lipolytic genes in metagenomes of various habitats are
      largely constrained by ecological factors.

TI  - RCSB Protein Data Bank (RCSB.org): delivery of experimentally-determined PDB
      structures alongside one million computed structure models of proteins from
      artificial intelligence/machine learning.
PG  - D488-508
AB  - The Research Collaboratory for Structural Bioinformatics Protein Data Bank (RCSB 
      PDB), founding member of the Worldwide Protein Data Bank (wwPDB), is the US data 
      center for the open-access PDB archive. As wwPDB-designated Archive Keeper, RCSB 
      PDB is also responsible for PDB data security. Annually, RCSB PDB serves >10 000 
      depositors of three-dimensional (3D) biostructures working on all permanently
      inhabited continents. RCSB PDB delivers data from its research-focused RCSB.org
      web portal to many millions of PDB data consumers based in virtually every United
      Nations-recognized country, territory, etc. This Database Issue contribution
      describes upgrades to the research-focused RCSB.org web portal that created a
      one-stop-shop for open access to ∼200 000 experimentally-determined PDB
      structures of biological macromolecules alongside >1 000 000 incorporated
      Computed Structure Models (CSMs) predicted using artificial intelligence/machine 
      learning methods. RCSB.org is a ‘living data resource.’ Every PDB structure and
      CSM is integrated weekly with related functional annotations from external
      biodata resources, providing up-to-date information for the entire corpus of 3D
      biostructure data freely available from RCSB.org with no usage limitations.
      Within RCSB.org, PDB structures and the CSMs are clearly identified as to their
      provenance and reliability. Both are fully searchable, and can be analyzed and
      visualized using the full complement of RCSB.org web portal capabilities.

TI  - Cholesteryl hemiazelate identified in CVD patients causes in vitro and in vivo
      inflammation.
LID - 100419
AB  - Oxidation of PUFAs in LDLs trapped in the arterial intima plays a critical role
      in atherosclerosis. Though there have been many studies on the atherogenicity of 
      oxidized derivatives of PUFA-esters of cholesterol, the effects of cholesteryl
      hemiesters (ChEs), the oxidation end products of these esters, have not been
      studied. Through lipidomics analyses, we identified and quantified two ChE types 
      in the plasma of CVD patients and identified four ChE types in human
      endarterectomy specimens. Cholesteryl hemiazelate (ChA), the ChE of azelaic acid 
      (n-nonane-1,9-dioic acid), was the most prevalent ChE identified in both cases.
      Importantly, human monocytes, monocyte-derived macrophages, and neutrophils
      exhibit inflammatory features when exposed to subtoxic concentrations of ChA
      in vitro. ChA increases the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines such as
      interleukin-1β and interleukin-6 and modulates the surface-marker profile of
      monocytes and monocyte-derived macrophage. In vivo, when zebrafish larvae were
      fed with a ChA-enriched diet, they exhibited neutrophil and macrophage
      accumulation in the vasculature in a caspase 1- and cathepsin B-dependent manner.
      ChA also triggered lipid accumulation at the bifurcation sites of the vasculature
      of the zebrafish larvae and negatively impacted their life expectancy. We
      conclude that ChA behaves as an endogenous damage-associated molecular pattern
      with inflammatory and proatherogenic properties.

TI  - Protein shape sampled by ion mobility mass spectrometry consistently improves
      protein structure prediction.
LID - 4377
AB  - Ion mobility (IM) mass spectrometry provides structural information about protein
      shape and size in the form of an orientationally-averaged collision cross-section
      (CCSIM). While IM data have been used with various computational methods, they
      have not yet been utilized to predict monomeric protein structure from sequence. 
      Here, we show that IM data can significantly improve protein structure
      determination using the modelling suite Rosetta. We develop the Rosetta
      Projection Approximation using Rough Circular Shapes (PARCS) algorithm that
      allows for fast and accurate prediction of CCSIM from structure. Following
      successful testing of the PARCS algorithm, we use an integrative modelling
      approach to utilize IM data for protein structure prediction. Additionally, we
      propose a confidence metric that identifies near native models in the absence of 
      a known structure. The results of this study demonstrate the ability of IM data
      to consistently improve protein structure prediction.

TI  - Technical and Clinical Progress on Robot-Assisted Endovascular Interventions: A
      Review.
LID - 197
AB  - Prior methods of patient care have changed in recent years due to the
      availability of minimally invasive surgical platforms for endovascular
      interventions. These platforms have demonstrated the ability to improve patients’
      vascular intervention outcomes, and global morbidities and mortalities from
      vascular disease are decreasing. Nonetheless, there are still concerns about the 
      long-term effects of exposing interventionalists and patients to the operational 
      hazards in the cath lab, and the perioperative risks that patients undergo. For
      these reasons, robot-assisted vascular interventions were developed to provide
      interventionalists with the ability to perform minimally invasive procedures with
      improved surgical workflow. We conducted a thorough literature search and
      presented a review of 130 studies published within the last 20 years that focused
      on robot-assisted endovascular interventions and are closely related to the
      current gains and obstacles of vascular interventional robots published up to
      2022. We assessed both the research-based prototypes and commercial products,
      with an emphasis on their technical characteristics and application domains.
      Furthermore, we outlined how the robotic platforms enhanced both surgeons’ and
      patients’ perioperative experiences of robot-assisted vascular interventions.
      Finally, we summarized our findings and proposed three key milestones that could 
      improve the development of the next-generation vascular interventional robots.

TI  - Terabase-Scale Coassembly of a Tropical Soil Microbiome.
LID - e00200-23
AB  - Petabases of environmental metagenomic data are publicly available, presenting an
      opportunity to characterize complex environments and discover novel lineages of
      life. Metagenome coassembly, in which many metagenomic samples from an
      environment are simultaneously analyzed to infer the underlying genomes’
      sequences, is an essential tool for achieving this goal. We applied MetaHipMer2, 
      a distributed metagenome assembler that runs on supercomputing clusters, to
      coassemble 3.4 terabases (Tbp) of metagenome data from a tropical soil in the
      Luquillo Experimental Forest (LEF), Puerto Rico. The resulting coassembly yielded
      39 high-quality (>90% complete, <5% contaminated, with predicted 23S, 16S, and 5S
      rRNA genes and ≥18 tRNAs) metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs), including two from
      the candidate phylum Eremiobacterota. Another 268 medium-quality (≥50% complete, 
      <10% contaminated) MAGs were extracted, including the candidate phyla
      Dependentiae, Dormibacterota, and Methylomirabilota. In total, 307 medium- or
      higher-quality MAGs were assigned to 23 phyla, compared to 294 MAGs assigned to
      nine phyla in the same samples individually assembled. The low-quality (<50%
      complete, <10% contaminated) MAGs from the coassembly revealed a 49% complete
      rare biosphere microbe from the candidate phylum FCPU426 among other
      low-abundance microbes, an 81% complete fungal genome from the phylum Ascomycota,
      and 30 partial eukaryotic MAGs with ≥10% completeness, possibly representing
      protist lineages. A total of 22,254 viruses, many of them low abundance, were
      identified. Estimation of metagenome coverage and diversity indicates that we may
      have characterized ≥87.5% of the sequence diversity in this humid tropical soil
      and indicates the value of future terabase-scale sequencing and coassembly of
      complex environments.IMPORTANCE Petabases of reads are being produced by
      environmental metagenome sequencing. An essential step in analyzing these data is
      metagenome assembly, the computational reconstruction of genome sequences from
      microbial communities. “Coassembly” of metagenomic sequence data, in which
      multiple samples are assembled together, enables more complete detection of
      microbial genomes in an environment than “multiassembly,” in which samples are
      assembled individually. To demonstrate the potential for coassembling terabases
      of metagenome data to drive biological discovery, we applied MetaHipMer2, a
      distributed metagenome assembler that runs on supercomputing clusters, to
      coassemble 3.4 Tbp of reads from a humid tropical soil environment. The resulting
      coassembly, its functional annotation, and analysis are presented here. The
      coassembly yielded more, and phylogenetically more diverse, microbial,
      eukaryotic, and viral genomes than the multiassembly of the same data. Our
      resource may facilitate the discovery of novel microbial biology in tropical
      soils and demonstrates the value of terabase-scale metagenome sequencing.

TI  - The role of microglial LRRK2 kinase in manganese-induced inflammatory
      neurotoxicity via NLRP3 inflammasome and RAB10-mediated autophagy dysfunction.
LID - 104879
AB  - Chronic manganese (Mn) exposure can lead to manganism, a neurological disorder
      sharing common symptoms with Parkinson's disease (PD). Studies have shown that Mn
      can increase the expression and activity of leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2),
      leading to inflammation and toxicity in microglia. LRRK2 G2019S mutation also
      elevates LRRK2 kinase activity. Thus, we tested if Mn-increased microglial LRRK2 
      kinase is responsible for Mn-induced toxicity, and exacerbated by G2019S
      mutation, using WT and LRRK2 G2019S knock-in mice and BV2 microglia. Mn
      (30 mg/kg, nostril instillation, daily for 3 weeks) caused motor deficits,
      cognitive impairments, and dopaminergic dysfunction in WT mice, which were
      exacerbated in G2019S mice. Mn induced proapoptotic Bax, NLRP3 inflammasome,
      IL-1β, and TNF-α in the striatum and midbrain of WT mice, and these effects were 
      more pronounced in G2019S mice. BV2 microglia were transfected with human LRRK2
      WT or G2019S, followed by Mn (250 μM) exposure to better characterize its
      mechanistic action. Mn increased TNF-α, IL-1β, and NLRP3 inflammasome activation 
      in BV2 cells expressing WT LRRK2, which was elevated further in G2019S-expressing
      cells, while pharmacological inhibition of LRRK2 mitigated these effects in both 
      genotypes. Moreover, the media from Mn-treated G2019S-expressing BV2 microglia
      caused greater toxicity to the cath.a-differentiated (CAD) neuronal cells
      compared to media from microglia expressing WT. Mn-LRRK2 activated RAB10 which
      was exacerbated in G2019S. RAB10 played a critical role in LRRK2-mediated Mn
      toxicity by dysregulating the autophagy-lysosome pathway and NLRP3 inflammasome
      in microglia. Our novel findings suggest that microglial LRRK2 via RAB10 plays a 
      critical role in Mn-induced neuroinflammation.

TI  - HGCA2.0: An RNA-Seq Based Webtool for Gene Coexpression Analysis in Homo sapiens.
LID - 388
AB  - Genes with similar expression patterns in a set of diverse samples may be
      considered coexpressed. Human Gene Coexpression Analysis 2.0 (HGCA2.0) is a
      webtool which studies the global coexpression landscape of human genes. The
      website is based on the hierarchical clustering of 55,431 Homo sapiens genes
      based on a large-scale coexpression analysis of 3500 GTEx bulk RNA-Seq samples of
      healthy individuals, which were selected as the best representative samples of
      each tissue type. HGCA2.0 presents subclades of coexpressed genes to a gene of
      interest, and performs various built-in gene term enrichment analyses on the
      coexpressed genes, including gene ontologies, biological pathways, protein
      families, and diseases, while also being unique in revealing enriched
      transcription factors driving coexpression. HGCA2.0 has been successful in
      identifying not only genes with ubiquitous expression patterns, but also
      tissue-specific genes. Benchmarking showed that HGCA2.0 belongs to the top
      performing coexpression webtools, as shown by STRING analysis. HGCA2.0 creates
      working hypotheses for the discovery of gene partners or common biological
      processes that can be experimentally validated. It offers a simple and intuitive 
      website design and user interface, as well as an API endpoint.

TI  - Metabolomics analysis of milk thistle lipids to identify drought-tolerant genes.
LID - 12827
AB  - Milk thistle is an oil and medicinal crop known as an alternative oil crop with a
      high level of unsaturated fatty acids, which makes it a favorable edible oil for 
      use in food production. To evaluate the importance of Milk thistle lipids in
      drought tolerance, an experiment was performed in field conditions under three
      different water deficit levels (Field capacity (FC), 70% FC and 40% FC). After
      harvesting seeds of the plant, their oily and methanolic extracts were isolated, 
      and subsequently, types and amounts of lipids were measured using GC–MS. Genes
      and enzymes engaged in biosynthesizing of these lipids were identified and their 
      expression in Arabidopsis was investigated under similar conditions. The results 
      showed that content of almost all measured lipids of milk thistle decreased under
      severe drought stress, but genes (belonged to Arabidopsis), which were involved
      in their biosynthetic pathway showed different expression patterns. Genes
      biosynthesizing lipids, which had significant amounts were selected and their
      gene and metabolic network were established. Two networks were correlated, and
      for each pathway, their lipids and respective biosynthesizing genes were grouped 
      together. Four up-regulated genes including PXG3, LOX2, CYP710A1, PAL and 4
      down-regulated genes including FATA2, CYP86A1, LACS3, PLA2-ALPHA were selected.
      The expression of these eight genes in milk thistle was similar to Arabidopsis
      under drought stress. Thus, PXG3, PAL, LOX2 and CYP86A1 genes that increased
      expression were selected for protein analysis. Due to the lack of protein
      structure of these genes in the milk thistle, modeling homology was performed for
      them. The results of molecular docking showed that the four proteins CYP86A1,
      LOX2, PAL and PXG3 bind to ligands HEM, 11O, ACT and LIG, respectively. HEM
      ligand was involved in production of secondary metabolites and dehydration
      tolerance, and HEM binding site remained conserved in various plants. CA ligands 
      were involved in synthesis of cuticles and waxes. Overall, this study confirmed
      the importance of lipids in drought stress tolerance in milk thistle.

TI  - A truncated peptide Spgillcin177–189 derived from mud crab Scylla paramamosain
      exerting multiple antibacterial activities.
LID - 928220
AB  - Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) may be the most promising substitute for
      antibiotics due to their effective bactericidal activity and multiple
      antimicrobial modes against pathogenic bacteria. In this study, a new functional 
      gene named Spgillcin was identified in Scylla paramamosain, which encoded 216
      amino acids of mature peptide. In vivo, Spgillcin was dominantly expressed in the
      gills of male and female crabs, offering the highest expression level among all
      tested organs or tissues. The expression pattern of Spgillcin was significantly
      altered when challenged by Staphylococcus aureus, indicating a positive immune
      response. In vitro, a functional truncated peptide Spgillcin177–189 derived from 
      the amino acid sequence of Spgillcin was synthesized and showed a broad-spectrum 
      and potent antibacterial activity against several bacterial strains, including
      the clinical isolates of multidrug-resistant (MDR) strains, with a range of
      minimum inhibitory concentrations from 1.5 to 48 μM. Spgillcin177–189 also showed
      rapid bactericidal kinetics for S. aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa but did not 
      display any cytotoxicity to mammalian cells and maintained its antimicrobial
      activity in different conditions. Mechanistic studies indicated that
      Spgillcin177–189 was mainly involved in the disruption of cell membrane integrity
      where the membrane components lipoteichoic acid and lipopolysaccharide could
      significantly inhibit the antimicrobial activity in a dose-dependent manner. In
      addition, Spgillcin177–189 could change the membrane permeability and cause the
      accumulation of intracellular reactive oxygen species. No resistance was
      generated to Spgillcin177–189 when the clinical isolates of methicillin-resistant
      S. aureus and MDR P. aeruginosa were treated with Spgillcin177–189 and then
      subjected to a long term of continuous culturing for 50 days. In addition,
      Spgillcin177–189 exerted a strong anti-biofilm activity by inhibiting biofilm
      formation and was also effective at killing extracellular S. aureus in the
      cultural supernatant of RAW 264.7 cells. Taken together, Spgillcin177–189 has
      strong potential as a substitute for antibiotics in future aquaculture and
      medical applications.

TI  - Low-level language processing in brain-injured patients.
LID - fcad094
AB  - Assessing cognitive function—especially language processing—in severely
      brain-injured patients is critical for prognostication, care, and development of 
      communication devices (e.g. brain–computer interfaces). In patients with
      diminished motor function, language processing has been probed using EEG measures
      of command-following in motor imagery tasks. While such tests eliminate the need 
      for motor response, they require sustained attention. However, passive listening 
      tasks, with an EEG response measure can reduce both motor and attentional
      demands. These considerations motivated the development of two assays of
      low-level language processing—identification of differential phoneme-class
      responses and tracking of the natural speech envelope. This cross-sectional study
      looks at a cohort of 26 severely brain-injured patient subjects and 10 healthy
      controls. Patients’ level of function was assessed via the coma recovery
      scale–revised at the bedside. Patients were also tested for command-following via
      EEG and/or MRI assays of motor imagery. For the present investigation, EEG was
      recorded while presenting a 148 s audio clip of Alice in Wonderland. Time-locked 
      EEG responses to phoneme classes were extracted and compared to determine a
      differential phoneme-class response. Tracking of the natural speech envelope was 
      assessed from the same recordings by cross-correlating the EEG response with the 
      speech envelope. In healthy controls, the dynamics of the two measures were
      temporally similar but spatially different: a central parieto-occipital component
      of differential phoneme-class response was absent in the natural speech envelope 
      response. The differential phoneme-class response was present in all patient
      subjects, including the six classified as vegetative state/unresponsive
      wakefulness syndrome by behavioural assessment. However, patient subjects with
      evidence of language processing either by behavioural assessment or motor imagery
      tests had an early bilateral response in the first 50 ms that was lacking in
      patient subjects without any evidence of language processing. The natural speech 
      envelope tracking response was also present in all patient subjects and responses
      in the first 100 ms distinguished patient subjects with evidence of language
      processing. Specifically, patient subjects with evidence of language processing
      had a more global response in the first 100 ms whereas those without evidence of 
      language processing had a frontopolar response in that period. In summary, we
      developed two passive EEG-based methods to probe low-level language processing in
      severely brain-injured patients. In our cohort, both assays showed a difference
      between patient subjects with evidence of command-following and those with no
      evidence of command-following: a more prominent early bilateral response
      component.

TI  - Phosphatidylinositol (3,5)-bisphosphate machinery regulates neurite thickness
      through neuron-specific endosomal protein NSG1/NEEP21.
LID - 102775
AB  - Phosphatidylinositol (3,5)-bisphosphate [PtdIns(3,5)P2] is a critical signaling
      phospholipid involved in endolysosome homeostasis. It is synthesized by a protein
      complex composed of PIKfyve, Vac14, and Fig4. Defects in PtdIns(3,5)P2 synthesis 
      underlie a number of human neurological disorders, including Charcot-Marie-Tooth 
      disease, child onset progressive dystonia, and others. However, neuron-specific
      functions of PtdIns(3,5)P2 remain less understood. Here, we show that
      PtdIns(3,5)P2 pathway is required to maintain neurite thickness. Suppression of
      PIKfyve activities using either pharmacological inhibitors or RNA silencing
      resulted in decreased neurite thickness. We further find that the regulation of
      neurite thickness by PtdIns(3,5)P2 is mediated by NSG1/NEEP21, a neuron-specific 
      endosomal protein. Knockdown of NSG1 expression also led to thinner neurites.
      mCherry-tagged NSG1 colocalized and interacted with proteins in the PtdIns(3,5)P2
      machinery. Perturbation of PtdIns(3,5)P2 dynamics by overexpressing Fig4 or a
      PtdIns(3,5)P2-binding domain resulted in mislocalization of NSG1 to nonendosomal 
      locations, and suppressing PtdIns(3,5)P2 synthesis resulted in an accumulation of
      NSG1 in EEA1-positive early endosomes. Importantly, overexpression of NSG1
      rescued neurite thinning in PtdIns(3,5)P2-deficient CAD neurons and primary
      cortical neurons. Our study uncovered the role of PtdIns(3,5)P2 in the
      morphogenesis of neurons, which revealed a novel aspect of the pathogenesis of
      PtdIns(3,5)P2-related neuropathies. We also identified NSG1 as an important
      downstream protein of PtdIns(3,5)P2, which may provide a novel therapeutic target
      in neurological diseases.

TI  - Assessment of the Severity of Left Anterior Descending Coronary Artery Stenoses
      by Enhanced Transthoracic Doppler Echocardiography: Validation of a Method Based 
      on the Continuity Equation.
LID - 2526
AB  - Background: To verify whether the severity of coronary stenosis could be
      non-invasively assessed by enhanced transthoracic coronary echo Doppler in
      convergent color Doppler mode (E-Doppler TTE) over a wide range of values (from
      mild to severe). Methods: Color-guided pulsed wave Doppler sampling in the left
      anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) was performed in 103 diseased LAD
      segments (corresponding to 94 patients examined) as assessed by quantitative
      coronary angiography (QCA) or intracoronary ultrasound (IVUS). The E-Doppler TTE 
      examinations consisted of measuring the velocity (vel) at the stenosis site and a
      reference adjacent segment. Then the continuity equation (C-Eq) was applied to
      calculate the percent cross-sectional area reduction (%CSA) at the stenosis site.
      The applied formula was: %CSA = 100 × (1 − [TVIref × 0.5]/TVIs). TVI = the time
      velocity integral at the stenosis [s] and the reference site [ref],
      respectively); 0.5 = the correcting factor for a parabolic profile was used only 
      when the % accelerated stenotic flow was >122% (AsF = diastolic peak vel at first
      site − diastolic peak vel at second site/diastolic peak vel at second site ×
      100). Results: E-Doppler TTE feasibility was 100%. Doppler and QCA/IVUS-derived
      %CSA stenosis showed very good agreement over a large range of values (from mild 
      to severe), with no significant bias; the maximum difference between QCA/IVUS and
      transthoracic Doppler %CSA was mostly around 20% with a few patients exceeding
      this limit (limits of agreement = −27.53 to 23.5%). The scattering was slightly
      larger for the non-significant stenoses. The correlation was strong (r = 0.89, p 
      < 0.001). Conclusion: E-Doppler TTE is a feasible and reliable method for
      assessing the severity of LAD stenosis by applying the C-Eq.

TI  - Fluorogenic Granzyme A Substrates Enable Real‐Time Imaging of Adaptive Immune
      Cell Activity.
LID - e202216142
AB  - Cytotoxic immune cells, including T lymphocytes (CTLs) and natural killer (NK)
      cells, are essential components of the host response against tumors. CTLs and NK 
      cells secrete granzyme A (GzmA) upon recognition of cancer cells; however, there 
      are very few tools that can detect physiological levels of active GzmA with high 
      spatiotemporal resolution. Herein, we report the rational design of the
      near‐infrared fluorogenic substrates for human GzmA and mouse GzmA. These
      activity‐based probes display very high catalytic efficiency and selectivity over
      other granzymes, as shown in tissue lysates from wild‐type and GzmA knock‐out
      mice. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the probes can image how adaptive immune
      cells respond to antigen‐driven recognition of cancer cells in real time.

TI  - The actin binding protein profilin 1 is critical for mitochondria function.
LID - 2023.08.07.552354
AB  - Profilin 1 (PFN1) is an actin binding protein that is vital for the
      polymerization of monomeric actin into filaments. Here we screened knockout cells
      for novel functions of PFN1 and discovered that mitophagy, a type of selective
      autophagy that removes defective or damaged mitochondria from the cell, was
      significantly upregulated in the absence of PFN1. Despite successful
      autophagosome formation and fusion with the lysosome, and activation of
      additional mitochondrial quality control pathways, PFN1 knockout cells still
      accumulate damaged, dysfunctional mitochondria. Subsequent imaging and functional
      assays showed that loss of PFN1 significantly affects mitochondria morphology,
      dynamics, and respiration. Further experiments revealed that PFN1 is located to
      the mitochondria matrix and is likely regulating mitochondria function from
      within rather than through polymerizing actin at the mitochondria surface.
      Finally, PFN1 mutants associated with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) fail to
      rescue PFN1 knockout mitochondrial phenotypes and form aggregates within
      mitochondria, further perturbing them. Together, these results suggest a novel
      function for PFN1 in regulating mitochondria and identify a potential pathogenic 
      mechanism of ALS-linked PFN1 variants.

TI  - Efficacy of Intravenously Administered Gepotidacin in Cynomolgus Macaques
      following a Francisella tularensis Inhalational Challenge.
LID - e01381-22
AB  - Francisella tularensis (F. tularensis) is a Centers for Disease Control (CDC)
      category “A” Gram-negative biothreat pathogen. Inhalation of F. tularensis can
      cause pneumonia and respiratory failure and is associated with high mortality
      rates without early treatment. Gepotidacin is a novel, first-in-class
      triazaacenaphthylene antibiotic that inhibits bacterial DNA replication by a
      distinct mechanism of action. Gepotidacin selectively inhibits bacterial DNA
      replication via a unique binding mode, has activity against multidrug-resistant
      target pathogens, and has demonstrated in vitro activity against diverse
      collections of F. tularensis isolates (MIC90 of 0.5 to 1 μg/mL). Gepotidacin was 
      evaluated in the cynomolgus macaque model of inhalational tularemia, using the
      SCHU S4 strain, with treatment initiated after exposure and sustained fever.
      Macaques were dosed via intravenous (i.v.) infusion with saline or gepotidacin at
      72 mg/kg/day to support a human i.v. infusion dosing regimen of 1,000 mg three
      times daily. The primary study endpoint was survival, with survival duration and 
      bacterial clearance as secondary endpoints. Gepotidacin treatment resulted in
      100% survival compared to 12.5% in the saline-treated control group (P < 0.0001) 
      at Day 43 postinhalational challenge. All gepotidacin-treated animals were blood 
      and organ culture negative for F. tularensis at the end of the study. In
      contrast, none of the saline control animals were blood and organ culture
      negative. Gepotoidacin’s novel mechanism of action and the efficacy data reported
      here (aligned with the Food and Drug Administration Animal Rule) support
      gepotidacin as a potential treatment for pneumonic tularemia in an emergency
      biothreat situation.

TI  - Exploration of novel αβ-protein folds through de novo design.
PG  - 1132-40
AB  - A fundamental question in protein evolution is whether nature has exhaustively
      sampled nearly all possible protein folds throughout evolution, or whether a
      large fraction of the possible folds remains unexplored. To address this
      question, we defined a set of rules for β-sheet topology to predict novel
      αβ-folds and carried out a systematic de novo protein design exploration of the
      novel αβ-folds predicted by the rules. The designs for all eight of the predicted
      novel αβ-folds with a four-stranded β-sheet, including a knot-forming one, folded
      into structures close to the design models. Further, the rules predicted more
      than 10,000 novel αβ-folds with five- to eight-stranded β-sheets; this number far
      exceeds the number of αβ-folds observed in nature so far. This result suggests
      that a vast number of αβ-folds are possible, but have not emerged or have become 
      extinct due to evolutionary bias.

TI  - Molecular characterization of Richter syndrome identifies de novo diffuse large
      B-cell lymphomas with poor prognosis.
LID - 309
AB  - Richter syndrome (RS) is the transformation of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)
      into aggressive lymphoma, most commonly diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). We
      characterize 58 primary human RS samples by genome-wide DNA methylation and
      whole-transcriptome profiling. Our comprehensive approach determines RS DNA
      methylation profile and unravels a CLL epigenetic imprint, allowing CLL-RS clonal
      relationship assessment without the need of the initial CLL tumor DNA. DNA
      methylation- and transcriptomic-based classifiers were developed, and testing on 
      landmark DLBCL datasets identifies a poor-prognosis, activated B-cell-like DLBCL 
      subset in 111/1772 samples. The classification robustly identifies phenotypes
      very similar to RS with a specific genomic profile, accounting for 4.3-8.3% of de
      novo DLBCLs. In this work, RS multi-omics characterization determines oncogenic
      mechanisms, establishes a surrogate marker for CLL-RS clonal relationship, and
      provides a clinically relevant classifier for a subset of primary “RS-type DLBCL”
      with unfavorable prognosis.

TI  - Interventional cardiovascular magnetic resonance: state-of-the-art.
LID - 48
AB  - Transcatheter cardiovascular interventions increasingly rely on advanced imaging.
      X-ray fluoroscopy provides excellent visualization of catheters and devices, but 
      poor visualization of anatomy. In contrast, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
      provides excellent visualization of anatomy and can generate real-time imaging
      with frame rates similar to X-ray fluoroscopy. Realization of MRI as a primary
      imaging modality for cardiovascular interventions has been slow, largely because 
      existing guidewires, catheters and other devices create imaging artifacts and can
      heat dangerously. Nonetheless, numerous clinical centers have started
      interventional cardiovascular magnetic resonance (iCMR) programs for invasive
      hemodynamic studies or electrophysiology procedures to leverage the clear
      advantages of MRI tissue characterization, to quantify cardiac chamber function
      and flow, and to avoid ionizing radiation exposure. Clinical implementation of
      more complex cardiovascular interventions has been challenging because catheters 
      and other tools require re-engineering for safety and conspicuity in the iCMR
      environment. However, recent innovations in scanner and interventional device
      technology, in particular availability of high performance low-field MRI scanners
      could be the inflection point, enabling a new generation of iCMR procedures. In
      this review we review these technical considerations, summarize contemporary
      clinical iCMR experience, and consider potential future applications.

TI  - Blood speckle imaging compared with conventional Doppler ultrasound for
      transvalvular pressure drop estimation in an aortic flow phantom.
LID - 18
AB  - Background: Transvalvular pressure drops are assessed using Doppler
      echocardiography for the diagnosis of heart valve disease. However, this method
      is highly user-dependent and may overestimate transvalvular pressure drops by up 
      to 54%. This work aimed to assess transvalvular pressure drops using velocity
      fields derived from blood speckle imaging (BSI), as a potential alternative to
      Doppler.  Methods: A silicone 3D-printed aortic valve model, segmented from a
      healthy CT scan, was placed within a silicone tube. A CardioFlow 5000MR flow pump
      was used to circulate blood mimicking fluid to create eight different stenotic
      conditions. Eight PendoTech pressure sensors were embedded along the tube wall to
      record ground-truth pressures (10 kHz). The simplified Bernoulli equation with
      measured probe angle correction was used to estimate pressure drop from maximum
      velocity values acquired across the valve using Doppler and BSI with a GE Vivid
      E95 ultrasound machine and 6S-D cardiac phased array transducer. Results: There
      were no significant differences between pressure drops estimated by Doppler, BSI 
      and ground-truth at the lowest stenotic condition (10.4 ± 1.76, 10.3 ± 1.63 vs.
      10.5 ± 1.00 mmHg, respectively; p > 0.05). Significant differences were observed 
      between the pressure drops estimated by the three methods at the greatest
      stenotic condition (26.4 ± 1.52, 14.5 ± 2.14 vs. 20.9 ± 1.92 mmHg for Doppler,
      BSI and ground-truth, respectively; p < 0.05). Across all conditions, Doppler
      overestimated pressure drop (Bias = 3.92 mmHg), while BSI underestimated pressure
      drop (Bias = -3.31 mmHg). Conclusions: BSI accurately estimated pressure drops
      only up to 10.5 mmHg in controlled phantom conditions of low stenotic burden.
      Doppler overestimated pressure drops of 20.9 mmHg. Although BSI offers a number
      of theoretical advantages to conventional Doppler echocardiography, further
      refinements and clinical studies are required with BSI before it can be used to
      improve transvalvular pressure drop estimation in the clinical evaluation of
      aortic stenosis. Supplementary Information: The online version contains
      supplementary material available at 10.1186/s12947-022-00286-1.

TI  - Recent Advances and Progress on Melanin: From Source to Application.
LID - 4360
AB  - Melanin is a biological pigment formed by indoles and phenolic compounds. It is
      widely found in living organisms and has a variety of unique properties. Due to
      its diverse characteristics and good biocompatibility, melanin has become the
      focus in the fields of biomedicine, agriculture, the food industry, etc. However,
      due to the wide range of melanin sources, complex polymerization properties, and 
      low solubility of specific solvents, the specific macromolecular structure and
      polymerization mechanism of melanin remain unclear, which significantly limits
      the further study and application of melanin. Its synthesis and degradation
      pathways are also controversial. In addition, new properties and applications of 
      melanin are constantly being discovered. In this review, we focus on the recent
      advances in the research of melanin in all aspects. Firstly, the classification, 
      source, and degradation of melanin are summarized. Secondly, a detailed
      description of the structure, characterization, and properties of melanin is
      followed. The novel biological activity of melanin and its application is
      described at the end.

TI  - International good practices on central venous catheters' placement and daily
      management in adults and on educational interventions addressed to healthcare
      professionals or awake/outpatients. Results of a scoping review compared with the
      existent Italian good practices.
LID - 943164
AB  - This scoping review aims to check the existing international literature related
      to the placement and management of central venous catheters (CVCs) in adults and 
      compare them with the Good Practices published by the Italian Society of
      anesthesiology intensive care (hereafter “SIAARTI Good Practices”) and the
      protocols written by the Italian Expert group on long-term central venous
      accesses (hereafter “GAVeCeLT Protocols”) and verify the existence of experiences
      focused on the daily assessment of the implantation site and on educational
      interventions on awake patients or caregivers to enhance their empowerment. A
      systematic search approach has been applied. Our composite research question has 
      been primarily defined by the PICO: only patients over 18 years of age with CVC
      for any clinical reason except for kidney replacement therapy; placement and
      management of CVCs with procedures recommended by the recent international
      guidelines/bundles and specific educational interventions are the interventions
      to be compared with standard CVC placement and management without any educational
      interventions. In total, two different types of outcomes have been taken into
      consideration: catheter-related complications rate (A) and patient/caregiver
      involvement (B). Eligible articles have been limited to Systematic Review OR
      Meta-analysis OR Guidelines in Human field, focusing on adults, English language 
      only, from January 2015 to December 2020. Searched Medical Subject Headings
      (MeSHs) Terms were “venous” AND “catheters,” and the correspondence with the
      designed PICO framework was then checked directly by the authors. A comprehensive
      search was conducted by two reviewers on 15 February 2021 in four databases, and 
      32 full-text articles were finally included and qualitatively assessed. The
      included articles appear to be in line with the indications provided by the
      available Italian Good Practices and explain the complexity of this procedure.
      The need to promote the use of bundles and checklists related to CVC placement
      and dressing procedures comes to light. These organizational technologies can be 
      implemented following the creation of teams dedicated to venous access that are
      subjected to continuous training. As regards the impact of educational
      initiatives, implementing paths of health education and proper hospital discharge
      preparation for both healthcare workers and families increases safety for the
      patient with CVC.

TI  - Amphibian-derived wound healing peptides: chemical molecular treasure trove for
      skin wound treatment.
LID - 1120228
AB  - Amphibian-derived wound healing peptides thus offer new intervention measures and
      strategies for skin wound tissue regeneration. As novel drug lead molecules,
      wound healing peptides can help analyze new mechanisms and discover new drug
      targets. Previous studies have identified various novel wound healing peptides
      and analyzed novel mechanisms in wound healing, especially competing endogenous
      RNAs (ceRNAs) (e.g., inhibition of miR-663a promotes skin repair). In this paper,
      we review amphibian-derived wound healing peptides, including the acquisition,
      identification, and activity of peptides, a combination of peptides with other
      materials, and the analysis of underlying mechanisms, to better understand the
      characteristics of wound healing peptides and to provide a molecular template for
      the development of new wound repair drugs.

TI  - Pulsed field ablation using focal contact force-sensing catheters for treatment
      of atrial fibrillation: acute and 90-day invasive remapping results.
LID - euad147
AB  - Aims: Pulsed field ablation (PFA) has emerged as a promising alternative to
      thermal ablation for treatment of atrial fibrillation (AF). We report performance
      and safety using the CENTAURI™ System (Galvanize Therapeutics) with three
      commercial, focal ablation catheters. Methods and results: ECLIPSE AF
      (NCT04523545) was a prospective, single-arm, multi-centre study evaluating safety
      and acute and chronic pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) durability using the
      CENTAURI System in conjunction with the TactiCath SE, StablePoint, and ThermoCool
      ST ablation catheters. Patients with paroxysmal or persistent AF were treated at 
      two centres. Patients were analysed in five cohorts based upon ablation settings,
      catheter, and mapping system. Pulsed field ablation was performed in 82 patients 
      (74% male, 42 paroxysmal AF). Pulmonary vein isolation was achieved in 100% of
      pulmonary veins (322/322) with first-pass isolation in 92.2% (297/322). There
      were four serious adverse events of interest (three vascular access complications
      and one lacunar stroke). Eighty patients (98%) underwent invasive remapping.
      Pulsed field ablation development Cohorts 1 and 2 showed a per-patient isolation 
      rate of 38% and 26% and a per-PV isolation rate of 47% and 53%, respectively.
      Optimized PFA Cohorts 3–5 showed a per-patient isolation rate of 60%, 73%, and
      81% and a per-PV isolation rate of 84%, 90%, and 92%, respectively. Conclusion:
      ECLIPSE AF demonstrated that optimized PFA using the CENTAURI System with three
      commercial, contact force-sensing, solid-tip focal ablation catheters resulted in
      transmural lesion formation and high proportion of durable PVI with a favourable 
      safety profile, thus providing a viable treatment option for AF that integrates
      with contemporary focal ablation workflows.

TI  - A generic framework for hierarchical de novo protein design.
LID - e2206111119
AB  - Computational de novo protein design strategies to generate synthetic proteins
      outside of the natural repertoire stand as a rigorous test of our understanding
      of protein folding and have had considerable impact on biotechnological
      applications. However, current de novo design methods are severely hindered by
      creating designable protein backbone templates that can be realized with natural 
      amino acids. We present an algorithm that automatically generates novel proteins 
      from a minimal string definition with native-like geometries and show that
      current methods are insufficient for the generation of designable backbones. The 
      variety of de novo designed proteins and the computational method should
      enlighten basic protein topological principles and facilitate the generation of
      de novo proteins to enable the exploration of the protein universe.

TI  - Prediction and expression analysis of deleterious nonsynonymous SNPs of
      Arabidopsis ACD11 gene by combining computational algorithms and molecular
      docking approach.
LID - e1009539
AB  - Accelerated cell death 11 (ACD11) is an autoimmune gene that suppresses pathogen 
      infection in plants by preventing plant cells from becoming infected by any
      pathogen. This gene is widely known for growth inhibition, premature leaf
      chlorosis, and defense-related programmed cell death (PCD) in seedlings before
      flowering in Arabidopsis plant. Specific amino acid changes in the ACD11
      protein’s highly conserved domains are linked to autoimmune symptoms including
      constitutive defensive responses and necrosis without pathogen awareness. The
      molecular aspect of the aberrant activity of the ACD11 protein is difficult to
      ascertain. The purpose of our study was to find the most deleterious mutation
      position in the ACD11 protein and correlate them with their abnormal expression
      pattern. Using several computational methods, we discovered PCD vulnerable single
      nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in ACD11. We analysed the RNA-Seq data,
      identified the detrimental nonsynonymous SNPs (nsSNP), built genetically mutated 
      protein structures and used molecular docking to assess the impact of mutation.
      Our results demonstrated that the A15T and A39D mutations in the GLTP domain were
      likely to be extremely detrimental mutations that inhibit the expression of the
      ACD11 protein domain by destabilizing its composition, as well as disrupt its
      catalytic effectiveness. When compared to the A15T mutant, the A39D mutant was
      more likely to destabilize the protein structure. In conclusion, these mutants
      can aid in the better understanding of the vast pool of PCD susceptibilities
      connected to ACD11 gene GLTP domain activation.

      electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction.
LID - 4791
AB  - Water electrolysis to produce ‘green H2’ with renewable energy is a promising
      option for the upcoming green economy. However, the slow and complex oxygen
      evolution reaction at the anode limits the efficiency. Co3O4 with added iron is a
      capable catalyst for this reaction, but the role of iron is presently unclear. To
      investigate this topic, we compare epitaxial Co3O4(111), CoFe2O4(111), and
      Fe3O4(111) thin film model electrocatalysts, combining quasi in-situ preparation 
      and characterization in ultra-high vacuum with electrochemistry experiments. The 
      well-defined composition and structure of the thin epitaxial films permits the
      obtention of quantitatively comparable results. CoFe2O4(111) is found to be up to
      about four times more active than Co3O4(111) and about nine times more than
      Fe3O4(111), with the activity depending acutely on the Co/Fe concentration ratio.
      Under reaction conditions, all three oxides are covered by oxyhydroxide. For
      CoFe2O4(111), the oxyhydroxide’s Fe/Co concentration ratio is stabilized by
      partial iron dissolution.

TI  - Proteome-wide landscape of solubility limits in a bacterial cell.
LID - 6547
AB  - Proteins are prone to aggregate when expressed above their solubility limits.
      Aggregation may occur rapidly, potentially as early as proteins emerge from the
      ribosome, or slowly, following synthesis. However, in vivo data on aggregation
      rates are scarce. Here, we classified the Escherichia coli proteome into rapidly 
      and slowly aggregating proteins using an in vivo image-based screen coupled with 
      machine learning. We find that the majority (70%) of cytosolic proteins that
      become insoluble upon overexpression have relatively low rates of aggregation and
      are unlikely to aggregate co-translationally. Remarkably, such proteins exhibit
      higher folding rates compared to rapidly aggregating proteins, potentially
      implying that they aggregate after reaching their folded states. Furthermore, we 
      find that a substantial fraction (~ 35%) of the proteome remain soluble at
      concentrations much higher than those found naturally, indicating a large margin 
      of safety to tolerate gene expression changes. We show that high disorder content
      and low surface stickiness are major determinants of high solubility and are
      favored in abundant bacterial proteins. Overall, our study provides a global view
      of aggregation rates and hence solubility limits of proteins in a bacterial cell.

TI  - Resuscitative transesophageal echocardiography in the emergency department: a
      single-centre case series.
LID - 24
AB  - Background: Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) is an emerging tool that can
      aid emergency physicians in treating patients in cardiac arrest and
      undifferentiated shock. TEE can aid in diagnosis, resuscitation, identify cardiac
      rhythms, guide chest compression vectors, and shorten sonographic pulse checks.
      This study evaluated the proportion of patients who underwent a change in their
      resuscitation management as a result of emergency department resuscitative TEE.
      Methods: This was a single-centre case series of 25 patients who underwent ED
      resuscitative TEE from 2015 to 2019. The objective of this study is to evaluate
      the feasibility and clinical impact of resuscitative TEE in critically ill
      patients in the emergency department. Data including changes in working
      diagnosis, complications, patient disposition, and survival to hospital discharge
      were also collected. Results: 25 patients (median age 71, 40% female) underwent
      ED resuscitative TEE. All patients were intubated prior to probe insertion and
      adequate TEE views were obtained for every patient. The most common indications
      for resuscitative TEE were cardiac arrest (64%) and undifferentiated shock (28%).
      Resuscitation management changed in 76% (N = 19) and working diagnosis changed in
      76% (N = 19) of patients. Ten patients died in the ED, 15 were admitted to
      hospital, and eight survived to hospital discharge. There were no immediate
      complications (0/15) and two delayed complications (2/15), both of which were
      minor gastrointestinal bleeding. Conclusions: The use of ED resuscitative TEE is 
      a practical modality that provides useful diagnostic and therapeutic information 
      for critically ill patients in the emergency department, with an excellent rate
      of adequate cardiac visualization, and a low complication rate.

TI  - Fragment Libraries Designed to Be Functionally Diverse Recover Protein Binding
      Information More Efficiently Than Standard Structurally Diverse Libraries.
PG  - 11404-13
AB  - Current fragment-based drug design relies on the efficient exploration of
      chemical space by using structurally diverse libraries of small fragments.
      However, structurally dissimilar compounds can exploit the same interactions and 
      thus be functionally similar. Using three-dimensional structures of many
      fragments bound to multiple targets, we examined if a better strategy for
      selecting fragments for screening libraries exists. We show that structurally
      diverse fragments can be described as functionally redundant, often making the
      same interactions. Ranking fragments by the number of novel interactions they
      made, we show that functionally diverse selections of fragments substantially
      increase the amount of information recovered for unseen targets compared to the
      amounts recovered by other methods of selection. Using these results, we design
      small functionally efficient libraries that can give significantly more
      information about new protein targets than similarly sized structurally diverse
      libraries. By covering more functional space, we can generate more diverse sets
      of drug leads.

TI  - Authentication of Covid-19 Vaccines Using Synchronous Fluorescence Spectroscopy.
PG  - 1165-74
AB  - The present study demonstrates the potential of synchronous fluorescence
      spectroscopy and multivariate data analysis for authentication of COVID-19
      vaccines from various manufacturers. Synchronous scanning fluorescence spectra
      were recorded for DNA-based and mRNA-based vaccines obtained through the NHS
      Central Liverpool Primary Care Network. Fluorescence spectra of DNA and DNA-based
      vaccines as well as RNA and RNA-based vaccines were identical to one another. The
      application of principal component analysis (PCA), PCA-Gaussian Mixture Models
      (PCA-GMM)) and Self-Organising Maps (SOM) methods to the fluorescence spectra of 
      vaccines is discussed. The PCA is applied to extract the characteristic variables
      of fluorescence spectra by analysing the major attributes. The results indicated 
      that the first three principal components (PCs) can account for 99.5% of the
      total variance in the data. The PC scores plot showed two distinct clusters
      corresponding to the DNA-based vaccines and mRNA-based vaccines respectively.
      PCA-GMM clustering complemented the PCA clusters by further classifying the
      mRNA-based vaccines and the GMM clusters revealed three mRNA-based vaccines that 
      were not clustered with the other vaccines. SOM complemented both PCA and PCA-GMM
      and proved effective with multivariate data without the need for dimensions
      reduction. The findings showed that fluorescence spectroscopy combined with
      machine learning algorithms (PCA, PCA-GMM and SOM) is a useful technique for
      vaccination verification and has the benefits of simplicity, speed and
      reliability.

TI  - Role of LL-37 in thrombotic complications in patients with COVID-19.
LID - 309
AB  - Blood clot formation induced by dysfunctional coagulation is a frequent
      complication of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and a high-risk factor for
      severe illness and death. Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) are implicated in
      COVID-19-induced immunothrombosis. Furthermore, human cathelicidin, a NET
      component, can perturb the interaction between the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and
      its ACE2 receptor, which mediates viral entry into cells. At present, however,
      the levels of cathelicidin antimicrobial peptides after SARS-CoV-2 infection and 
      their role in COVID-19 thrombosis formation remain unclear. In the current study,
      we analyzed coagulation function and found a decrease in thrombin time but an
      increase in fibrinogen level, prothrombin time, and activated partial
      thromboplastin time in COVID-19 patients. In addition, the cathelicidin
      antimicrobial peptide LL-37 was upregulated by the spike protein and
      significantly elevated in the plasma of patients. Furthermore, LL-37 levels were 
      negatively correlated with thrombin time but positively correlated with
      fibrinogen level. In addition to platelet activation, cathelicidin peptides
      enhanced the activity of coagulation factors, such as factor Xa (FXa) and
      thrombin, which may induce hypercoagulation in diseases with high cathelicidin
      peptide levels. Injection of cathelicidin peptides promoted the formation of
      thrombosis, whereas deletion of cathelicidin inhibited thrombosis in vivo. These 
      results suggest that cathelicidin antimicrobial peptide LL-37 is elevated during 
      SARS-CoV-2 infection, which may induce hypercoagulation in COVID-19 patients by
      activating coagulation factors.Supplementary Information: The online version

TI  - Glucocorticoid-induced microRNA-378 signaling mediates the progression of
      pancreatic cancer by enhancing autophagy.
LID - 1052
AB  - Glucocorticoids (GCs) are widely used in tumor therapy to reduce tumor growth,
      inflammation, edema, and other side effects. Controversially, GCs may also cause 
      the progression of highly aggressive pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC).
      Because microRNA (miR) and autophagy signaling support the invasive growth of
      PDAC, we asked whether these mechanisms may be targeted by GCs. Six established
      human PDAC cell lines, tissue from patients who received GC medication (n = 35)
      prior to surgery, or not (n = 35), and tumor xenografts were examined by RT‒qPCR,
      transmission electron microscopy (TEM), monodansylcadaverine (MDC) staining,
      immunohistochemistry, in situ hybridization, gene array and Kaplan‒Meier analysis
      with bioinformatics, and MTT, western blot, colony, spheroid, migration, and
      invasion assays. We found that various GCs, including dexamethasone (DEX),
      induced typical features of macroautophagy with the appearance of autolysosomes, 
      enhanced LC3-II, decreased SQSTM1/p62 expression and induced
      epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and gemcitabine resistance. The GC
      receptor (GR) antagonist mifepristone (RU486) counteracted DEX-induced autophagy 
      features, suggesting that the GC-GR complex is involved in the induction of
      autophagy. The autophagy-related miR-378i and miR-378a-3p were selected as the
      top upregulated candidates, and their high expression in PDAC patient tissue
      correlated with low survival. siRNA-mediated downregulation of miR-378 inhibited 
      DEX-induced autophagy, and tumor progression. Bioinformatics confirmed the
      contribution of miR-378 to the regulation of signaling networks involved in
      GC-induced autophagy and tumor progression. The construction of a molecular
      docking model revealed stable binding of miR-378 to the DEX-GR complex,
      suggesting direct regulation. These substantial, novel, in-depth data reveal that
      GCs favor autophagy-mediated cancer progression by inducing miR-378 and GR
      binding and implicate GR and miR-378 as new therapeutic targets.

LID - 5785
AB  - The study assessed chronic myocardial, coronary and systemic effects of
      intracoronary supersaturated oxygen (SSO2) therapy. Left anterior descending
      coronary arteries of 40 swine were stented and randomized to 90-min selective
      intracoronary infusion of SSO2 (pO2 760–1000 mmHg) or normoxemic saline. In 20
      out of 40 animals, SSO2 delivery followed a 60-min balloon occlusion to induce
      myocardial infarction (MI). In both normal and MI models, intracoronary treatment
      with hyperoxemic SSO2 therapy showed no evidence of coronary thrombosis. There
      were no biologically relevant differences between treatments at either time point
      in regard to coronary intervention site healing and neointimal growth. No signs
      of any myocardial or systemic toxicity were observed after 7 or 30 days. A trend 
      was observed toward reduced incidence of microscopic MI scars and reduced infarct
      size in histopathology, as well as toward better recovery of
      echocardiographically evaluated global and regional contractility at 30 days. No 
      treatment related infarcts or thromboemboli were observed in the downstream
      organs.

TI  - Rapid qualitative analysis in a mixed-methods evaluation of an infection
      prevention intervention in a UK hospital setting during the COVID-19 pandemic: A 
      discussion of the CLEAN study methodology.
LID - 958250
AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic created an urgent need for high-quality rapid research. One
      clinical challenge was how to minimise the risk of transmission in the hospital
      setting. The CLEAN study conducted a rapid evaluation of the potential utility of
      a spray-based disinfectant in a hospital setting. The study was undertaken
      between December 2020 and March 2021 and involved the implementation of the spray
      in 10 different clinical areas in one UK teaching hospital. A mixed-methods
      approach was adopted (including observations, surveys, and qualitative
      interviews) informed by the theories for understanding the implementation of new 
      healthcare technologies. The evaluation found that while the spray had a number
      of perceived benefits when added to existing disinfection processes, other
      factors limited its potential utility. These findings informed a number of
      recommendations for future adoption within hospital settings. This paper
      describes and reflects on the rapid methodology that allowed us to undertake the 
      study and deliver results in a short space of time. We experienced a number of
      pressures during set-up and fieldwork due to the challenging conditions caused by
      the pandemic, and the methodological approach had to evolve throughout the study 
      because of the changing clinical context. The involvement of clinicians from the 
      research setting as full members of the research team was key to the rapid
      delivery of the research. They provided an essential link to the implementation
      environment, and their experiential knowledge of the setting added an important
      perspective to the analysis. Balancing their involvement with their clinical
      roles was challenging, however, as was coordinating a large and diverse team of
      interviewers in such a short space of time. Overall, the study highlighted the
      value of rapid research to inform urgent healthcare decisions in a pandemic.
      Although our experience suggests that conducting such research requires some
      practical and methodological trade-offs, we found that there were also numerous
      benefits of using rapid methods and identified various opportunities to ensure
      their robustness.

TI  - Recent Advances in Nanomaterials for Diagnosis, Treatments, and Neurorestoration 
      in Ischemic Stroke.
LID - 885190
AB  - Stroke is a major public health issue, corresponding to the second cause of
      mortality and the first cause of severe disability. Ischemic stroke is the most
      common type of stroke, accounting for 87% of all strokes, where early detection
      and clinical intervention are well known to decrease its morbidity and mortality.
      However, the diagnosis of ischemic stroke has been limited to the late stages,
      and its therapeutic window is too narrow to provide rational and effective
      treatment. In addition, clinical thrombolytics suffer from a short half-life,
      inactivation, allergic reactions, and non-specific tissue targeting. Another
      problem is the limited ability of current neuroprotective agents to promote
      recovery of the ischemic brain tissue after stroke, which contributes to the
      progressive and irreversible nature of ischemic stroke and also the severity of
      the outcome. Fortunately, because of biomaterials’ inherent biochemical and
      biophysical properties, including biocompatibility, biodegradability,
      renewability, nontoxicity, long blood circulation time, and targeting ability.
      Utilization of them has been pursued as an innovative and promising strategy to
      tackle these challenges. In this review, special emphasis will be placed on the
      recent advances in the study of nanomaterials for the diagnosis and therapy of
      ischemic stroke. Meanwhile, nanomaterials provide much promise for neural tissue 
      salvage and regeneration in brain ischemia, which is also highlighted.

      Prevention and Treatment.
LID - 2203291
AB  - Due to the continuous rise in biofilm‐related infections, biofilms seriously
      threaten human health. The formation of biofilms makes conventional antibiotics
      ineffective and dampens immune clearance. Therefore, it is important to
      understand the mechanisms of biofilm formation and develop novel strategies to
      treat biofilms more effectively. This review article begins with an introduction 
      to biofilm formation in various clinical scenarios and their corresponding
      therapy. Established biofilm models used in research are then summarized. The
      potential targets which may assist in the development of new strategies for
      combating biofilms are further discussed. The novel technologies developed
      recently for the prevention and treatment of biofilms including antimicrobial
      surface coatings, physical removal of biofilms, development of new antimicrobial 
      molecules, and delivery of antimicrobial agents are subsequently presented.
      Finally, directions for future studies are pointed out.

TI  - Transcatheter Device Therapy and the Integration of Advanced Imaging in
      Congenital Heart Disease.
LID - 497
AB  - Transcatheter device intervention is now offered as first line therapy for many
      congenital heart defects (CHD) which were traditionally treated with cardiac
      surgery. While off-label use of devices is common and appropriate, a growing
      number of devices are now specifically designed and approved for use in CHD.
      Advanced imaging is now an integral part of interventional procedures including
      pre-procedure planning, intra-procedural guidance, and post-procedure monitoring.
      There is robust societal and industrial support for research and development of
      CHD-specific devices, and the regulatory framework at the national and
      international level is patient friendly. It is against this backdrop that we
      review transcatheter implantable devices for CHD, the role and integration of
      advanced imaging, and explore the current regulatory framework for device
      approval.

TI  - Structural Elucidation of Rift Valley Fever Virus L Protein towards the Discovery
      of Its Potential Inhibitors.
LID - 659
AB  - Rift valley fever virus (RVFV) is the causative agent of a viral zoonosis that
      causes a significant clinical burden in domestic and wild ruminants. Major
      outbreaks of the virus occur in livestock, and contaminated animal products or
      arthropod vectors can transmit the virus to humans. The viral RNA-dependent RNA
      polymerase (RdRp; L protein) of the RVFV is responsible for viral replication and
      is thus an appealing drug target because no effective and specific vaccine
      against this virus is available. The current study reported the structural
      elucidation of the RVFV-L protein by in-depth homology modeling since no crystal 
      structure is available yet. The inhibitory binding modes of known potent L
      protein inhibitors were analyzed. Based on the results, further molecular
      docking-based virtual screening of Selleckchem Nucleoside Analogue Library (156
      compounds) was performed to find potential new inhibitors against the RVFV L
      protein. ADME (Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, and Excretion) and toxicity 
      analysis of these compounds was also performed. Besides, the binding mechanism
      and stability of identified compounds were confirmed by a 50 ns molecular dynamic
      (MD) simulation followed by MM/PBSA binding free energy calculations. Homology
      modeling determined a stable multi-domain structure of L protein. An analysis of 
      known L protein inhibitors, including Monensin, Mycophenolic acid, and Ribavirin,
      provide insights into the binding mechanism and reveals key residues of the L
      protein binding pocket. The screening results revealed that the top three
      compounds, A-317491, Khasianine, and VER155008, exhibited a high affinity at the 
      L protein binding pocket. ADME analysis revealed good pharmacodynamics and
      pharmacokinetic profiles of these compounds. Furthermore, MD simulation and
      binding free energy analysis endorsed the binding stability of potential
      compounds with L protein. In a nutshell, the present study determined potential
      compounds that may aid in the rational design of novel inhibitors of the RVFV L
      protein as anti-RVFV drugs.

TI  - Enhanced electrical conductivity and stretchability of ionic-liquid PEDOT:PSS
      air-cathodes for aluminium-air batteries with long lifetime and high specific
      energy.
LID - 22107
AB  - A hydrogel film, poly-3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene (PEDOT):polystyrenesulfonate
      (PSS), containing an ionic liquid, is used as an air–cathode for a metal-air
      battery and its performance is investigated. This work presents the development
      of the air–cathode and the characterization of its physical, chemical and
      mechanical properties. Moreover, in view of wearable batteries, these
      air-cathodes are implemented within a flexible aluminium-air battery. It contains
      an aluminium anode, an electrolyte made of cellulose paper imbibed with an
      aqueous sodium chloride solution and the PEDOT:PSS air–cathode. Characterisation 
      tests showed that the ionic liquid did not change the air–cathode chemically,
      while the electric conductivity increased considerably. The anode has an
      acceptable purity and was found to be resistant against self-corrosion. Discharge
      tests showed operating voltages up to 0.65 V, whereas two batteries in series
      could deliver up to 1.3 V at a current density of 0.9 mA cm−2 for almost a day,
      sufficient for monitoring and medical devices. Several discharge tests with
      current densities from 0.25 up to 2.5 mA cm−2 have presented operating lifetimes 
      from 10 h up until over a day. At a current density of 2.8 mA cm−2, the operating
      voltage and lifetime dropped considerably, explained by approaching the limiting 
      current density of about 3 mA cm−2, as evidenced by linear sweep voltammetry. The
      batteries showed high specific energies up to about 3140 Wh kg−1. Mechanical
      tests revealed a sufficient stretchability of the air–cathode, even after battery
      discharge, implying an acceptable degree of wearability. Together with the
      reusability of the air–cathode, the battery is a promising route towards a
      low-cost viable way for wearable power supply for monitoring medical devices with
      long lifetimes and high specific energies. Optimization of the air–cathode could 
      even lead to higher power applications.

TI  - Dos and don'ts in large animal models of aortic insufficiency.
LID - 949410
AB  - Aortic insufficiency caused by paravalvular leakage (PVL) is one of the most
      feared complications following transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVI) in
      patients. Domestic pigs (Sus scrofa domestica) are a popular large animal model
      to study such conditions and develop novel diagnostic and therapeutic techniques.
      However, the models based on prosthetic valve implantation are time intensive,
      costly, and often hamper further hemodynamic measurements such as PV loop and 4D 
      MRI flow by causing implantation-related wall motion abnormalities and
      degradation of MR image quality. This study describes in detail, the
      establishment of a minimally invasive porcine model suitable to study the effects
      of mild-to-moderate “paravalvular“ aortic regurgitation on left ventricular (LV) 
      performance and blood flow patterns, particularly under the influence of altered 
      afterload, preload, inotropic state, and heart rate. Six domestic pigs (Swiss
      large white, female, 60–70 kg of body weight) were used to establish this model. 
      The defects on the hinge point of aortic leaflets and annulus were created
      percutaneously by the pierce-and-dilate technique either in the right coronary
      cusp (RCC) or in the non-coronary cusp (NCC). The hemodynamic changes as well as 
      LV performance were recorded by PV loop measurements, while blood flow patterns
      were assessed by 4D MRI. LV performance was additionally challenged by
      pharmaceutically altering cardiac inotropy, chronotropy, and afterload. The
      presented work aims to elaborate the dos and don'ts in porcine models of aortic
      insufficiency and intends to steepen the learning curve for researchers planning 
      to use this or similar models by giving valuable insights ranging from animal
      selection to vascular access choices, placement of PV Loop catheter, improvement 
      of PV loop data acquisition and post-processing and finally the induction of
      paravalvular regurgitation of the aortic valve by a standardized and reproducible
      balloon induced defect in a precisely targeted region of the aortic valve.

TI  - Dynamic Metabolic Changes During Prolonged Ex Situ Heart Perfusion Are Associated
      With Myocardial Functional Decline.
LID - 859506
AB  - Ex situ heart perfusion (ESHP) was developed to preserve and evaluate donated
      hearts in a perfused beating state. However, myocardial function declines during 
      ESHP, which limits the duration of perfusion and the potential to expand the
      donor pool. In this research, we combine a novel, minimally-invasive sampling
      approach with comparative global metabolite profiling to evaluate changes in the 
      metabolomic patterns associated with declines in myocardial function during ESHP.
      Biocompatible solid-phase microextraction (SPME) microprobes serving as chemical 
      biopsy were used to sample heart tissue and perfusate in a translational porcine 
      ESHP model and a small cohort of clinical cases. In addition, six core-needle
      biopsies of the left ventricular wall were collected to compare the performance
      of our SPME sampling method against that of traditional tissue-collection. Our
      state-of-the-art metabolomics platform allowed us to identify a large number of
      significantly altered metabolites and lipid species that presented comparable
      profile of alterations to conventional biopsies. However, significant
      discrepancies in the pool of identified analytes using two sampling methods (SPME
      vs. biopsy) were also identified concerning mainly compounds susceptible to
      dynamic biotransformation and most likely being a result of low-invasive nature
      of SPME. Overall, our results revealed striking metabolic alterations during
      prolonged 8h-ESHP associated with uncontrolled inflammation not counterbalanced
      by resolution, endothelial injury, accelerated mitochondrial oxidative stress,
      the disruption of mitochondrial bioenergetics, and the accumulation of harmful
      lipid species. In conclusion, the combination of perfusion parameters and
      metabolomics can uncover various mechanisms of organ injury and recovery, which
      can help differentiate between donor hearts that are transplantable from those
      that should be discarded.

TI  - An arrayed genome‐wide perturbation screen identifies the ribonucleoprotein
      Hnrnpk as rate‐limiting for prion propagation.
LID - e112338
AB  - A defining characteristic of mammalian prions is their capacity for
      self‐sustained propagation. Theoretical considerations and experimental evidence 
      suggest that prion propagation is modulated by cell‐autonomous and non‐autonomous
      modifiers. Using a novel quantitative phospholipase protection assay (QUIPPER)
      for high‐throughput prion measurements, we performed an arrayed genome‐wide RNA
      interference (RNAi) screen aimed at detecting cellular host‐factors that can
      modify prion propagation. We exposed prion‐infected cells in high‐density
      microplates to 35,364 ternary pools of 52,746 siRNAs targeting 17,582 genes
      representing the majority of the mouse protein‐coding transcriptome. We
      identified 1,191 modulators of prion propagation. While 1,151 modified the
      expression of both the pathological prion protein, PrPSc, and its cellular
      counterpart, PrPC, 40 genes selectively affected PrPSc. Of the latter 40 genes,
      20 augmented prion production when suppressed. A prominent limiter of prion
      propagation was the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein Hnrnpk. Psammaplysene
      A (PSA), which binds Hnrnpk, reduced prion levels in cultured cells and protected
      them from cytotoxicity. PSA also reduced prion levels in infected cerebellar
      organotypic slices and alleviated locomotor deficits in prion‐infected Drosophila
      melanogaster expressing ovine PrPC. Hence, genome‐wide QUIPPER‐based
      perturbations can discover actionable cellular pathways involved in prion
      propagation. Further, the unexpected identification of a prion‐controlling
      ribonucleoprotein suggests a role for RNA in the generation of infectious prions.

TI  - A Pilot Trial to Compare the Long-Term Efficacy of Pulmonary Vein Isolation with 
      High-Power Short-Duration Radiofrequency Versus Laser Energy with Rapid Ablation 
      Mode.
LID - 98
AB  - Background: Pulmonary vein (PV) reconnection is the major cause of atrial
      fibrillation (AF) recurrence after pulmonary vein isolation (PVI). The
      probability of reconnection is higher if the primary lesion is not sufficiently
      effective, which can be unmasked with an adenosine provocation test (APT).
      High-power short-duration radiofrequency energy (HPSD) guided with ablation index
      (AI) and the third generation of the visually guided laser balloon (VGLB) are new
      methods for PVI. Methods: A total of 70 participants (35 in each group) who
      underwent a PVI with either AI-guided HPSD (50 W; AI 500 for the anterior and 400
      for the posterior wall, respectively) or VGLB ablation were included in this
      observational pilot trial. Twenty minutes after each PVI, an APT was performed.
      The primary endpoint was the event-free survival from AF after three years.
      Results: A total of 137 (100%) PVs in the HPSD arm and 131 PVs (98.5%) in the
      VGLB arm were initially successfully isolated (p = 0.24). The overall procedure
      duration was similar in both arms (155 ± 39 in HPSD vs. 175 ± 58 min in VGLB, p =
      0.191). Fluoroscopy time, left atrial dwelling time and duration from the first
      to the last ablation were longer in the VGLB arm (23 ± 8 vs. 12 ± 3 min, p <
      0.001; 157 (111–185) vs. 134 (104–154) min, p = 0.049; 92(59–108) vs. 72 (43–85) 
      min, p = 0.010). A total of 127 (93%) in the HPSD arm and 126 (95%) PVs in the
      VGLB arm remained isolated after APT (p = 0.34). The primary endpoint was met
      1107 ± 68 days after ablation in 71% vs. 66% in the VGLB and HPSD arms,
      respectively (p = 0.65). Conclusions: HPSD and VGLB did not differ with respect
      to long-term outcome of PVI. A large, randomized study should be conducted to
      compare clinical outcomes with respect to these new ablation techniques.

TI  - Echocardiographic Determination of Percutaneous Central Venous Catheters in the
      Superior Vena Cava: A Prospective Cohort Study.
LID - 624
AB  - Malposition of percutaneous central venous catheters (PCVCs) in the superior vena
      cava (SVC) is common. We previously showed that real-time sonography was safer
      and faster than radiography in identifying PCVC tip location in the inferior vena
      cava (IVC). However, in preterm infants, determining PCVC tip location in the SVC
      is complicated by endotracheal or nasogastric tubes in situ and emphysematous
      lung conditions. We aimed to find an appropriate sonographic view by which to
      assess PCVC tip location in the SVC compared to the sonographic examination of
      PCVC in the IVC. Neonates (n = 50) with PCVCs in the SVC were enrolled and their 
      data (gestational age, gender, birth weight, body weight at intervention,
      repositioning rate, and duration of tip assessment) were compared with
      retrospective data of 50 neonates with PCVCs in the IVC. The mean gestational age
      in the groups of IVC and SVC was 31.43 weeks and 32.16 weeks, respectively. The
      mean birth weight in the groups of IVC and SVC was 1642.18 g and 1792.00 g,
      respectively. Placement of an S12-4 ultrasound sector transducer to obtain clear 
      parasternal views of the aorta allows visualization of PCVC tips in the SVC and
      near the cavoatrial junction. PCVC repositioning rates were not significantly
      different between the two groups (p = 0.092). Sonography examinations in the SVC 
      had a longer duration than those in the IVC (p < 0.001). Sonography provides an
      accurate method for determining PCVC tip location in the SVC.

TI  - Role of Transcatheter Arterial Embolization in Acute Refractory Non-variceal
      Upper Gastrointestinal Bleeding Not Controlled by Endoscopy: A Single-Center
      Experience and a Literature Review.
LID - e29962
AB  - IntroductionAcute upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) is a medical emergency
      and a common cause of hospital admissions worldwide. It has traditionally been
      treated with resuscitation and endoscopic intervention as the first-line therapy.
      In this study, we assessed the adjunctive role of transcatheter arterial
      embolization (TAE) in patients with uncontrolled UGIB after an endoscopic
      intervention.Material and methodsA retrospective chart review of patients
      requiring TAE of UGIB which was not controlled by endoscopic intervention in
      BronxCare Health System from 2018 to 2021 was done. Patients who were more than
      18 years of age and required TAE during the time period of the study were
      included in the study. Patients' charts were reviewed for patients' demographics,
      comorbidities, hospital course, imaging findings, esophagogastroduodenoscopy
      findings and intervention, and interventional radiology intervention and clinical
      outcome.ResultsA total of 10 patients were included in the study. A majority of
      the patients were male. Transcatheter atrial embolization was successful in all
      the 10 patients. Coils were used in seven patients while particulate polyvinyl
      alcohol 500 micron particle was used in two patients and vascular plug was used
      in two patients. Out of the 10 patients, four expired during the hospital course.
      None of the patients died secondary to UGIB. Three of the patients expired due to
      severe sepsis with septic shock secondary to pneumonia while one patient died
      because of respiratory failure due to lung collapse secondary to endobronchial
      lesion.ConclusionRefractory acute UGIB is associated with significant morbidity
      and mortality. TAE is a minimally invasive measure that should be considered
      early in the treatment of UGIB which is refractory to conventional endoscopic
      management. Our case highlights the importance of TAE in a patient with
      refractory UGIB after endoscopic intervention.

TI  - A Simplified Approach to Pulmonary Vein Visualization during Cryoballoon Ablation
      of Atrial Fibrillation.
LID - 1700
AB  - Background and Objectives: Selective pulmonary vein (PV) angiography has been
      established as the gold standard for PV visualization in cryoballoon (CB)-based
      pulmonary vein isolation (PVI). We sought to simplify this approach to reduce
      procedural complexity and radiation exposure. Materials and Methods: Patients
      with paroxysmal and recently diagnosed persistent AF undergoing CB-based PVI from
      January 2015 to December 2017 were retrospectively analyzed. Patients underwent
      either selective PV angiography or conventional left atrial (LA) angiography for 
      PV visualization. Results: A total of 336 patients were analyzed. A total of 87
      patients (26%) received PV angiography and 249 (74%) LA angiography. LA
      angiography required fewer cine-sequences for PV visualization, translating into 
      a significant reduction in procedure duration, fluoroscopy time and dose area
      product. Additionally, less contrast medium was utilized. PV occlusion by the CB,
      CB temperature and time to isolation showed no significant differences. The
      number of CB applications and total application time (LA angiography: 1.4 ± 0.02 
      vs. PV Angiography: 1.6 ± 0.05; p < 0.0001; LA angiography: 297.9 ± 4.62 vs.
      PV-Angiography: 348.9 ± 11.03; p < 0.001, respectively) per vein were slightly
      but significantly higher in the PV angiography group. We observed no difference
      in late AF recurrence (24.7% LA angiography vs. 21.3% PV angiography; p =
      0.2657). Conclusions: A simplified protocol, using LA angiography for PV
      visualization, entails a reduction in procedure time and radiation exposure while
      equally maintaining procedural efficiency and safety in both groups.

TI  - Estimating the Similarity between Protein Pockets.
LID - 12462
AB  - With the exponential increase in publicly available protein structures, the
      comparison of protein binding sites naturally emerged as a scientific topic to
      explain observations or generate hypotheses for ligand design, notably to predict
      ligand selectivity for on- and off-targets, explain polypharmacology, and design 
      target-focused libraries. The current review summarizes the state-of-the-art
      computational methods applied to pocket detection and comparison as well as
      structural druggability estimates. The major strengths and weaknesses of current 
      pocket descriptors, alignment methods, and similarity search algorithms are
      presented. Lastly, an exhaustive survey of both retrospective and prospective
      applications in diverse medicinal chemistry scenarios illustrates the capability 
      of the existing methods and the hurdle that still needs to be overcome for more
      accurate predictions.

TI  - Implications of Transglutaminase-Mediated Protein Serotonylation in the
      Epigenetic Landscape, Small Cell Lung Cancer, and Beyond.
LID - 1332
AB  - Simple Summary: From the landmark report of protein serotonylation on small
      GTPases in 2003 to the most recent discovery of serotonin-modified histone H3
      leading to epigenetic changes, over the course of the past 20 years, there is
      still a cloud of mystery surrounding this rare post-translational modification,
      other than the fact that tissue transglutaminase, perhaps most famously known for
      its role in celiac disease, is the enzyme responsible for catalyzing this
      transamidation reaction. This review seeks to interpret the role of protein
      serotonylation in transcriptional regulation through some of the mechanistic and 
      intertwining details of the modification, its potential modulation of the
      epigenetic landscape, as well as potential implications in lung and other types
      of cancer. Abstract: In the case of small-cell lung carcinoma, the highly
      metastatic nature of the disease and the propensity for several chromatin
      modifiers to harbor mutations suggest that epigenetic manipulation may also be a 
      promising route for oncotherapy, but histone deacetylase inhibitors on their own 
      do not appear to be particularly effective, suggesting that there may be other
      regulatory parameters that dictate the effectiveness of vorinostat’s reversal of 
      histone deacetylation. Recent discoveries that serotonylation of histone H3
      alters the permissibility of gene expression have led to renewed attention to
      this rare modification, as facilitated by transglutaminase 2, and at the same
      time introduce new questions about whether this modification belongs to a part of
      the concerted cohort of regulator events for modulating the epigenetic landscape.
      This review explores the mechanistic details behind protein serotonylation and
      its possible connections to the epigenome via histone modifications and glycan
      interactions and attempts to elucidate the role of transglutaminase 2, such that 
      optimizations to existing histone deacetylase inhibitor designs or combination
      therapies may be devised for lung and other types of cancer.

TI  - Think outside the box: a case report of utilization of an excimer laser sheath as
      an intracardiac bioptome.
LID - ytad107
AB  - Background: Malignant cardiac tumours are rare entities that cause severe
      morbidity and mortality. Possible treatment options vary between surgical
      removement, (immuno-) chemotherapy, and palliative care, whilst diagnostic workup
      comprises of imaging and histopathology analysis. Excimer laser sheaths are a new
      possibility to extract significant tissue samples to offer adequate treatment.
      Case summary: A 67-year-old Caucasian female presented with progressive shortness
      of breath, new onset of fevers, weight loss, and recurrent night sweats. She
      showed signs of upper venous stasis.Cardiac imaging revealed an obstructive,
      hypoperfused right atrial mass superior to the tricuspid valve and a sessile
      structure at the mitral valve. Guideline-directed therapy for endocarditis was
      started subsequently.A conventional intracardiac biopsy of the tumour was
      unsuccessful, but an off-label approach using an excimer laser sheath as bioptome
      leads to the diagnosis of a diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Immuno-chemotherapy
      was commenced, leading to reduction in tumour size and rapid improvement in the
      quality of life. Discussion: Intracardiac biopsies are an important piece of the 
      puzzle in the diagnostic workup of cardiac neoplasms. This case report is the
      first description of the utilization of a laser lead extraction tool as a
      bioptome for intracardiac tumours. Two imaging modalities (echocardiogram,
      fluoroscopy), as well as the precise technique of the excimer laser, ensured
      safety for the patient. Clinical studies are paramount to further evaluate the
      laser sheath as a possible new instrument in the toolbox of an interventional
      cardiologist.

TI  - The Role of Cocaine- and Amphetamine-Regulated Transcript (CART) in Cancer: A
      Systematic Review.
LID - 9986
AB  - The functions of cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript (CART)
      neuropeptide encoded by the CARTPT gene vary from modifying behavior and pain
      sensitivity to being an antioxidant. Putative CART peptide receptor GPR160 was
      implicated recently in the pathogenesis of cancer. However, the exact role of
      CART protein in the development of neoplasms remains unclear. This systematic
      review includes articles retrieved from the Scopus, PubMed, Web of Science and
      Medline Complete databases. Nineteen publications that met the inclusion criteria
      and describe the association of CART and cancer were analyzed. CART is expressed 
      in various types of cancer, e.g., in breast cancer and neuroendocrine tumors
      (NETs). The role of CART as a potential biomarker in breast cancer, stomach
      adenocarcinoma, glioma and some types of NETs was suggested. In various cancer
      cell lines, CARTPT acts an oncogene, enhancing cellular survival by the
      activation of the ERK pathway, the stimulation of other pro-survival molecules,
      the inhibition of apoptosis or the increase in cyclin D1 levels. In breast
      cancer, CART was reported to protect tumor cells from tamoxifen-mediated death.
      Taken together, these data support the role of CART activity in the pathogenesis 
      of cancer, thus opening new diagnostic and therapeutic approaches in neoplastic
      disorders.

TI  - Very high-power short-duration ablation for pulmonary vein isolation utilizing a 
      very-close protocol—the FAST AND FURIOUS PVI study.
PG  - 880-8
AB  - Aims: The very high-power short-duration (vHP-SD) radiofrequency (RF) ablation
      concept of atrial fibrillation (AF) treatment by pulmonary vein isolation (PVI)
      aims for safer, more effective, and faster procedures. Utilizing conventional
      ablation, the ‘close protocol’ has been verified. Since lesion formation of
      vHP-SD ablation creates wider but shallower lesions we adapted the close protocol
      to an individualized and tighter ‘very-close protocol’ of 3–4 mm of inter-lesion 
      distance (ILD) at the anterior and 5–6 mm at the posterior aspect of the left
      atrium using vHP-SD only. Here, we evaluated the safety and efficacy of vHP-SD
      ablation for PVI utilizing a very-close protocol in comparison with standard
      ablation. Methods and results: A total of 50 consecutive patients with
      symptomatic AF were treated with a very-close protocol utilizing vHP-SD (vHP-SD
      group). The data were compared with 50 consecutive patients treated by the
      ablation-index-guided strategy (control group). The mean RF time was 352 ± 81 s
      (vHP-SD) and 1657 ± 570 s (control, P < 0.0001), and the mean procedure duration 
      was 59 ± 13 (vHP-SD) and 101 ± 38 (control, P < 0.0001). The first-pass isolation
      rate was 74% (vHP-SD) and 76% (control, P = 0.817). Severe adverse events were
      reported in 1 (2%, vHP-SD) and 3 (6%, control) patients (P = 0.307). A 12-month
      recurrence-free survival was 78% (vHP-SD) and 64% (control, P = 0.142). PVI
      durability assessed during redo-procedures was 75% (vHP-SD) vs. 33% (control, P <
      0.001). Conclusions: PVI solely utilizing vHP-SD via a very-close protocol
      provides safe and effective procedures with a high rate of first-pass isolations.
      The procedure duration and ablation time were remarkably low. A 12-month
      follow-up and PVI durability are promising.

TI  - Alternative Means of Informed Consent in Cardiology: Strategies and Effectiveness
      in a Group of Italian Patients.
LID - 430
AB  - Informed consent practices in healthcare represent a fundamental element of
      patient-centred care; however, the traditional use of a written, paper-based
      description of the medical procedure to obtain informed consent presents many
      limitations. This research aimed to evaluate the effects of an alternative
      modality of obtaining informed consent using a brief informative video for
      patients waiting to undergo a coronary angiography procedure in Italy. The study 
      involved 40 participants—28 males and 12 females (mean age: 68.55, SD =
      13.03)—divided equally into two groups: one group received the video-based
      informed consent and the other received a traditional paper-based form. Each
      group was asked to fill in two questionnaires; one was created by the researchers
      to measure the patient’s level of understanding of the given information and the 
      perception of usefulness of the informed consent, and the other was the
      Depression Anxiety Stress Scales-21 (DASS-21), which evaluates levels of anxiety,
      depression and stress. A comparison of the results of the two groups showed that 
      video-based informed consent allowed participants to better understand the given 
      information, to feel more confident concerning their subjective comprehension of 
      it and to perceive the video-based informed consent as more useful than the
      traditional one. The video-based informed consent did not lead to higher levels
      of anxiety, depression or stress among the participants. It can be hypothesized
      that video-based formats may represent a more useful, understandable and safe
      alternative to traditional paper-based informed consent in healthcare.

TI  - Ligand-Enhanced Negative Images Optimized for Docking Rescoring.
LID - 7871
AB  - Despite the pivotal role of molecular docking in modern drug discovery, the
      default docking scoring functions often fail to recognize active ligands in
      virtual screening campaigns. Negative image-based rescoring improves docking
      enrichment by comparing the shape/electrostatic potential (ESP) of the flexible
      docking poses against the target protein’s inverted cavity volume. By optimizing 
      these negative image-based (NIB) models using a greedy search, the docking
      rescoring yield can be improved massively and consistently. Here, a fundamental
      modification is implemented to this shape-focused pharmacophore modelling
      approach—actual ligand 3D coordinates are incorporated into the NIB models for
      the optimization. This hybrid approach, labelled as ligand-enhanced brute-force
      negative image-based optimization (LBR-NiB), takes the best from both worlds,
      i.e., the all-roundedness of the NIB models and the difficult to emulate atomic
      arrangements of actual protein-bound small-molecule ligands. Thorough
      benchmarking, focused on proinflammatory targets, shows that the LBR-NiB
      routinely improves the docking enrichment over prior iterations of the R-NiB
      methodology. This boost can be massive, if the added ligand information provides 
      truly essential binding information that was lacking or completely missing from
      the cavity-based NIB model. On a practical level, the results indicate that the
      LBR-NiB typically works well when the added ligand 3D data originates from a
      high-quality source, such as X-ray crystallography, and, yet, the NIB model
      compositions can also sometimes be improved by fusing into them, for example,
      with flexibly docked solvent molecules. In short, the study demonstrates that the
      protein-bound ligands can be used to improve the shape/ESP features of the
      negative images for effective docking rescoring use in virtual screening.

TI  - Lactoferricins impair the cytosolic membrane of Escherichia coli within a few
      seconds and accumulate inside the cell.
LID - e72850
AB  - We report the real-time response of Escherichia coli to lactoferricin-derived
      antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) on length scales bridging microscopic cell sizes to
      nanoscopic lipid packing using millisecond time-resolved synchrotron small-angle 
      X-ray scattering. Coupling a multiscale scattering data analysis to biophysical
      assays for peptide partitioning revealed that the AMPs rapidly permeabilize the
      cytosolic membrane within less than 3 s—much faster than previously considered.
      Final intracellular AMP concentrations of ∼80–100 mM suggest an efficient
      obstruction of physiologically important processes as the primary cause of
      bacterial killing. On the other hand, damage of the cell envelope and leakage
      occurred also at sublethal peptide concentrations, thus emerging as a collateral 
      effect of AMP activity that does not kill the bacteria. This implies that the
      impairment of the membrane barrier is a necessary but not sufficient condition
      for microbial killing by lactoferricins. The most efficient AMP studied exceeds
      others in both speed of permeabilizing membranes and lowest intracellular peptide
      concentration needed to inhibit bacterial growth.

TI  - Quantitative aortography for assessment of aortic regurgitation in the era of
      percutaneous aortic valve replacement.
LID - 1161779
AB  - Paravalvular leak (PVL) is a shortcoming that can erode the clinical benefits of 
      transcatheter valve replacement (TAVR) and therefore a readily applicable method 
      (aortography) to quantitate PVL objectively and accurately in the interventional 
      suite is appealing to all operators. The ratio between the areas of the
      time-density curves in the aorta and left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT-AR)
      defines the regurgitation fraction (RF). This technique has been validated in a
      mock circulation; a single injection in diastole was further tested in porcine
      and ovine models. In the clinical setting, LVOT-AR was compared with
      trans-thoracic and trans-oesophageal echocardiography and cardiac magnetic
      resonance imaging. LVOT-AR > 17% discriminates mild from moderate aortic
      regurgitation on echocardiography and confers a poor prognosis in multiple
      registries, and justifies balloon post-dilatation. The LVOT-AR differentiates the
      individual performances of many old and novel devices and is being used in
      ongoing randomized trials and registries.

TI  - Parenchymal border macrophages regulate CSF flow dynamics.
PG  - 585-93
AB  - Macrophages are important players for the maintenance of tissue homeostasis1.
      Perivascular and leptomeningeal macrophages reside in close proximity to the
      central nervous system (CNS) parenchyma2, and their role in CNS physiology has
      not been well enough studied to date. Given their continuous interaction with the
      cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and strategic positioning, we refer to these cells
      collectively as parenchymal border macrophages (PBMs). Here, we demonstrate that 
      PBMs regulate CSF flow dynamics. We identify a subpopulation of PBMs expressing
      high levels of CD163 and Lyve1 (scavenger receptor proteins), located in close
      proximity to the brain arterial tree, and show that Lyve1+ PBMs regulate arterial
      motion that drives CSF flow. Pharmacological or genetic depletion of PBMs led to 
      accumulation of extracellular matrix proteins, obstructing CSF access to
      perivascular spaces hence impairing CNS perfusion and clearance. Aging-associated
      alterations in PBMs and impairment of CSF dynamics were restored upon
      intracisternal injection of macrophage colony-stimulating growth factor (M-CSF). 
      Human single-nuclei RNA sequencing data obtained from Alzheimer’s disease (AD)
      patients and healthy controls point to changes in phagocytosis/endocytosis and
      interferon-gamma (IFNγ) signaling on PBMs, pathways that are corroborated in a
      mouse AD model. Collectively, our results identify PBMs as novel cellular
      regulators of CSF flow dynamics, which could potentially be targeted
      pharmacologically to alleviate brain clearance deficits associated with aging and
      AD.

      locus coeruleus.
LID - e2222095120
AB  - The locus coeruleus (LC) is the main source of norepinephrine (NE) in the brain, 
      modulates wakefulness, and is altered in stress-related disorders. NE neurons
      express neuropeptides as cotransmitters, including galanin. Here, we combine
      single-cell-RNA-sequencing, neuroanatomy, and electrophysiology to build a map of
      galanin and its receptors in the mouse LC. We found that NE neurons express mRNA 
      transcripts for galanin, >19 other neuropeptides (but Npy), and >30 neuropeptide 
      receptors with Galr1 included at low levels. Selective activation of GalR1
      inhibited the spontaneous activity of a subset of NE neurons possibly through the
      activation of Kv currents. Taken together, these data provide insights into the
      role of neuropeptide expression and signaling in the mouse LC.

TI  - Pulmonary vein isolation for atrial fibrillation using true high-power
      short-duration vs. cryoballoon ablation.
PG  - 846-52
AB  - Aims: Pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) is achievable and effective using
      radiofrequency (RF) catheter (CA) or cryoballoon (CB) ablation. The newly
      introduced high RF-power short-duration ablation (HPSD) technique has shown
      promising results. Data comparing HPSD- to CB-PVI is sparse. We sought to
      investigate success rates and procedural differences of HPSD-PVI vs. CB-PVI in
      patients undergoing ablation for PAF and persAF. Methods: Consecutive patients
      undergoing de novo PVI (HPSD or CB) were included. A power setting of 70W/7 s
      (70W/5 s at posterior wall) using a flexible tip catheter with enhanced
      irrigation was considered as true HPSD. Follow-up consisted of out-clinic pts
      visits, tele-consultation, 48-h Holter ECG, app-based telemonitoring and cardiac 
      implanted electronic devices (CIED) interrogation. Results: 721 patients (46
      HPSD, 675 CB) were analyzed. In all HPSD (27 persAF [59%]) and CB patients (423
      persAF [63%]), PVI was successfully achieved. Procedure duration was
      significantly longer for HPSD (91 ± 19 min vs. 72 ± 18 min, p < 0.01). Ablation
      time was similar in both groups (HPSD: 44 ± 19 min vs. CB: 40 ± 17 min;
      p = 0.347). No major complications occurred in HPSD. For CB-PVI, in 25 (3.7%;
      p = 0.296) patients, complications occurred. At a follow-up of 290 ± 135 days,
      arrhythmia-free survival using HPSD was non-inferior to CB-PVI in the
      Kaplan–Meier survival analysis (p = 0.096). Conclusion: PVI using HPSD is equally
      effective and safe to CB-PVI. This analysis revealed a similar arrhythmia-free
      survival after HPSD and CB with low complication rates. Procedure duration for CB
      was significantly shorter while LA dwell time excluding mapping was equal.
      Currently, a prospective trial is conducted to corroborate these findings.

TI  - Flow-Based Fmoc-SPPS Preparation and SAR Study of Cathelicidin-PY Reveals
      Selective Antimicrobial Activity.
LID - 1993
AB  - Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) hold promise as novel therapeutics in the fight
      against multi-drug-resistant pathogens. Cathelicidin-PY
      (NH2-RKCNFLCKLKEKLRTVITSHIDKVLRPQG-COOH) is a 29-residue disulfide-cyclised
      antimicrobial peptide secreted as an innate host defence mechanism by the frog
      Paa yunnanensis (PY) and reported to possess broad-spectrum antibacterial and
      antifungal properties, exhibiting low cytotoxic and low hemolytic activity.
      Herein, we detail the total synthesis of cathelicidin-PY using an entirely
      on-resin synthesis, including assembly of the linear sequence by rapid flow
      Fmoc-SPPS and iodine-mediated disulfide bridge formation. By optimising a
      synthetic strategy to prepare cathelicidin-PY, this strategy was subsequently
      adapted to prepare a bicyclic head-to-tail cyclised derivative of
      cathelicidin-PY. The structure-activity relationship (SAR) of cathelicidin-PY
      with respect to the N-terminally positioned disulfide was further probed by
      preparing an alanine-substituted linear analogue and a series of lactam-bridged
      peptidomimetics implementing side chain to side chain cyclisation. The analogues 
      were investigated for antimicrobial activity, secondary structure by circular
      dichroism (CD), and stability in human serum. Surprisingly, the disulfide bridge 
      emerged as non-essential to antimicrobial activity and secondary structure but
      was amenable to synthetic modification. Furthermore, the synthetic AMP and
      multiple analogues demonstrated selective activity towards Gram-negative pathogen
      E. coli in physiologically relevant concentrations of divalent cations.

TI  - Novel cryoballoon ablation system for pulmonary vein isolation: multicenter
      assessment of efficacy and safety—ANTARCTICA study.
PG  - 1917-25
AB  - Aims: Pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) either by balloon devices or radiofrequency 
      forms the cornerstone of invasive atrial fibrillation (AF) treatment. Although
      equally effective cryoballoon (CB)-based PVI offers shorter procedure duration
      and a better safety profile. Beside the worldwide established Arctic Front
      Advance system, a novel CB device, POLARx, was recently introduced. This CB
      incorporates unique features, which may translate into improved efficacy and
      safety. However, multicentre assessment of periprocedural efficacy and safety is 
      lacking up to date. Methods and results: A total of 317 patients with paroxysmal 
      or persistent AF were included and underwent POLARx CB-based PVI in 6 centres
      from Germany and Italy. Acute efficacy and safety were assessed in this
      prospective multicenter observational study. In 317 patients [mean age: 64 ± 12
      years, 209 of 317 (66%) paroxysmal AF], a total of 1256 pulmonary veins (PVs)
      were identified and 1252 (99,7%) PVs were successfully isolated utilizing mainly 
      the short tip POLARx CB (82%). The mean minimal CB temperature was −57.9 ± 7°C.
      Real-time PVI was registered in 72% of PVs. The rate of serious adverse events
      was 6.0% which was significantly reduced after a learning curve of 25 cases (9.3%
      vs. 3.0%, P = 0.018). The rate of recurrence-free survival after mean follow-up
      of 226 ± 115 days including a 90-day blanking period was 86.1%. Conclusion: In
      this large multicentre assessment, the novel POLARx CB shows a promising efficacy
      and safety profile after a short learning curve.

TI  - Percutaneous implantation of peripherally inserted totally implantable venous
      access systems in the forearm in adolescent patients.
PG  - 1550-8
AB  - Background: Children with different underlying malignant diseases require
      long-term central venous access. As for port systems in a pectoral position,
      peripherally implanted port systems in the forearm revealed high levels of
      technical and clinical success in adult cohorts. Objective: To investigate the
      technical and clinical outcomes of percutaneous central venous port implantation 
      in the forearm in adolescents. Materials and methods: Between April 2010 and
      August 2020, 32 children ages 9 to 17 years with underlying malignancy received
      35 totally implantable venous access ports (TIVAPs) in the forearm. All venous
      port systems were peripherally inserted under ultrasound guidance. Correct
      catheter placement was controlled by fluoroscopy. As primary endpoints, the
      technical success, rate of complications and catheter maintenance were analyzed. 
      Secondary endpoints were the side of implantation, vein of catheter access,
      laboratory results on the day of the procedure, procedural radiation exposure,
      amount of contrast agent and reasons for port device removal. Results:
      Percutaneous TIVAP placement under sonographic guidance was technically
      successful in 34 of 35 procedures (97.1%). Procedure-related complications did
      not occur. During the follow-up, 13,684 catheter days were analyzed, revealing 11
      complications (0.8 per 1,000 catheter-duration days), Of these 11 complications, 
      7 were major and 10 occurred late. In seven cases, the port device had to be
      removed; removal-related complications did not occur. Conclusion: Peripheral
      TIVAP placement in the forearms of children is a feasible, effective and safe
      technique with good midterm outcome. As results are comparable with standard
      access routes, this technique may be offered as an alternative when intermittent 
      venous access is required.

      epithelial cells from the cytotoxic and proinflammatory effects of human
      cathelicidin in vitro.
LID - 994328
AB  - Human cathelicidin (LL-37) is a defense peptide with antimicrobial activity
      against various pathogens. However, LL-37 can also trigger tissue injury by
      binding to host cell membranes. The cytotoxic effects of LL-37 may be especially 
      relevant in chronic respiratory diseases characterized by increased LL-37. The
      aim of this study was to investigate whether the human collectin SP-A and a
      trimeric recombinant fragment thereof (rfhSP-A) can regulate the activities of
      LL-37. To this end, we studied the interaction of LL-37 with SP-A and rfhSP-A by 
      intrinsic fluorescence, dynamic light scattering, and circular dichroism, as well
      as the effects of these proteins on the antimicrobial and cytotoxic activities of
      LL-37. Both SP-A and rfhSP-A bound LL-37 with high affinity at physiological
      ionic strength (KD = 0.45 ± 0.01 nM for SP-A and 1.22 ± 0.7 nM for rfhSP-A). Such
      interactions result in the reduction of LL-37-induced cell permeability and IL-8 
      release in human pneumocytes, mediated by P2X7 channels. Binding of LL-37 to SP-A
      did not modify the properties of SP-A or the antibacterial activity of LL-37
      against respiratory pathogens (Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and
      nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae). SP-A/LL-37 complexes showed a greater
      ability to aggregate LPS vesicles than LL-37, which reduces endotoxin
      bioactivity. These results reveal the protective role of native SP-A in
      controlling LL-37 activities and suggest a potential therapeutic effect of
      rfhSP-A in reducing the cytotoxic and inflammatory actions of LL-37, without
      affecting its microbicidal activity against Gram-negative pathogens.

TI  - Regulation of cargo exocytosis by a Reps1-Ralbp1-RalA module.
LID - eade2540
AB  - Surface levels of membrane proteins are determined by a dynamic balance between
      exocytosis-mediated surface delivery and endocytosis-dependent retrieval from the
      cell surface. Imbalances in surface protein levels perturb surface protein
      homeostasis and cause major forms of human disease such as type 2 diabetes and
      neurological disorders. Here, we found a Reps1-Ralbp1-RalA module in the exocytic
      pathway broadly regulating surface protein levels. Reps1 and Ralbp1 form a binary
      complex that recognizes RalA, a vesicle-bound small guanosine triphosphatases
      (GTPase) promoting exocytosis through interacting with the exocyst complex. RalA 
      binding results in Reps1 release and formation of a Ralbp1-RalA binary complex.
      Ralbp1 selectively recognizes GTP-bound RalA but is not a RalA effector. Instead,
      Ralbp1 binding maintains RalA in an active GTP-bound state. These studies
      uncovered a segment in the exocytic pathway and, more broadly, revealed a
      previously unrecognized regulatory mechanism for small GTPases, GTP state
      stabilization.

TI  - Pulmonary vein isolation with the radiofrequency balloon catheter: a single
      centre prospective study.
PG  - 896-904
AB  - Aims: The multielectrode radiofrequency balloon catheter (RFB) has been developed
      to achieve safe and effective pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) for atrial
      fibrillation (AF) ablation. This single-centre study aimed to evaluate the
      midterm clinical outcome and predictors of single-shot PVI with the novel RFB.
      Methods and results: All consecutive patients with symptomatic paroxysmal or
      persistent AF undergoing first-time PVI with the RFB were prospectively included.
      Clinical and procedural parameters were systematically collected. The primary
      safety endpoint was defined as any major periprocedural complications. The
      primary efficacy endpoint consisted of freedom from any atrial tachyarrhythmias
      (ATas) lasting >30 s during the follow-up after a 3-month blanking period.
      Persistent single-shot PVI was defined as PVI achieved with a single RFB
      application without acute reconnection. A total of 104 consecutive patients (mean
      age 64.3 ± 11.4 years, 56.7% males) were included. 15 patients (14.4%) presented 
      with persistent AF. The procedure time was 59.0 min with a dwell time of 20.0
      min. One major complication occurred in one patient. At a mean follow-up of 10.1 
      ± 5.3 months, freedom from ATas was 82.9%. ATas occurred in 14 patients, 11/69
      patients (15.9%) with paroxysmal AF and 3/13 (23.1%) with persistent AF. The best
      cut-offs to predict persistent single-shot PVI were impedance drop >19.2 Ω [area 
      under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC) 0.74] and temperature rise
      >11.1° C (AUC 0.77). Conclusion: In a large cohort of patients undergoing PVI
      with the RFB, the complication rate was 1%. At a mid-term follow-up of 10.1 ± 5.3
      months, freedom from ATas was 82.9%. Specific cut-offs of impedance drop and
      temperature rise may be useful to predict persistent single-shot isolation.

TI  - Virtual home-based palliative care during COVID-19: A qualitative exploration of 
      the patient, caregiver, and healthcare provider experience.
PG  - 1374-88
AB  - Background:: Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, many community palliative healthcare
      providers shifted from providing care in a patient’s home to providing almost
      exclusively virtual palliative care, or a combination of in-person and virtual
      care. Research on virtual palliative care is thus needed to provide
      evidence-based recommendations aiming to enhance the delivery of palliative care 
      during and beyond the pandemic. Aim:: To explore the experiences and perceptions 
      of community palliative care providers, patients and caregivers who delivered or 
      received virtual palliative care as a component of home-based palliative care
      during the COVID-19 pandemic. Design:: Qualitative study using phone and
      video-based semi-structured interviews. Data were analyzed using thematic
      analysis. Setting/participants:: A total of 37 participants, including community 
      palliative care patients/caregivers (n = 19) and healthcare providers (n = 18)
      recruited from sites in Ottawa and Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Results:: Overall,
      participants preferred in-person palliative care compared to virtual care, but
      suggested virtual care could be a useful supplement to in-person care. The
      findings are presented in three main themes: (1) Impact of COVID-19 pandemic on
      community palliative care services; (2) Factors influencing transition from
      exclusively virtual model of care back to a blended model of care; and (3)
      Recommended uses and implementation of virtual palliative care Conclusions::
      Incorporating virtual palliative care into healthcare provider practice models
      (blended care models) may be the ideal model of care and standard practice moving
      forward beyond the COVID-19 pandemic, which has important implications toward
      organization and delivery of community palliative care services and funding of
      healthcare providers.

TI  - A soft robotic sleeve mimicking the haemodynamics and biomechanics of left
      ventricular pressure overload and aortic stenosis.
PG  - 1134-47
AB  - Preclinical models of aortic stenosis can induce left ventricular pressure
      overload and coarsely control the severity of aortic constriction. However, they 
      do not recapitulate the haemodynamics and flow patterns associated with the
      disease. Here, we report the development of a customizable soft robotic aortic
      sleeve that can mimic the haemodynamics and biomechanics of aortic stenosis. By
      allowing for the adjustment of actuation patterns and blood-flow dynamics, the
      robotic sleeve recapitulates clinically relevant haemodynamics in a porcine model
      of aortic stenosis, as we show by means of in vivo echocardiography and
      catheterization studies and via a combination of in vitro and computational
      analyses. We also quantified, by means of in vivo and in vitro magnetic resonance
      imaging, the four-dimensional blood-flow velocity profiles associated with the
      disease and with bicommissural and unicommissural defects recreated by the
      robotic sleeve. The design of the sleeve, which can be adjusted on the basis of
      computer-tomography data, allows for the design of patient-specific devices that 
      may guide clinical decisions and improve the management and treatment of patients
      with aortic stenosis.

TI  - Repositioning of drugs for Parkinson’s disease and pharmaceutical nanotechnology 
      tools for their optimization.
LID - 413
AB  - Parkinson’s disease (PD) significantly affects patients’ quality of life and
      represents a high economic burden for health systems. Given the lack of safe and 
      effective treatments for PD, drug repositioning seeks to offer new medication
      alternatives, reducing research time and costs compared to the traditional drug
      development strategy. This review aimed to collect evidence of drugs proposed as 
      candidates to be reused in PD and identify those with the potential to be
      reformulated into nanocarriers to optimize future repositioning trials. We
      conducted a detailed search in PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus from January
      2015 at the end of 2021, with the descriptors “Parkinson’s disease” and “drug
      repositioning” or “drug repurposing”. We identified 28 drugs as potential
      candidates, and six of them were found in repositioning clinical trials for PD.
      However, a limitation of many of these drugs to achieve therapeutic success is
      their inability to cross the blood–brain barrier (BBB), as is the case with
      nilotinib, which has shown promising outcomes in clinical trials. We suggest
      reformulating these drugs in biodegradable nanoparticles (NPs) based on lipids
      and polymers to perform future trials. As a complementary strategy, we propose
      functionalizing the NPs surface by adding materials to the surface layer. Among
      other advantages, functionalization can promote efficient crossing through the
      BBB and improve the affinity of NPs towards certain brain regions. The main
      parameters to consider for the design of NPs targeting the central nervous system
      are highlighted, such as size, PDI, morphology, drug load, and Z potential.
      Finally, current advances in the use of NPs for Parkinson's disease are cited.

TI  - Cardiolipin Strongly Inhibits the Leakage Activity of the Short Antimicrobial
      Peptide ATRA-1 in Comparison to LL-37, in Model Membranes Mimicking the Lipid
      Composition of Staphylococcus aureus.
LID - 304
AB  - Cardiolipin is one of the main phospholipid components of Staphylococcus aureus
      membranes. This lipid is found at varying concentrations in the bilayer,
      depending on the growth stage of the bacteria, and as a response to environmental
      stress. Cardiolipin is an anionic phospholipid with four acyl chains, which
      modulates the bending properties of the membrane due to its inverted conical
      shape. It has been shown to inhibit the pore forming activity of several
      antimicrobial peptides, in general doubling the peptide concentration needed to
      induce leakage. Here we find that the short snake-derived antimicrobial peptide
      ATRA-1 is inhibited by several orders of magnitude in the presence of cardiolipin
      in saturated membranes (DMPG) compared to the human cathelicidin LL-37, which is 
      only inhibited two-fold in its leakage-inducing concentration. The ATRA-1 is too 
      short to span the membrane and its leakage activity is likely related to
      detergent-like alterations of bilayer structure. Fluorescence spectroscopy shows 
      only a minor effect on ATRA-1 binding to DMPG membranes due to the presence of
      cardiolipin. However, FTIR spectroscopy shows that the acyl chain structure of
      DMPG membranes, containing cardiolipin, become more organized in the presence of 
      ATRA-1, as reflected by an increase in the gel to liquid-crystalline phase
      transition temperature. Instead, a depression in the melting temperature is
      induced by ATRA-1 in DMPG in the absence of cardiolipin. In comparison, LL-37
      induces a depression of the main phase transition of DMPG even in the presence of
      cardiolipin. These data suggest that cardiolipin inhibits the penetration of
      ATRA-1 into the membrane core, impeding its capacity to disrupt lipid packing.

TI  - Protein complexes in cells by AI‐assisted structural proteomics.
LID - e11544
AB  - Accurately modeling the structures of proteins and their complexes using
      artificial intelligence is revolutionizing molecular biology. Experimental data
      enable a candidate‐based approach to systematically model novel protein
      assemblies. Here, we use a combination of in‐cell crosslinking mass spectrometry 
      and co‐fractionation mass spectrometry (CoFrac‐MS) to identify protein–protein
      interactions in the model Gram‐positive bacterium Bacillus subtilis. We show that
      crosslinking interactions prior to cell lysis reveals protein interactions that
      are often lost upon cell lysis. We predict the structures of these protein
      interactions and others in the SubtiWiki database with AlphaFold‐Multimer and,
      after controlling for the false‐positive rate of the predictions, we propose
      novel structural models of 153 dimeric and 14 trimeric protein assemblies.
      Crosslinking MS data independently validates the AlphaFold predictions and
      scoring. We report and validate novel interactors of central cellular machineries
      that include the ribosome, RNA polymerase, and pyruvate dehydrogenase, assigning 
      function to several uncharacterized proteins. Our approach uncovers
      protein–protein interactions inside intact cells, provides structural insight
      into their interaction interfaces, and is applicable to genetically intractable
      organisms, including pathogenic bacteria.

TI  - Evaluation of Right Ventricular Function and Dyssynchrony in a Dog Model of Acute
      Pulmonary Embolism: Diagnostic Utility and Reversibility.
LID - 861064
AB  - Background: The diagnosis of acute pulmonary thromboembolism is challenging in
      dogs. Little has been reported on changes in echocardiographic indices in dogs
      with acute pulmonary thromboembolism. The objective of this study was to validate
      the relationship between echocardiographic indices and right heart
      catheterization variables in dogs with acute pulmonary embolism and to identify a
      useful echocardiographic index for diagnosing acute pulmonary embolism. Materials
      and Methods: Six healthy laboratory beagles were included in the study.
      Echocardiography and right heart catheterization were performed in a dog model of
      acute pulmonary embolism produced by microsphere injection. Echocardiographic
      indices, including the right ventricular (RV) Tei index, RV longitudinal strain, 
      and the dyssynchrony index using speckle tracking echocardiography, transmitral
      flow, and eccentricity index, were measured. Results: The mean pulmonary arterial
      pressure increased (22.2 ± 1.2 mmHg) and the blood pressure decreased after
      microsphere injection. Although the mean pulmonary arterial pressure remained
      elevated, the blood pressure recovered 2 days after the microsphere injection.
      Most echocardiographic indices of RV function were significantly impaired
      following microsphere injection and recovered after 2 days. In contrast, the RV
      Tei index was significantly impaired after microsphere injection and the
      impairment persisted after 2 days. Multivariable analysis revealed that the RV
      Tei index was an independent echocardiographic predictor of pulmonary vascular
      resistance (β = 0.88, P < 0.001), and transmitral early diastolic wave was an
      independent predictor of the cardiac index (β = −0.86, P = 0.001). Conclusions:
      The RV Tei index is a useful echocardiographic index for diagnosing acute
      pulmonary embolism. Ventricular interdependence may be an important factor
      causing low cardiac output in dogs with acute pulmonary embolism.

TI  - Development, refinement, and characterization of a nonhuman primate critical care
      environment.
LID - e0281548
AB  - Background: Systemic inflammatory response remains a poorly understood cause of
      morbidity and mortality after traumatic injury. Recent nonhuman primate (NHP)
      trauma models have been used to characterize the systemic response to trauma, but
      none have incorporated a critical care phase without the use of general
      anesthesia. We describe the development of a prolonged critical care environment 
      with sedation and ventilation support, and also report corresponding NHP biologic
      and inflammatory markers. Methods: Eight adult male rhesus macaques underwent
      ventilation with sedation for 48–96 hours in a critical care setting. Three of
      these NHPs underwent “sham” procedures as part of trauma control model
      development. Blood counts, chemistries, coagulation studies, and
      cytokines/chemokines were collected throughout the study, and histopathologic
      analysis was conducted at necropsy. Results: Eight NHPs were intentionally
      survived and extubated. Three NHPs were euthanized at 72–96 hours without
      extubation. Transaminitis occurred over the duration of ventilation, but renal
      function, acid-base status, and hematologic profile remained stable. Chemokine
      and cytokine analysis were notable for baseline fold-change for Il-6 and Il-1ra
      (9.7 and 42.7, respectively) that subsequently downtrended throughout the
      experiment unless clinical respiratory compromise was observed. Conclusions: A
      NHP critical care environment with ventilation support is feasible but requires
      robust resources. The inflammatory profile of NHPs is not profoundly altered by
      sedation and mechanical ventilation. NHPs are susceptible to the pulmonary
      effects of short-term ventilation and demonstrate a similar bioprofile response
      to ventilator-induced pulmonary pathology. This work has implications for further
      development of a prolonged care NHP model.

TI  - X‐ray exposure in cryoballoon versus radiofrequency ablation for atrial
      fibrillation over 7 years: A single center study.
PG  - 1017-27
AB  - Background: Facing an increasing number of radiofrequency ablation (RF) and
      cryoballoon ablation (CB) procedures for treatment of AF radiation exposure and
      its reduction is a focus point for interventional electrophysiologists.
      Objective: This study evaluated the procedural parameters of the different
      ablation methods focusing on radiation exposure and the BMI of the patients.
      Methods: One thousand one hundred and thirty‐three first procedural cases of
      pulmonary vein isolation in patients with paroxysmal and persistent AF treated
      with RF and CB‐based techniques were analyzed retrospectively over a period of
      7 years focusing on the endpoints dose area product (DAP, cGycm2), fluoroscopy
      time (FT, min) and procedural time (PT, min). Results: Of the 1133 patients (mean
      age 63.4 ± 11.4 years, BMI 28.9 ± 4.7) 335 patients received an RF procedure, 211
      patients were treated with the cryoballoon first generation (CB1), and 587
      patients with cryoballoon second generation (CB2), respectively. The mean DAP for
      the PVI was 508 ± 654 cGycm2 in RF procedures, 1077 ± 683 cGycm2 in
      CB1‐procedures, and 587 ± 489 cGycm2 in CB2‐procedures with fluoroscopy times
      significantly shorter in RF procedures (9.6 ± 5.2 min) as compared to
      17.7 ± 5.9 min in CB1‐ and 16.3 ± 6.3 min in CB2‐procedures (p < .001). At the
      same time, the procedure duration using RF (115 ± 33.5 min) was significantly
      longer than both in CB1 (96 ± 16.8 min) and CB2 procedures (75 ± 15.9 min).
      Conclusions: Despite longer fluoroscopy durations in the CB technique, the CB2
      resulted in a comparable low radiation exposure in PVI as compared to RF,
      accompanied by shorter procedure durations.

TI  - Impact of Impella RP Versus Vasoactive Treatment on Right and Left Ventricular
      Strain in a Porcine Model of Acute Cardiogenic Shock Induced by Right Coronary
      Artery Embolization.
LID - e8126
AB  - Background: The response of the left ventricle to cardiogenic shock (CS) caused
      by right ventricular (RV) infarction and the effect of treatment with either
      vasoactive treatment or Impella RP are not well described. We sought to determine
      RV and left ventricular longitudinal strain (LS) by echocardiography after
      initiation of either Impella RP or vasoactive treatment for CS induced by right
      coronary artery embolization. Methods and Results: CS was induced with
      microsphere embolization in the right coronary artery in 20 pigs. Shock was
      defined as a reduction in cardiac output of ≥50% and/or an SvO2 <30%. At the time
      of CS either Impella RP or vasoactive treatment (norepinephrine and milrinone)
      was initiated. Echocardiography and conductance measures were obtained at
      baseline, when CS was present, and 30, 90, and 180 minutes after induction of CS.
      Of 20 animals, 14 completed the protocol and were treated with either vasoactive 
      treatment (n=7) or Impella RP (n=7); 6 animals died (3 in each group). In the RV 
      there was a significantly higher LS with the vasoactive treatment compared with
      Impella RP (−7.6% [4.5] to −6.0% [5.2] vs −4.5% [6.6] to –14.2% [10.6]; P<0.006).
      Left ventricular LS improved with both treatments compared with shock, but with a
      larger effect (−9.4% [3.2] to −17.9% [3.6]) on LS with vasoactive treatment than 
      Impella RP (−9.8% [3.1] to −12.3% [4.6]; P<0.001). We found a significant
      correlation between stroke work and RV LS (r=−0.60, P<0.001) and left ventricular
      LS (r=−0.62, P<0.001). Conclusions: We found significantly higher hemodynamic
      effects with vasoactive treatment compared with Impella RP in both the RV and
      left ventricular but at a cost of increased stroke work.

TI  - Aortic Stenosis: Haemodynamic Benchmark and Metric Reliability Study.
PG  - 862-73
AB  - Aortic stenosis is a condition which is fatal if left untreated. Novel
      quantitative imaging techniques which better characterise transvalvular pressure 
      drops are being developed but require refinement and validation. A customisable
      and cost-effective workbench valve phantom circuit capable of replicating valve
      mechanics and pathology was created. The reproducibility and relationship of
      differing haemodynamic metrics were assessed from ground truth pressure data
      alongside imaging compatibility. The phantom met the requirements to capture
      ground truth pressure data alongside ultrasound and magnetic resonance image
      compatibility. The reproducibility was successfully tested. The robustness of
      three different pressure drop metrics was assessed: whilst the peak and net
      pressure drops provide a robust assessment of the stenotic burden in our phantom,
      the peak-to-peak pressure drop is a metric that is confounded by non-valvular
      factors such as wave reflection. The peak-to-peak pressure drop is a metric that 
      should be reconsidered in clinical practice.Graphical abstract: The left panel
      shows manufacture of low cost, functional valves. The central section
      demonstrates circuit layout, representative MRI and US images alongside gross
      valve morphologies. The right panel shows the different pressure drop metrics
      that were assessed for reproducibility Supplementary Information: The online
      version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s12265-022-10350-w.

TI  - Endothelial cell‐derived oxysterol ablation attenuates experimental autoimmune
      encephalomyelitis.
LID - e55328
AB  - The vasculature is a key regulator of leukocyte trafficking into the central
      nervous system (CNS) during inflammatory diseases including multiple sclerosis
      (MS). However, the impact of endothelial‐derived factors on CNS immune responses 
      remains unknown. Bioactive lipids, in particular oxysterols downstream of
      Cholesterol‐25‐hydroxylase (Ch25h), promote neuroinflammation but their functions
      in the CNS are not well‐understood. Using floxed‐reporter Ch25h knock‐in mice, we
      trace Ch25h expression to CNS endothelial cells (ECs) and myeloid cells and
      demonstrate that Ch25h ablation specifically from ECs attenuates experimental
      autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Mechanistically, inflamed Ch25h‐deficient CNS
      ECs display altered lipid metabolism favoring polymorphonuclear myeloid‐derived
      suppressor cell (PMN‐MDSC) expansion, which suppresses encephalitogenic
      T lymphocyte proliferation. Additionally, endothelial Ch25h‐deficiency combined
      with immature neutrophil mobilization into the blood circulation nearly
      completely protects mice from EAE. Our findings reveal a central role for CNS
      endothelial Ch25h in promoting neuroinflammation by inhibiting the expansion of
      immunosuppressive myeloid cell populations.

TI  - Intrinsic disorder in PRAME and its role in uveal melanoma.
LID - 222
AB  - Introduction: The PReferentially expressed Antigen in MElanoma (PRAME) protein
      has been shown to be an independent biomarker for increased risk of metastasis in
      Class 1 uveal melanomas (UM). Intrinsically disordered proteins and regions of
      proteins (IDPs/IDPRs) are proteins that do not have a well-defined
      three-dimensional structure and have been linked to neoplastic development. Our
      study aimed to evaluate the presence of intrinsic disorder in PRAME and the role 
      these structureless regions have in PRAME( +) Class 1 UM. Methods: A
      bioinformatics study to characterize PRAME’s propensity for the intrinsic
      disorder. We first used the AlphaFold tool to qualitatively assess the protein
      structure of PRAME. Then we used the Compositional Profiler and a set of
      per-residue intrinsic disorder predictors to quantify the intrinsic disorder. The
      Database of Disordered Protein Prediction (D2P2) platform, IUPred, FuzDrop,
      fIDPnn, AUCpred, SPOT-Disorder2, and metapredict V2 allowed us to evaluate the
      potential functional disorder of PRAME. Additionally, we used the Search Tool for
      the Retrieval of Interacting Genes (STRING) to analyze PRAME's potential
      interactions with other proteins. Results: Our structural analysis showed that
      PRAME contains intrinsically disordered protein regions (IDPRs), which are
      structureless and flexible. We found that PRAME is significantly enriched with
      serine (p-value < 0.05), a disorder-promoting amino acid. PRAME was found to have
      an average disorder score of 16.49% (i.e., moderately disordered) across six
      per-residue intrinsic disorder predictors. Our IUPred analysis revealed the
      presence of disorder-to-order transition (DOT) regions in PRAME near the
      C-terminus of the protein (residues 475–509). The D2P2 platform predicted a
      region from approximately 140 and 175 to be highly concentrated with
      post-translational modifications (PTMs). FuzDrop predicted the PTM hot spot of
      PRAME to be a droplet-promoting region and an aggregation hotspot. Finally, our
      analysis using the STRING tool revealed that PRAME has significantly more
      interactions with other proteins than expected for randomly selected proteins of 
      the same size, with the ability to interact with 84 different partners (STRING
      analysis result: p-value < 1.0 × 10–16; model confidence: 0.400). Conclusion: Our
      study revealed that PRAME has IDPRs that are possibly linked to its functionality
      in the context of Class 1 UM. The regions of functionality (i.e., DOT regions,
      PTM sites, droplet-promoting regions, and aggregation hotspots) are localized to 
      regions of high levels of disorder. PRAME has a complex protein–protein
      interaction (PPI) network that may be secondary to the structureless features of 
      the polypeptide. Our findings contribute to our understanding of UM and suggest
      that IDPRs and DOT regions in PRAME may be targeted in developing new therapies
      for this aggressive cancer.Video Abstract Supplementary Information: The online

TI  - Designing double-site lipidated peptide amphiphiles as potent antimicrobial
      biomaterials to combat multidrug-resistant bacteria.
LID - 1074359
AB  - Rapidly evolving antimicrobial resistance and extremely slow development of new
      antibiotics have resulted in multidrug-resistant bacterial infections that
      present a serious threat to human health. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) provide
      promising substitutes, but more research is needed to address several of their
      present limitations, such as insufficient antimicrobial potency, high toxicity,
      and low stability. Here, we designed a series of novel double-site lipidated
      peptide amphiphiles based on a heptad repeat parent pentadecapeptide. The
      double-site lipidated peptide amphiphiles showed a broad spectrum of
      antimicrobial activities. Especially the double-site lipidated peptide amphiphile
      WL-C6 exhibited high potency to inhibit multidrug-resistant bacteria without
      significant toxicity toward mammalian cells. Furthermore, even at physiological
      salt ion concentrations, WL-C6 still exhibited outstanding antibacterial
      properties, and a sizeable fraction of it maintained its molecular integrity
      after being incubated with different proteases. Additionally, we captured the
      entire process of WL-C6 killing bacteria and showed that the rapid bacterial
      membrane disruption is the reason of bacterial death. Overall, WL-C6 shows great 
      promise as a substitute for conventional antibiotics to combat the growing threat
      of multidrug-resistant bacterial infections.

TI  - The conformational landscape of a serpin N-terminal subdomain facilitates folding
      and in-cell quality control.
LID - 2023.04.24.537978
AB  - Many multi-domain proteins including the serpin family of serine protease
      inhibitors contain non-sequential domains composed of regions that are far apart 
      in sequence. Because proteins are translated vectorially from N- to C-terminus,
      such domains pose a particular challenge: how to balance the conformational
      lability necessary to form productive interactions between early and late
      translated regions while avoiding aggregation. This balance is mediated by the
      protein sequence properties and the interactions of the folding protein with the 
      cellular quality control machinery. For serpins, particularly α1-antitrypsin
      (AAT), mutations often lead to polymer accumulation in cells and consequent
      disease suggesting that the lability/aggregation balance is especially
      precarious. Therefore, we investigated the properties of progressively longer AAT
      N-terminal fragments in solution and in cells. The N-terminal subdomain, residues
      1–190 (AAT190), is monomeric in solution and efficiently degraded in cells. More 
      β-rich fragments, 1–290 and 1–323, form small oligomers in solution, but are
      still efficiently degraded, and even the polymerization promoting Siiyama (S53F) 
      mutation did not significantly affect fragment degradation. In vitro, the AAT190 
      region is among the last regions incorporated into the final structure.
      Hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry and enhanced sampling molecular
      dynamics simulations show that AAT190 has a broad, dynamic conformational
      ensemble that helps protect one particularly aggregation prone β-strand from
      solvent. These AAT190 dynamics result in transient exposure of sequences that are
      buried in folded, full-length AAT, which may provide important recognition sites 
      for the cellular quality control machinery and facilitate degradation and, under 
      favorable conditions, reduce the likelihood of polymerization.

TI  - Novel or established cryoballoon ablation system for pulmonary vein isolation:
      the prospective ICE-AGE-1 study.
LID - euad248
AB  - Aims: Catheter ablation with a cryoballoon (CB) provides effective and durable
      pulmonary vein (PV) isolation (PVI) associated with encouraging clinical outcome 
      data. The novel POLARx CB incorporates unique features, which may translate into 
      improved safety, efficacy, and outcomes. The ICE-AGE-1 study aimed to assess the 
      efficacy, safety, and 1-year clinical follow-up of the POLARx CB in comparison to
      the Arctic Front Advance Pro CB (AF-CB4). Methods and results: A total of 103
      consecutive patients with paroxysmal or persistent atrial fibrillation (AF) who
      underwent POLARx-based PVI (POLARx group) were prospectively enrolled and were
      compared to 102 consecutive patients previously treated with the AF-CB4 (AF-CB4
      group). The mean age was 68.7 ± 10.2 (POLARx) and 65.7 ± 12 (AF-CB4, P = 0.0551) 
      years. A total of 412 (POLARx) and 404 (AF-CB4) PVs were identified. All PVs,
      except for one PV in the POLARx group, were successfully isolated. A significant 
      difference regarding the mean minimal CB temperature reached using the POLARx CB 
      (−56.1 ± 8.3°C) and AF-CB4 (−46.9 ± 10.1°C) was observed (P < 0.0001). Real-time 
      PVI was visualized in 71% of PVs in the POLARx group and 46% of them in the
      AF-CB4 group (P < 0.001). The mean procedure time was comparable: 54.5 ± 17.1 min
      for POLARx and 59.4 ± 18.6 min for AF-CB4 (P = 0.0509). No differences were
      observed in terms of periprocedural complications. There were comparable rates in
      freedom of AF or atrial tachycardia recurrence after 12 months, beyond a 90-day
      long blanking period: 78.9% in the POLARx group vs. 77.2% in the AF-CB4 group (P 
      = 0.804). Conclusion: The novel POLARx CB showed similar safety, efficacy, and
      1-year recurrence-free survival rates compared to the AF-CB4. A higher rate of
      real-time electrical PV recordings and significantly lower balloon temperatures
      were observed using the POLARx as compared to AF-CB4.

TI  - Metallo-Drugs in Cancer Therapy: Past, Present and Future.
LID - 6485
AB  - Cancer treatments which include conventional chemotherapy have not proven very
      successful in curing human malignancies. The failures of these treatment
      modalities include inherent resistance, systemic toxicity and severe side
      effects. Out of 50% patients administrated to chemotherapy, only 5% survive. For 
      these reasons, the identification of new drug designs and therapeutic strategies 
      that could target cancer cells while leaving normal cells unaffected still
      continues to be a challenge. Despite advances that have led to the development of
      new therapies, treatment options are still limited for many types of cancers.
      This review provides an overview of platinum, copper and ruthenium metal based
      anticancer drugs in clinical trials and in vitro/in vivo studies. Presumably,
      copper and ruthenium complexes have greater potential than Pt(II) complexes,
      showing reduced toxicity, a new mechanism of action, a different spectrum of
      activity and the possibility of non-cross-resistance. We focus the discussion
      towards past, present and future aspects.

TI  - Not to Rush—Laboratory Parameters and Procedural Complications in Patients
      Undergoing Left Atrial Appendage Closure.
LID - 6548
AB  - Background: As a preventive procedure, minimizing periprocedural risk is
      crucially important during left atrial appendage closure (LAAC). Methods: We
      included consecutive patients receiving LAAC at nine centres and assessed the
      relationship between baseline characteristics and the acute procedural outcome.
      Major procedural complications were defined as all complications requiring
      immediate invasive intervention or causing irreversible damage. Logistic
      regression was performed and included age and left-ventricular function.
      Furthermore, the association between acute complications and long-term outcomes
      was evaluated. Results: A total of 405 consecutive patients with a median age of 
      75 years (37% female) were included. 47% had a history of stroke. Median
      CHA2DS2-VASc score was 4 (interquartile range, 3–5) and the median HAS-BLED score
      was 3 (2–4). Major procedural complications occurred in 7% of cases. Low
      haemoglobin (OR 0.8, 95% CI 0.65–0.99 per g/dL, p = 0.040) and end-stage kidney
      disease (OR 13.0, CI 2.5–68.5, p = 0.002) remained significant in multivariate
      analysis. Anaemia (haemoglobin < 12 and < 13 g/dL in female and male patients)
      increased the risk of complications 2.2-fold. Conclusions: The major complication
      rate was low in this high-risk patient population undergoing LAAC. End-stage
      kidney disease and low baseline haemoglobin were independently associated with a 
      higher major complication rate.

TI  - PKR Protects the Major Catalytic Subunit of PKA Cpk1 from FgBlm10-Mediated
      Proteasome Degradation in Fusarium graminearum.
LID - 10208
AB  - For optimal proteolytic function, the proteasome core (CP or 20S) must associate 
      with activators. The cAMP-PKA pathway is reported to affect the activity of the
      proteasome in humans. However, the relationship between the proteasome and PKA is
      not well characterized. Our results showed that the major catalytic subunit Cpk1 
      was degraded without the protection of Pkr. Eleven (out of 67) pkr suppressors
      had FgBlm10 C-terminal truncation, one suppressor had an amino acid change
      mutation in the PRE6 ortholog (FGRRES_07282), and one in the PRE5 ortholog
      (FGRRES_05222). These mutations rescued the defects in growth and conidial
      morphology, Cpk1 stability, and PKA activities in the pkr mutant. The interaction
      of FgBlm10 with FgPre5 and FgPre6 were detected by co-immunoprecipitation, and
      the essential elements for their interaction were characterized, including the
      FgBlm10 C-terminus, amino acid D82 of FgPre6 and K62 of FgPre5. Additional
      FgBlm10-interacting proteins were identified in the wild type and pkr mutant,
      suggesting that PKA regulates the preference of FgBlm10-mediated proteasome
      assembly. In addition, PKA indirectly affected the phosphorylation of FgBlm10,
      and its localization in the nucleus. The truncation of the FgBlm10 C terminus
      also enhanced nuclear import and bleomycin resistance, suggesting its role in
      proteasome assembly at DNA damage sites. Collectively, our data demonstrated that
      regulation between PKA and proteasome degradation is critical for the vegetative 
      growth of F. graminearum.

TI  - Renal Denervation Attenuates Adverse Remodeling and Intramyocardial Inflammation 
      in Acute Myocardial Infarction With Ischemia–Reperfusion Injury.
LID - 832014
AB  - Background: Inhibition of sympathetic activity and renin–angiotensin system with 
      renal denervation (RDN) was proved to be effective in managing refractory
      hypertension, and improving left ventricular (LV) performance in chronic heart
      failure. The inhibition of sustained sympathetic activation prevents or delays
      the development of cardiac fibrosis and dysfunction that occurs after myocardial 
      infarction and ischemia–reperfusion (I/R) injury. The translational efficiency of
      RDN remains to be defined in preclinical animal studies. Objectives: This study
      investigated the therapeutic role of RDN in adverse remodeling and
      intramyocardial inflammation in myocardial ischemia–reperfusion (MI/R) injury.
      Methods: Herein, 15 minipigs were subjected to 90-min percutaneous occlusion of
      the left anterior descending artery followed by reperfusion. Eight animals
      received simultaneous RDN using catheter-based radiofrequency ablation
      (MI/R-RDN). Cardiac function and infarct volume were measured in vivo, followed
      by histological and biochemical analyses. Results: The infarct volume in I/R-RDN 
      pigs reduced at 30 days postreperfusion, compared to I/R-Sham animals. The levels
      of catecholamine and cytokines in the serum, kidney cortex, the border, and
      infarcted regions of the heart were significantly reduced in I/R-RDN group.
      Moreover, the gene expression of collagen and the protein expression of
      adrenergic receptor beta 1 in heart were also decreased in I/R-RDN mice.
      Additionally, RDN therapy alleviated myocardial oxidative stress. Conclusion: RDN
      is an effective therapeutic strategy for counteracting postreperfusion myocardial
      injury and dysfunction, and the application of RDN holds promising prospects in
      clinical practice.

TI  - Chronic intermittent hypoxia promotes glomerular hyperfiltration and potentiates 
      hypoxia-evoked decreases in renal perfusion and PO2.
LID - 1235289
AB  - Introduction: Sleep apnea (SA) is highly prevalent in patients with chronic
      kidney disease and may contribute to the development and/or progression of this
      condition. Previous studies suggest that dysregulation of renal hemodynamics and 
      oxygen flux may play a key role in this process. The present study sought to
      determine how chronic intermittent hypoxia (CIH) associated with SA affects
      regulation of renal artery blood flow (RBF), renal microcirculatory perfusion
      (RP), glomerular filtration rate (GFR), and cortical and medullary tissue PO2 as 
      well as expression of genes that could contribute to renal injury. We
      hypothesized that normoxic RBF and tissue PO2 would be reduced after CIH, but
      that GFR would be increased relative to baseline, and that RBF, RP, and tissue
      PO2 would be decreased to a greater extent in CIH vs. sham during exposure to
      intermittent asphyxia (IA, FiO2 0.10/FiCO2 0.03). Additionally, we hypothesized
      that gene programs promoting oxidative stress and fibrosis would be activated by 
      CIH in renal tissue.Methods: All physiological variables were measured at
      baseline (FiO2 0.21) and during exposure to 10 episodes of IA (excluding
      GFR).Results: GFR was higher in CIH-conditioned vs. sham (p < 0.05), whereas
      normoxic RBF and renal tissue PO2 were significantly lower in CIH vs. sham (p <
      0.05). Reductions in RBF, RP, and renal tissue PO2 during IA occurred in both
      groups but to a greater extent in CIH (p < 0.05). Pro-oxidative and pro-fibrotic 
      gene programs were activated in renal tissue from CIH but not sham.Conclusion:
      CIH adversely affects renal hemodynamic regulation and oxygen flux during both
      normoxia and IA and results in changes in renal tissue gene expression.

LID - mfac076
AB  - Non-invasive imaging techniques to dynamically map whole-body trafficking of
      essential metals in vivo in health and diseases are needed. Despite 62Zn having
      appropriate physical properties for positron emission tomography (PET) imaging
      (half-life, 9.3 h; positron emission, 8.2%), its complex decay via 62Cu
      (half-life, 10 min; positron emission, 97%) has limited its use. We aimed to
      develop a method to extract 62Zn from a 62Zn/62Cu generator, and to investigate
      its use for in vivo imaging of zinc trafficking despite its complex decay. 62Zn
      prepared by proton irradiation of natural copper foil was used to construct a
      conventional 62Zn/62Cu generator. 62Zn was eluted using trisodium citrate and
      used for biological experiments, compared with 64Cu in similar buffer. PET/CT
      imaging and ex vivo tissue radioactivity measurements were performed following
      intravenous injection in healthy mice. [62Zn]Zn-citrate was readily eluted from
      the generator with citrate buffer. PET imaging with the eluate demonstrated
      biodistribution similar to previous observations with the shorter-lived 63Zn
      (half-life 38.5 min), with significant differences compared to [64Cu]Cu-citrate, 
      notably in pancreas (>10-fold higher at 1 h post-injection). Between 4 and 24 h, 
      62Zn retention in liver, pancreas, and kidney declined over time, while brain
      uptake increased. Like 64Cu, 62Zn showed hepatobiliary excretion from liver to
      intestines, unaffected by fasting. Although it offers limited reliability of
      scanning before 1 h post-injection, 62Zn-PET allows investigation of zinc
      trafficking in vivo for >24 h and hence provides a useful new tool to investigate
      diseases where zinc homeostasis is disrupted in preclinical models and humans.

TI  - Echocardiographic Evaluation of Aortic Stenosis: A Comprehensive Review.
LID - 2527
AB  - Echocardiography represents the most important diagnostic tool in the evaluation 
      of aortic stenosis. The echocardiographic assessment of its severity should
      always be performed through a standardized and stepwise approach in order to
      achieve a comprehensive evaluation. The latest technical innovations in the field
      of echocardiography have improved diagnostic accuracy, guaranteeing a better and 
      more detailed evaluation of aortic valve anatomy. An early diagnosis is of utmost
      importance since it shortens treatment delays and improves patient outcomes.
      Echocardiography plays a key role also in the evaluation of all the structural
      changes related to aortic stenosis. Detailed evaluation of subtle and subclinical
      changes in left ventricle function has a prognostic significance: scientific
      efforts have been addressed to identify the most accurate global longitudinal
      strain cut-off value able to predict adverse outcomes. Moreover, in recent years 
      the role of artificial intelligence is increasingly emerging as a promising tool 
      able to assist cardiologists in aortic stenosis screening and diagnosis,
      especially by reducing the rate of aortic stenosis misdiagnosis.

TI  - The Effects of Positive End Expiratory Pressure and Lung Volume on Diaphragm
      Thickness and Thickening.
LID - 1157
AB  - Introduction: Diaphragm dysfunction is common in patients undergoing mechanical
      ventilation. The application of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) and the
      varying end-expiratory lung volume cause changes in diaphragm geometry. We aimed 
      to assess the impact of the level of PEEP and lung inflation on diaphragm
      thickness, thickening fraction and displacement. Methods: An observational study 
      in a mixed medical and surgical ICU was conducted. The patients underwent a
      PEEP-titration trial with the application of three random levels of PEEP: 0 cmH2O
      (PEEP0), 8 cmH2O (PEEP8) and 15 cmH2O (PEEP15). At each step, the indices of
      respiratory effort were assessed, together with arterial blood and diaphragm
      ultrasound; end-expiratory lung volume was measured. Results: 14 patients were
      enrolled. The tidal volume, diaphragm displacement and thickening fraction were
      significantly lower with higher levels of PEEP, while both the expiratory and
      inspiratory thickness increased with higher PEEP levels. The inspiratory effort, 
      as evaluated by the esophageal pressure swing, was unchanged. Both the diaphragm 
      thickening fraction and displacement were significantly correlated with
      inspiratory effort in the whole dataset. For both measurements, the correlation
      was stronger at lower levels of PEEP. The difference in the diaphragm thickening 
      fraction during tidal breathing between PEEP 15 and PEEP 0 was negatively related
      to the change in the functional residual capacity and the change in alveolar dead
      space. Conclusions: Different levels of PEEP significantly modified the
      diaphragmatic thickness and thickening fraction, showing a PEEP-induced decrease 
      in the diaphragm contractile efficiency. When using ultrasound to assess
      diaphragm size and function, the potential effect of lung inflation should be
      taken into account.

TI  - Procedural and outcome impact of obesity in cryoballoon versus radiofrequency
      pulmonary vein isolation in atrial fibrillation patients.
PG  - 403-10
AB  - Purpose: Cryoballoon (CB) ablation and radiofrequency (RF) ablation are the most 
      common techniques for pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) in patients with symptomatic
      atrial fibrillation (AF). An increasing number of patients undergoing PVI are
      obese.To address the paucity of data on outcomes of CB- vs. RF-based PVI in
      relation to body mass index (BMI) of AF patients. Methods: All patients
      undergoing de novo PVI between 01/2018 and 08/2019 at University Hospital Cologne
      were included in this retrospective analysis. Patients of each group (CB-PVI vs. 
      RF-PVI) were analyzed based on their BMI. Hereafter, procedural characteristics
      and AF recurrence rate were compared regarding different BMI groups. Results: A
      total of 526 patients (62% male, 65±11 years) underwent successful de novo PVI
      (320 CB and 206 RF). In obese patients, two differences in procedural
      characteristics were noted: A significantly increased contrast medium volume in
      CB group and a lower fluoroscopy dose in RF group: contrast medium: CB 50 [40-80]
      vs. RF 20 [20-30], p<0.001; fluoroscopy dose: CB 392.4 [197.9-995.9] vs. RF 282.5
      [139.8-507.2], p<0.001. The complication rate was equal throughout all BMI
      groups, regardless of CB or RF usage. For obese patients, a trend toward a higher
      AF recurrence rate was revealed after RF-PVI as compared to CB-PVI. In line with 
      previous studies, the overall procedure time was significantly shorter with
      CB-PVI regardless of BMI. Conclusion: For obese patients, CB-PVI is similarly
      safe and effective as RF-PVI. The significantly shorter procedure time for CB-PVI
      may minimize potential obesity-related complications. However, the lower contrast
      medium quantity and fluoroscopy dose in RF-PVI must be considered. AF recurrence 
      rates were comparable between CB-PVI and RF-PVI.

TI  - Collision Pressure and Dissipated Power Dose in a Self-Oscillating Silicone Vocal
      Fold Model With a Posterior Glottal Opening.
PG  - 2829-45
AB  - Purpose:: The goal of this study was to experimentally evaluate how compensating 
      for the adverse acoustic effects of a posterior glottal opening (PGO) by
      increasing subglottal pressure and changing supraglottal compression, as have
      been associated with vocal hyperfunction, influences the risk of vocal fold (VF) 
      trauma. Method:: A self-oscillating synthetic silicone model of the VFs with an
      airflow bypass that modeled a PGO was investigated in a hemilaryngeal flow
      facility. The influence of compensatory mechanisms on collision pressure and
      dissipated collision power was investigated for different PGO areas and
      supraglottal compression. Compensatory behaviors were mimicked by increasing the 
      subglottal pressure to achieve a target sound pressure level (SPL). Results::
      Increasing the subglottal pressure to compensate for decreased SPL due to a PGO
      produced higher values for both collision pressure and dissipated collision
      power. Whereas a 10-mm2 PGO area produced a 12% increase in the peak collision
      pressure, the dissipated collision power increased by 122%, mainly due to an
      increase in the magnitude of the collision velocity. This suggests that the value
      of peak collision pressure may not fully capture the mechanisms by which
      phonotrauma occurs. It was also found that an optimal value of supraglottal
      compression exists that maximizes the radiated SPL, indicating the potential
      utility of supraglottal compression as a compensatory mechanism. Conclusions::
      Larger PGO areas are expected to increase the risk of phonotrauma due to the
      concomitant increase in dissipated collision power associated with maintaining
      SPL. Furthermore, the risk of VF damage may not be fully characterized by only
      the peak collision pressure.

TI  - Optimal single procedure strategy of pulmonary vein isolation with cryoballoon or
      radiofrequency and non-pulmonary vein triggers ablation for non-paroxysmal atrial
      fibrillation☆.
LID - 101021
AB  - Background: Limited data exist on pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) using
      cryoballoon (CB) or radiofrequency (RF) ablation and additional non-pulmonary
      vein trigger ablation for non-paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (non-PAF). We aimed 
      to assess the outcomes of first-stage catheter ablation for non-PAF patients.
      Methods: Initial PVI was performed on 734 non-PAF patients (age: 64 ± 10 years;
      male: 584 (80%)) between September 2014 and June 2018 [315 (43%), CB ablation;
      419 (57%), RF catheter]. A logistic regression model was used to match 257 pairs 
      (514 patients) according to the propensity scores (CB or RF group). After PVI,
      additional non-PV trigger ablation was performed if induced by isoproterenol. We 
      analysed the clinical outcomes of both groups. Results: The mean procedural time 
      was significantly shorter in the CB group (125 [range, 89–165] min) than in the
      RF group (190 [160–224] min; P < 0.001). The 1-year Kaplan-Meier event rate
      revealed similar atrial fibrillation-free survival rates between the two groups
      (CB: 77.9%, RF: 82.3%; log-rank P = 0.111). The additional ablation percentage
      for non-PV foci (CB: 39%, RF: 41%; P = 0.653) and complication incidence (CB: 5%,
      RF: 4%; P = 0.670) were also similar. Conclusions: In non-PAF patients, the
      combination strategy of PVI using CB or RF ablation and non-PV trigger ablation
      achieved comparable outcomes.

TI  - Atrial Septal Defect Occluder Device Embolization: Experience of a Tertiary Care 
      Cardiac Center.
PG  - 149-54
AB  - Background:: Percutaneous device closure of atrial septal defect (ASD) has become
      an increasingly popular procedure as it offers several advantages. However, it is
      associated with infrequent, but life-threatening complications such as device
      embolization. Objective:: To analyze the risk factors, common sites of
      embolization, associated complications, timing of embolization, and the treatment
      executed. Settings and Design:: A retrospective study was performed at a tertiary
      referral center for cardiac services. Material and Methods:: Pre-procedure,
      intra-procedure, and post-procedure data of patients whose ASD device embolized
      was collected retrospectively and analyzed for risk factors, common sites of
      embolization, associated complications, timing of embolization, and the treatment
      executed. Results:: Thirty devices were embolized, out of which 13 were retrieved
      percutaneously in the Catheter laboratory, whereas 17 patients underwent surgery.
      Fourteen patients had an unfavorable septal morphology for device closure. Ten
      devices were embolized in the catheter laboratory, five in the intensive care
      unit, and two in the ward. The devices were embolized to almost all chambers of
      the heart and great vessels. One patient had an inferior vena cava rim tear while
      attempting percutaneous retrieval. One patient required a short period of total
      circulatory arrest (TCA) for retrieval of the device from ascending aorta, while 
      another required a lateral position for retrieval from descending aorta. One
      patient required re-exploration for bleeding, while another had an air embolism
      and succumbed. Conclusions:: Once embolization occurs, the risks associated
      increase manifold. Most of the surgical extractions are uneventful; however,
      there could be certain complications that may need repair of valvular apparatus, 
      the institution of TCA, or the need for the lateral position. Air embolization
      though very rare can occur which could be fatal.

TI  - Acute coronary syndromes in chronic hemodialysis patients: a series of 34 cases
      (case series).
PG  - 3791-6
AB  - Cardiovascular diseases, particularly acute coronary syndrome, are the leading
      cause of death in chronic hemodialysis patients. Our study aims to analyze the
      pathophysiological, clinical, angiographic, and therapeutic characteristics of
      coronary heart disease in hemodialysis patients.Patients and Methods:: This
      single-centered retrospective descriptive study included 34 hemodialysis patients
      hospitalized in the cardiovascular ICU. Results:: The mean age of patients in our
      study was 64.4±11.3 years. The main cardiovascular risk factor found in our study
      was age, with a prevalence of 76.50%, followed by hypertension, with a prevalence
      of 67.60%. Diabetes was present in 55.90% of patients. The authors also found
      that 17.90% of patients were obese, and 29.40% had abdominal obesity. The main
      cause of renal disease in our study was diabetic nephropathy (52.90% of cases),
      followed by hypertensive nephropathy (23.50% of cases). ST segment elevation
      myocardial infarction was found in 14.70% of cases, and non-ST-segment elevation 
      myocardial infarction in 85.30% of cases. Coronary angiography was performed in
      76.40% of patients. Single-vessel coronary artery disease (CAD) was found in 20%,
      two-vessel CAD in 50%, and three-vessel CAD in 30% of the cases. Coronary artery 
      calcifications were observed in 21.42% of cases. 38.23% had an angioplasty, and
      20.58% were referred for a coronary artery bypass graft. Conclusion:: Despite the
      high mortality rate after acute coronary syndrome, hemodialysis patients are less
      likely to undergo diagnostic angiography or coronary revascularization. Patients 
      on hemodialysis tend to have multiple, diffuse, calcified CAD.

TI  - Precision medicine and drug optimization in adult inflammatory bowel disease
      patients.
LID - 17562848231173331
AB  - Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) encompass two main entities including
      ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease. Although having a common global
      pathophysiological mechanism, IBD patients are characterized by a significant
      interindividual heterogeneity and may differ by their disease type, disease
      locations, disease behaviours, disease manifestations, disease course as well as 
      treatment needs. Indeed, although the therapeutic armamentarium for these
      diseases has expanded rapidly in recent years, a proportion of patients remains
      with a suboptimal response to medical treatment due to primary non-response,
      secondary loss of response or intolerance to currently available drugs.
      Identifying, prior to treatment initiation, which patients are likely to respond 
      to a specific drug would improve the disease management, avoid unnecessary side
      effects and reduce the healthcare expenses. Precision medicine classifies
      individuals into subpopulations according to clinical and molecular
      characteristics with the objective to tailor preventative and therapeutic
      interventions to the characteristics of each patient. Interventions would thus be
      performed only on those who will benefit, sparing side effects and expense for
      those who will not. This review aims to summarize clinical factors, biomarkers
      (genetic, transcriptomic, proteomic, metabolic, radiomic or from the microbiota) 
      and tools that could predict disease progression to guide towards a step-up or
      top-down strategy. Predictive factors of response or non-response to treatment
      will then be reviewed, followed by a discussion about the optimal dose of drug
      required for patients. The time at which these treatments should be administered 
      (or rather can be stopped in case of a deep remission or in the aftermath of a
      surgery) will also be addressed. IBD remain biologically complex, with
      multifactorial etiopathology, clinical heterogeneity as well as temporal and
      therapeutic variabilities, which makes precision medicine especially challenging 
      in this area. Although applied for many years in oncology, it remains an unmet
      medical need in IBD.

TI  - Rhythmia zero-fluoroscopy workflow with high-power, short-duration ablation:
      retrospective analysis of procedural data.
PG  - 499-507
AB  - Background: Fluoroscopy is commonly used during atrial fibrillation (AF) ablation
      to guide catheter navigation and placement. Technology improvements have
      significantly reduced fluoroscopy time, and subsequent radiation dose, necessary 
      to perform successful ablations. However, there is still no amount of radiation
      exposure known to be completely safe. The aim of this manuscript is to describe a
      detailed zero-fluoroscopy RHYTHMIA HDx workflow for AF ablation. Methods: This
      was an observational, single-center experience to describe the technique, acute
      procedural success, and safety using a novel zero-fluoroscopy workflow with the
      RHYTHMIA HDx mapping system and intracardiac echocardiography (ICE). Seventy-two 
      consecutive patients undergoing de novo or redo AF ablation were retrospectively 
      analyzed. Venous access was guided with ultrasound. ICE combined with the mapping
      system’s magnetic tracking and sheath detection was used for precise catheter
      placement in the coronary sinus, at the transseptal puncture, and in the left
      atrium. A high-power, short-duration ablation strategy guided by local impedance 
      was used. Pulmonary vein isolation was performed or touched up for all patients
      with additional lines added at the operator’s discretion. Results: Using this
      zero-fluoroscopy workflow, all patients achieved acute isolation with no
      significant procedure-related complications. Average procedure time was
      73.7 ± 16.2 min, which included persistent (58%) and paroxysmal (42%) AF cases,
      and no procedures required conversion to fluoroscopy. Conclusions: In this
      experience, a zero-fluoroscopy workflow using the RHYTHMIA HDx mapping system
      combined with ICE was feasible and safe for ablation in a heterogenous AF
      population. This approach, in the appropriate patient population, can eliminate
      radiation exposure to patients and staff.

TI  - Comparative Proteome Profiling of Saliva Between Estrus and Non-Estrus Stages by 
      Employing Label-Free Quantitation (LFQ) and Tandem Mass Tag (TMT)-LC-MS/MS
      Analysis: An Approach for Estrus Biomarker Identification in Bubalus bubalis.
LID - 867909
AB  - Accurate determination of estrus is essentially required for efficient
      reproduction management of farm animals. Buffalo is a shy breeder and does not
      manifest overt signs of estrus that make estrus detection difficult resulting in 
      a poor conception rate. Therefore, identifying estrus biomarkers in easily
      accessible biofluid such as saliva is of utmost interest. In the current study,
      we generated saliva proteome profiles during proestrus (PE), estrus (E),
      metestrus (ME), and diestrus (DE) stages of the buffalo estrous cycle using both 
      label-free quantitation (LFQ) and labeled (TMT) quantitation and mass
      spectrometry analysis. A total of 520 proteins were identified as DEPs in LFQ;
      among these, 59 and four proteins were upregulated (FC ≥ 1.5) and downregulated
      (FC ≤ 0.5) during E vs. PE, ME, and DE comparisons, respectively. Similarly,
      TMT-LC-MS/MS analysis identified 369 DEPs; among these, 74 and 73 proteins were
      upregulated and downregulated during E vs. PE, ME, and DE stages, respectively.
      Functional annotations of GO terms showed enrichment of glycolysis, pyruvate
      metabolism, endopeptidase inhibitor activity, salivary secretion, innate immune
      response, calcium ion binding, oocyte meiosis, and estrogen signaling.
      Over-expression of SERPINB1, HSPA1A, VMO1, SDF4, LCN1, OBP, and ENO3 proteins
      during estrus was further confirmed by Western blotting. This is the first
      comprehensive report on differential proteome analysis of buffalo saliva between 
      estrus and non-estrus stages. This study generated an important panel of
      candidate proteins that may be considered buffalo estrus biomarkers which can be 
      applied in the development of a diagnostic kit for estrus detection in buffalo.

TI  - Feasibility and safety of a three-dimensional anatomic map–guided transseptal
      puncture for left-sided catheter ablation procedures.
PG  - 1126-34
AB  - Aims: Transseptal puncture (TP) for left-sided catheter ablation procedures is
      routinely performed under fluoroscopic or echocardiographic guidance
      [transoesophageal echocardiography (TEE) or intracardiac echocardiography (ICE)],
      although three-dimensional (3D) mapping systems are readily available in most
      electrophysiology laboratories. Here, we sought to assess the feasibility and
      safety of a right atrial (RA) 3D map–guided TP. Methods and results: In 104
      patients, 3D RA mapping was performed to identify the fossa ovalis (FO) using the
      protrusion technique. The radiofrequency transseptal needle was visualized and
      navigated to the desired potential FO-TP site. Thereafter, the interventionalist 
      was unblinded to TEE and the potential FO-TP site was reassessed regarding its
      convenience and safety. After TP, the exact TP site was documented using a
      17-segment-FO model. Reliable identification of the FO was feasible in 102
      patients (98%). In these, 114 3D map–guided TP attempts were performed, of which 
      96 (84%) patients demonstrated a good position and 18 (16%) an adequate position 
      after TEE unblinding. An out-of-FO or dangerous position did not occur. A
      successful 3D map–guided TP was performed in 110 attempts (97%). Four attempts
      (3%) with adequate positions were aborted in order to seek a more convenient TP
      site. The median time from RA mapping until the end of the TP process was 13
      (12–17) min. No TP-related complications occurred. Ninety-eight TP sites (85.1%) 
      were in the central portion or in the inner loop of the FO. Conclusion: A 3D
      map–guided TP is feasible and safe. It may assist to decrease radiation exposure 
      and the need for TEE/ICE during left-sided catheter ablation procedures.

AB  - Marker-assisted selective breeding of fish with higher levels of resistance
      towards specific pathogens may improve fish health, but the impact of host
      genotype on susceptibility to multiple pathogen infections is still poorly
      investigated. This study examined the resistance in rainbow trout Oncorhynchus
      mykiss towards infection with the eye fluke Diplostomum pseudospathaceum. We used
      genetically selected rainbow trout, carrying SNPs associated with resistance
      towards the parasitic ciliate Ichthyophthirius multifiliis, and exposed the fish 
      to eye fluke cercariae. We showed that fish partly resistant to I. multifiliis
      were more susceptible to eye fluke invasion. The expression of immune relevant
      genes (encoding innate and adaptive factors) was also affected as these genotypes
      responded less strongly to a secondary fluke infection. The complexity of genome 
      architecture in disease resistance towards multiple pathogens is discussed.

TI  - Readiness for transfer: a mixed-methods study on ICU transfers of care.
LID - e064492
AB  - Objective: Past studies on intensive care unit (ICU) patient transfers compare
      the efficacy of using standardised checklists against unstructured
      communications. Less studied are the experiences of clinicians in enacting
      bidirectional (send/receive) transfers. This study reports on the differences in 
      protocols and data elements between receiving and sending transfers in the ICU,
      and the elements constituting readiness for transfer. Methods: Mixed-methods
      study of a 574-bed general hospital in Singapore with a 74-bed ICU for surgical
      and medical patients. Six focus group discussions (FGDs) with 34 clinicians
      comprising 15 residents and 19 nurses, followed by a structured questionnaire
      survey of 140 clinicians comprising 21 doctors and 119 nurses. FGD transcripts
      were analysed according to the standard qualitative research guidelines. Survey
      data were analysed using Student’s t-test with Bonferroni corrections. Results:
      General ward (GW) clinicians are more likely to receive ICU patients with
      complete discharge summaries while ICU clinicians receiving GW patients get
      significantly less data. Emergency department (ED), GW and operating theatre
      physicians accompany their patients to the ICU while ICU nurses accompany their
      patients to the GW. Not all units, such as the ED, experience bidirectional
      transfers. Conclusion: The protocols and supporting data elements of an ICU
      transfer vary by the type of transfer and transferring unit. Readiness for
      transfer means that sending unit protocols affirmatively consider the needs of
      the receiving unit’s data needs and resource constraints.

TI  - Immunomodulatory Properties of Vitamin D in the Intestinal and Respiratory
      Systems.
LID - 1696
AB  - Vitamin D plays a crucial role in modulating the innate immune response by
      interacting with its intracellular receptor, VDR. In this review, we address
      vitamin D/VDR signaling and how it contributes to the regulation of intestinal
      and respiratory microbiota. We additionally review some components of the innate 
      immune system, such as the barrier function of the pulmonary and intestinal
      epithelial membranes and secretion of mucus, with their respective modulation by 
      vitamin D. We also explore the mechanisms by which this vitamin D/VDR signaling
      mounts an antimicrobial response through the transduction of microbial signals
      and the production of antimicrobial peptides that constitute one of the body’s
      first lines of defense against pathogens. Additionally, we highlight the role of 
      vitamin D in clinical diseases, namely inflammatory bowel disease and acute
      respiratory distress syndrome, where excessive inflammatory responses and
      dysbiosis are hallmarks. Increasing evidence suggests that vitamin D
      supplementation may have potentially beneficial effects on those diseases.

TI  - Clinical validation of an elastin-derived trifunctional peptide for skin
      regeneration.
PG  - 4620-8
AB  - Aging is associated with progressive skin fragility, characterized in part by
      extracellular matrix (ECM) fragmentation. This degradation produces matrikines
      which have an impact on ECM rremodeling. Our group previously designed and
      characterized a trifunctional peptide (TFP), constituted of i) an elastokine
      motif (VGVAPG)3, able to increase the expression of matrix constituent through
      the stimulation of the elastin-binding protein receptor, ii) a tripeptide
      inhibiting matrix metalloproteinase-1 activity (GIL), and iii) a linker domain
      acting as a competitive substrate for urokinase (RVRL). TFP was shown to activate
      the production of matrix constituents while inhibiting Matrix MetalloProtease
      MMP-1 in vitro on fibroblasts and ex vivo on skin explants. Objective: In the
      present study, TFP properties were evaluated in a clinical assay. Methods:
      Twenty-two volunteers applied a TFP-based cream on one hemi-face and a
      placebo-based cream on the other hemi-face, twice a day during 28 days, before
      undergoing a surgical lifting. Cutometry and skin relief measurements were
      performed at days 0 and 28, and skin explants from lifting surgery were used for 
      histological analyses. Results: Cutometry and skin relief measurements reveal TFP
      firming properties and wrinkle depth decrease in 28 days on TFP- as compared to
      placebo-treated hemi-faces. These results are confirmed by histological analyses 
      showing an increase of the ratio between basal lamina and stratum corneum.
      Furthermore, immunostaining of collagen reveals a modification of the ratio
      between type I and III collagens. Conclusion: The combined analysis of phenotypic
      and histologic parameters demonstrates a reorganization of the ECM towards a
      regenerative profile upon TFP treatment.

TI  - Macrophage cell membrane-based nanoparticles: a new promising biomimetic platform
      for targeted delivery and treatment.
LID - 542
AB  - Synthetic nanoparticles with surface bioconjugation are promising platforms for
      targeted therapy, but their simple biological functionalization is still a
      challenging task against the complex intercellular environment. Once synthetic
      nanoparticles enter the body, they are phagocytosed by immune cells by the immune
      system. Recently, the cell membrane camouflage strategy has emerged as a novel
      therapeutic tactic to overcome these issues by utilizing the fundamental
      properties of natural cells. Macrophage, a type of immune system cells, plays
      critical roles in various diseases, including cancer, atherosclerosis, rheumatoid
      arthritis, infection and inflammation, due to the recognition and engulfment
      function of removing substances and pathogens. Macrophage membranes inherit the
      surface protein profiles and biointerfacing properties of source cells.
      Therefore, the macrophage membrane cloaking can protect synthetic nanoparticles
      from phagocytosis by the immune cells. Meanwhile, the macrophage membrane can
      make use of the natural correspondence to accurately recognize antigens and
      target inflamed tissue or tumor sites. In this review, we have summarized the
      advances in the fabrication, characterization and homing capacity of macrophage
      membrane cloaking nanoparticles in various diseases, including cancers, immune
      diseases, cardiovascular diseases, central nervous system diseases, and microbial
      infections. Although macrophage membrane-camouflaged nanoparticles are currently 
      in the fetal stage of development, there is huge potential and challenge to
      explore the conversion mode in the clinic.

TI  - A Completely Non-occlusive Segmental Cryoballoon Ablation for Atrial Fibrillation
      Guided by High-density Mapping: A Novel Approach and Proof of Concept.
PG  - 5259-64
AB  - Cryoballoon (CB) ablation traditionally involves obtaining pulmonary vein (PV)
      occlusion followed by pulmonary vein isolation (PVI). The therapy is guided by
      time to effect and proximity to the esophagus or phrenic nerve. This, however,
      requires segmental non-occlusive cryoablation (NOCA) to achieve PVI. While
      segmental ablation has gained popularity lately with its use during left atrial
      posterior wall ablation, occlusive PVI remains the mainstay of CB ablation. Many 
      times, this leads to distal lesions and not necessarily wide-area circumferential
      ablation (WACA) as done with radiofrequency (RF) ablation. In addition, NOCA is
      guided by estimated balloon positioning as there is no way to see the balloon on 
      the mapping system or to show the exact area of balloon contact as is achievable 
      with contact force catheters. In this case report, we show how a high-density
      mapping catheter can be used (1) to select the site of ablation on the WACA line;
      (2) to determine the anticipated location of the CB ablation lesion; (3) to
      ensure contact; (4) for high-density mapping to ensure PVI; (5) to avoid any PV
      occlusion and use of related modalities (contrast, left atrial pressure waveform,
      intracardiac echo, and color Doppler); (6) for short lesions to avoid any change 
      in esophageal temperature of effect on phrenic nerve; and (7) to achieve true
      WACA similar to as seen with RF ablation in a very predictable manner. We believe
      that this is the first case report of its kind using a high-density mapping
      catheter without an attempt made for any PV occlusion.

AB  - Pseudoenzymes resemble active enzymes, but lack key catalytic residues believed
      to be required for activity. Many pseudoenzymes appear to be inactive in
      conventional enzyme assays. However, an alternative explanation for their
      apparent lack of activity is that pseudoenzymes are being assayed for the wrong
      reaction. We have discovered several new protein kinase-like families which have 
      revealed how different binding orientations of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and
      active site residue migration can generate a novel reaction from a common kinase 
      scaffold. These results have exposed the catalytic versatility of the protein
      kinase fold and suggest that atypical kinases and pseudokinases should be
      analyzed for alternative transferase activities. In this chapter, we discuss a
      general approach for bioinformatically identifying divergent or atypical members 
      of an enzyme superfamily, then present an experimental approach to characterize
      their catalytic activity.

TI  - Efficacy of FRO on Acne Vulgaris Pathogenesis.
LID - 1885
AB  - Acne vulgaris is a common skin disease characterized by increased sebum
      production, inflammation, and Cutibacterium acnes (CA: formerly Propionibacterium
      acnes) hyperproliferation in pilosebaceous follicles. This study evaluated the
      efficacy of FRO, a formula composed of fermented Rhus verniciflua Stokes and
      Orostachys japonicus, against acne pathogenesis via antimicrobial assessment and 
      an in vitro analysis. Stimulated model cells treated with hormones, CA, or
      lipopolysaccharide (LPS) were designed based on the characteristics of acne
      pathogenesis, including inflammation and sebum hypersecretion. High-performance
      liquid chromatography, disc diffusion, MTS, and western blotting assays were used
      to examine potential anti-acne effects. FRO was determined to contain phenolics
      such as gallic acid, fisetin, quercetin, and kaempferol. FRO exerted
      antimicrobial activity against CA and inhibited reactive oxygen species
      production that was otherwise increased by LPS or CA in HaCaT cells.
      Additionally, FRO exerted anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting iNOS, TNF-α,
      IL-6, p-STAT-3, and p-NF-κB, which were previously upregulated by LPS or CA in
      THP-1 and HaCaT cells. FRO inhibited lipogenesis induced by steroid hormones and 
      CA by decreasing FAS and SREBP-1 levels in sebocytes. Additionally, FRO
      down-regulated the androgen receptor, 5α-reductase, SREBP-1, and FAS levels,
      which were upregulated by steroid hormone in LNCaP cells. Taken together, our
      findings suggest that FRO alleviates acne by inhibiting the growth of CA,
      inflammation, and excess sebum and could be used for functional cosmetics or acne
      treatments.

TI  - The Effect of the Time Interval From Sperm Processing to Intrauterine
      Insemination on the Pregnancy Outcomes of Infertile Women.
PG  - 199-204
AB  - Objective: Intrauterine insemination (IUI) is the first-line treatment in couples
      suffering from various causes of subfertility and infertility. Considering the
      relatively low rate of pregnancy achieved with each cycle in this method,
      optimizing various steps in the process including the time interval from sperm
      collection to IUI may result in an increased rate of success. The goal of this
      study was to assess the impact of time intervals from the end of sperm processing
      to IUI (SP-IUI) on the pregnancy rate in IUI.Materials and methods: This
      single-center prospective cohort study evaluated couples with normal male partner
      sperm analysis and idiopathic female infertility undergoing IUI from 2018 to
      2021. Cycles were stimulated using subcutaneous recombinant FSH and oral
      Letrozole. Ovulation was triggered using GnRH antagonist when the leading
      follicle’s size reached greater than 14mm. The participants were placed in one of
      the three groups based on SP-IUI: group 1 (0–60 min), group II (60–90 min), and
      Group III: (>90 min).Results: 269 couples were included in the study. Sperm
      processing expectedly resulted in an increased concentration of total sperm count
      and sperm motility (P<0.001). The rate of chemical or clinical pregnancy,
      abortion, IUFD, multigestation, pregnancy, term birth, and ectopic pregnancy was 
      not significantly different across study groups (P>0.05).Conclusion: The results 
      of this study suggest that SP-IUI intervals evaluated in this study do not vary
      in terms of pregnancy rate or adverse pregnancy outcomes in IUI with normal male 
      partner semen analysis. Hence, infertile couples can be flexible in the
      collection of semen specimens without time and site (at home or hospital)
      limitations.

TI  - Angiotensin-(1-7) improves cognitive function and reduces inflammation in mice
      following mild traumatic brain injury.
LID - 903980
AB  - Introduction: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading cause of disability in
      the US. Angiotensin 1-7 (Ang-1-7), an endogenous peptide, acts at the G protein
      coupled MAS1 receptors (MASR) to inhibit inflammatory mediators and decrease
      reactive oxygen species within the CNS. Few studies have identified whether
      Ang-(1-7) decreases cognitive impairment following closed TBI. This study
      examined the therapeutic effect of Ang-(1-7) on secondary injury observed in a
      murine model of mild TBI (mTBI) in a closed skull, single injury model. Materials
      and methods: Male mice (n = 108) underwent a closed skull, controlled cortical
      impact injury. Two hours after injury, mice were administered either Ang-(1-7) (n
      = 12) or vehicle (n = 12), continuing through day 5 post-TBI, and tested for
      cognitive impairment on days 1–5 and 18. pTau, Tau, GFAP, and serum cytokines
      were measured at multiple time points. Animals were observed daily for cognition 
      and motor coordination via novel object recognition. Brain sections were stained 
      and evaluated for neuronal injury. Results: Administration of Ang-(1-7) daily for
      5 days post-mTBI significantly increased cognitive function as compared to saline
      control-treated animals. Cortical and hippocampal structures showed less damage
      in the presence of Ang-(1-7), while Ang-(1-7) administration significantly
      changed the expression of pTau and GFAP in cortical and hippocampal regions as
      compared to control. Discussion: These are among the first studies to demonstrate
      that sustained administration of Ang-(1-7) following a closed-skull, single
      impact mTBI significantly improves neurologic outcomes, potentially offering a
      novel therapeutic modality for the prevention of long-term CNS impairment
      following such injuries.

TI  - Posterior wall isolation in persistent atrial fibrillation feasibility, safety,
      durability, and efficacy.
PG  - 1667-74
AB  - Introduction: Posterior wall isolation (PWI) added to pulmonary vein isolation
      (PVI) is increasingly used despite limited evidence of clinical benefit. We
      investigated the feasibility, durability, and efficacy of index‐procedure
      PVI + PWI radio frequency ablation (RFA) in patients with persistent atrial
      fibrillation (PeAF). Methods and Results: Twenty‐four patients with PeAF
      participated in the prospective PeAF‐Box study and underwent RFA with wide area
      circumferential ablation, roof‐ and inferior lines to achieve PVI + PWI at index 
      procedure. Follow‐up included monitoring by an implantable cardiac monitor,
      esophagoscopy and mandated invasive lesion‐reassessment at 6 months. PWI was
      achieved at minor procedural cost in all patients following PVI. In 33% of
      patients a median of three ablations in the narrow zone between the center of the
      posterior wall (PW) and the posterior right carina was pivotal for swift
      achievement of PWI. At the 6‐month reassessment procedure 85% (95% confidence
      interval [CI]: 77%–92%) of pulmonary veins (PVs) and 46% (95% CI: 26%–67%) of PWs
      remained durably isolated. AF recurred in 25% and was associated with
      PV‐reconnection (p = .02) but not PW‐reconnection (p = .27). AF‐burden was 0%
      (interquartile range [IQR]: 0%–0%) overall and after recurrence 1% (IQR: 0%–7%). 
      Conclusion: Index procedure PVI + PWI for PeAF was feasible when recognizing that
      limited ablation in a PW center‐to‐right‐carina zone was required in a subset of 
      patients. Despite limited chronic PWI durability this strategy was followed by
      low AF‐burden. A PVI + PWI strategy appears promising in ablation for PeAF.

      clinical perspectives.
LID - 222
AB  - Cancer is one of the significant threats to human life. Although various latest
      technologies are currently available to treat cancer, it still accounts for
      millions of death each year worldwide. Thus, creating a need for more developed
      and novel technologies to combat this deadly condition. Nanoparticles-based
      cancer therapeutics have offered a promising approach to treat cancer effectively
      while minimizing adverse events. Among various nanoparticles, nanogold (AuNPs)
      are biocompatible and have proved their efficiency in treating cancer because
      they can reach tumors via enhanced permeability and retention effect. The size
      and shape of the AuNPs are responsible for their diverse therapeutic behavior.
      Thus, to modulate their therapeutic values, the AuNPs can be synthesized in
      various shapes, such as spheres, cages, flowers, shells, prisms, rods, clusters, 
      etc. Also, attaching AuNPs with single or multiple targeting agents can
      facilitate the active targeting of AuNPs to the tumor tissue. The AuNPs have been
      much explored for photothermal therapy (PTT) to treat cancer. In addition to PTT,
      AuNPs-based nanoplatforms have been investigated for combinational multimodal
      therapies in the last few years, including photodynamic therapy, chemotherapy,
      radiotherapy, immunotherapy, etc., to ablate cancer cells. Thus, the present
      review focuses on the recent advancements in the functionalization of AuNPs-based
      nanoconstructs for cancer imaging and therapy using combinatorial multimodal
      approaches to treat various cancers.Graphical Abstract:

      dog.
PG  - 1460-4
AB  - The objective of this case report is to describe the use of extracorporeal
      therapy, specifically hemodialfiltration, for the treatment of caffeine
      intoxication. A 12 year old Border Terrier consumed up to 1440 mg/kg of caffeine 
      and rapidly developed clinical signs of tachycardia and tremors.
      Hemodiafiltration was instituted, using an M60 PrismaFlex cartridge using blood
      to prime the system due to patient size. Treatment with 11.25 L of therapy fluid 
      (83% dialysate, 17% replacement fluid), or 1.8 L/kg, was provided over 6 h.
      Pre‐treatment serum caffeine concentration of 233 µg/mL was decreased by 89% to
      25 µg/nL by the end of treatment. Despite prompt institution of extracorporeal
      toxin removal therapy, ventricular ectopy developed necessitating sotolol
      treatment for the following week. Caffeine is efficiently removed via
      hemodialysis, as predicted by small size, small volume of distribution, and
      minimal protein binding. A CRRT platform can be used to provide adequate
      clearance.

LID - 321
AB  - Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common complication after acute myocardial
      infarction (AMI) in clinical practice, and the majority of previous preclinical
      models were induced by a single factor. The objective of the present study was to
      establish a stable preclinic model of AKI induced by contrast media (CM) with
      acute myocardial ischemia reperfusion surgery and to identify the effect of
      oxidative stress on kidney injury. Rats were treated individually or with CM or
      myocardial ischemia reperfusion surgery. Renal baseline and AKI parameters, the
      level of oxidative stress and histopathological images were examined along with
      AKI biomarkers. Results showed the incidence of AKI in the CM group and ischemia 
      reperfusion injury (IRI) group was 40%, χ2 test (P<0.05 vs. CM-IRI) and 35%, χ2
      test (P<0.05 vs. CM-IRI) and the combination group had the highest incidence rate
      75%. IRI surgery combined with CM diminished kidney function and induced
      oxidative stress by increasing creatinine, blood urea nitrogen and reactive
      oxygen species levels. Western blotting showed that the early AKI biomarker of
      NGAL and KIM-1 increased and that the combination group had the highest value.
      Pathology damage exhibited severe kidney damage in the combination group compared
      with other control groups. The present research established a reliable preclinic 
      model of post-AMI AKI with a stable and high postoperative AKI rate.
      Additionally, CM was demonstrated to exacerbate AKI caused by acute myocardial
      infarction through oxidative stress and, thus, oxidative stress may be a
      potential therapeutic target.

TI  - Control of actin polymerization via reactive oxygen species generation using
      light or radiation.
LID - 1014008
AB  - Actin is one of the most prevalent proteins in cells, and its amino acid sequence
      is remarkably conserved from protozoa to humans. The
      polymerization-depolymerization cycle of actin immediately below the plasma
      membrane regulates cell function, motility, and morphology. It is known that
      actin and other actin-binding proteins are targets for reactive oxygen species
      (ROS), indicating that ROS affects cells through actin reorganization. Several
      researchers have attempted to control actin polymerization from outside the cell 
      to mimic or inhibit actin reorganization. To modify the polymerization state of
      actin, ultraviolet, visible, and near-infrared light, ionizing radiation, and
      chromophore-assisted light inactivation have all been reported to induce ROS.
      Additionally, a combination of the fluorescent protein KillerRed and the
      luminescent protein luciferase can generate ROS on actin fibers and promote actin
      polymerization. These techniques are very useful tools for analyzing the
      relationship between ROS and cell function, movement, and morphology, and are
      also expected to be used in therapeutics. In this mini review, we offer an
      overview of the advancements in this field, with a particular focus on how to
      control intracellular actin polymerization using such optical approaches, and
      discuss future challenges.

TI  - 3D-printed heart models for hands-on training in pediatric cardiology – the
      future of modern learning and teaching?
LID - Doc23
AB  - Background: : This project aims to develop a new concept in training pediatric
      cardiologists to meet the requirements of interventional cardiac catheterizations
      today in terms of complexity and importance. This newly developed hands-on
      training program is supposed to enable the acquisition of certain skills which
      are necessary when investigating and treating patients in a catheter laboratory. 
      Methods: : Based on anonymous CT-scans of pediatric patients’ digital 3D heart
      models with or without cardiac defects were developed and printed
      three-dimensionally in a flexible material visible under X-ray. Hands-on training
      courses were offered using models of a healthy heart and the most common
      congenital heart defects (CHD). An evaluation was performed by quantifying
      fluoroscopy times (FL-time) and a questionnaire. Results: : The acceptance of
      theoretical and practical contents within the hands-on training was very
      positive. It was demonstrated that it is possible to master various steps of a
      diagnostic procedure and an intervention as well as to practice and repeat them
      independently which significantly reduced FL-time. The participants stated that
      the hands-on training led to more confidence in interventions on real patients.
      Conclusion: : With the development of a training module using 3D-printed heart
      models, basic and advanced training in the field of diagnostic cardiac
      examinations as well as interventional therapies of CHD is possible. The learning
      effect for both, practical skills and theoretical understanding, was significant 
      which underlines the importance of integrating such hands-on trainings on 3D
      heart models in education and practical training.

TI  - Caveolin-1 in endothelial cells: A potential therapeutic target for
      atherosclerosis.
LID - e18653
AB  - Atherosclerosis (AS) is a chronic vascular disease characterized by lipid
      accumulation and the activation of the inflammatory response; it remains the
      leading nation-wide cause of death. Early in the progression of AS, stimulation
      by pro-inflammatory agonists (TNF-α, LPS, and others), oxidized lipoproteins
      (ox-LDL), and biomechanical stimuli (low shear stress) lead to endothelial cell
      activation and dysfunction. Consequently, it is crucial to investigate how
      endothelial cells respond to different stressors and ways to alter endothelial
      cell activation in AS development, as they are the earliest cells to respond.
      Caveolin-1 (Cav1) is a 21-24-kDa membrane protein located in caveolae and highly 
      expressed in endothelial cells, which plays a vital role in regulating lipid
      transport, inflammatory responses, and various cellular signaling pathways and
      has atherogenic effects. This review summarizes recent studies on the structure
      and physiological functions of Cav1 and outlines the potential mechanisms it
      mediates in AS development. Included are the roles of Cav1 in the regulation of
      endothelial cell autophagy, response to shear stress, modulation of the eNOS/NO
      axis, and transduction of inflammatory signaling pathways. This review provides a
      rationale for proposing Cav1 as a novel target for the prevention of AS, as well 
      as new ideas for therapeutic strategies for early AS.

TI  - Feasibility of Very Early Identification of Cardiogenic Shock by Semi-automated
      Ultrasound Exam in the Emergency Department.
LID - e30927
AB  - BackgroundCardiogenic shock (CS) is critical end-organ hypoperfusion due to
      reduced cardiac output. Early therapy, such as vasoactive agents or the
      initiation of mechanical circulatory support (MCS), requires early diagnosis and 
      is associated with better outcomes. A novel ultrasound platform (GE Healthcare,
      Milwaukee, WI) has semi-automated imaging software (SAIS), which could simplify
      the point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) diagnosis of CS. We assessed the feasibility
      of using POCUS with SAIS in patients in shock, determined the ability of SAIS to 
      identify the subset of patients with CS, and described the process and outcome of
      care of patients with vs. without CS after presenting to Emergency Department
      (ED) with hypotension.MethodsThis prospective case-control study was conducted at
      an urban ED. Physicians with prior POCUS education received one hour of training 
      with the study device. The qualitative ejection fraction was determined by visual
      assessment. SAIS measurements of hemodynamics were made with the study device and
      included left ventricle outflow tract velocity time integral (LVOT VTI), inferior
      vena cava collapsibility or distensibility indices, and pulmonary B-line
      assessment. ED patients with a systolic blood pressure ≤ 90 mmHg or need for a
      vasopressor initiation in the ED were enrolled. The diagnosis of CS was
      determined by a medical record review. All data were summarized
      descriptively.ResultsTwenty-nine cases underwent POCUS, and 87 controls did not. 
      Baseline characteristics, process, and outcome of care were similar between
      groups. Seventy-nine percent (79%) of cases had a complete POCUS with SAIS. Of
      these, 55% had reduced LVOT VTI, 38% had IVC collapsibility <50%, and 48% of
      cases had a B-line pattern consistent with pulmonary edema. The mean LVOT VTI for
      cases with CS was 9.4± 5.4 cm; the mean LVOT VTI for cases without CS was 15.2 ± 
      6.0 cm. Among patients who did not undergo POCUS, 31 (36%) had a formal
      echocardiogram, and eight (9%) had a final diagnosis of cardiogenic shock during 
      hospitalization.ConclusionPhysicians with one hour of platform-specific training 
      were able to implement POCUS with SAIS among patients who present with shock.
      POCUS with SAIS may aid in the early recognition of CS.

TI  - Micro- and Nanosized Carriers for Nose-to-Brain Drug Delivery in
      Neurodegenerative Disorders.
LID - 1706
AB  - Neurodegenerative disorders (NDs) have become a serious health problem worldwide 
      due to the rapid increase in the number of people that are affected and the
      constantly aging population. Among all NDs, Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease
      are the most common, and many efforts have been made in the development of
      effective and reliable therapeutic strategies. The intranasal route of drug
      administration offers numerous advantages, such as bypassing the blood–brain
      barrier and providing a direct entrance to the brain through the olfactory and
      trigeminal neurons. The present review summarizes the available information on
      recent advances in micro- and nanoscale nose-to-brain drug-delivery systems as a 
      novel strategy for the treatment of Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease.
      Specifically, polymer- and lipid-base micro- and nanoparticles have been studied 
      as a feasible approach to increase the brain bioavailability of certain drugs.
      Furthermore, nanocomposites are discussed as a suitable formulation for
      administration into the nasal cavity.

TI  - Acute Pulmonary Edema and NSTEMI.
PG  - O1-O32
AB  - Audience: Emergency medicine residents and medical students on emergency medicine
      rotation. Introduction: Acute pulmonary edema is a common and potentially fatal
      presentation in the emergency department. More than 1 million patients are
      admitted annually with a diagnosis of pulmonary edema secondary to cardiac
      causes.1 Pulmonary edema is broadly split into two main categories: cardiogenic
      and noncardiogenic. Cardiogenic pulmonary edema is characterized by acute dyspnea
      caused by the accumulation of fluid within the lung’s interstitial and/or
      alveolar spaces, which is the result of acutely elevated cardiac filling
      pressures.2 Noncardiogenic pulmonary edema is characterized by fluid accumulation
      within the alveolar space in the absence of elevated pulmonary capillary wedge
      pressure.2 These patients often present critically ill, and rapid identification 
      and aggressive management is paramount in caring for patients with pulmonary
      edema. Dyspnea is the most common presentation with a sensitivity of 89% but a
      low specificity of 51%.3 Workup of pulmonary edema often includes laboratory
      testing, electrocardiogram (EKG), chest x-ray (CXR), and often bedside ultrasound
      (US) and echocardiography.4 Pulmonary edema management depends on the etiology
      but is often focused on preload and afterload reduction. Diuretics, nitrates, and
      optimizing ventilatory support through non-invasive and invasive strategies are
      the mainstay of treatment. Educational Objectives: At the end of this practice
      oral boards case, the learner will:1) recognize unstable vital signs (VS) and
      intervene to stabilize ventilation and oxygenation, 2) demonstrate the ability to
      obtain a complete medical history including the important characteristics of
      chest pain, 3) demonstrate an appropriate exam on a patient, 4) order the
      appropriate evaluation studies for a patient with complaints of dyspnea, 5)
      interpret the results of diagnostic evaluation and diagnose Non- ST elevation
      myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and pulmonary edema, 6) order appropriate
      management of pulmonary edema and NSTEMI, and 6) demonstrate effective
      communication with patient and family members. Educational Methods: Practice oral
      boards Research Methods: Immediate Feedback was solicited from the learners and
      observers participating in the case both by verbal discussion and completion of a
      rating for the case following the debriefing. The efficacy of the educational
      content was assessed by comparing scoring measures across residents based on the 
      training year. Scoring measures of the American College of Graduate Medical
      Education (ACGME) core competencies were performed using a scale from 1 – 8, 1–4 
      being unacceptable performance and 5 – 8 being acceptable. Efficacy was assumed
      based on full completion of the case by the residents who acted as practice oral 
      board candidates, and a debriefing session followed to discuss the key components
      of the case. Results: This case was presented to twelve Emergency Medicine
      Residents, seven PGY 1 and five PGY 2 at a relatively new residency program. The 
      overall average score for the residents was 5.62. The PGY 1 Residents’ average on
      the case was 5.56, and the average for the PGY 2 Residents was slightly better at
      5.70. The slight improvement noted by the PGY 2 Residents is likely attributable 
      to more clinical experience; however, both classes did not have any prior
      exposure to the oral board format until this simulated experience. Six residents 
      completed all critical actions in the case. Of those who missed a critical
      action, failing to diagnose NSTEMI and consulting cardiology were the most
      common. All learners found educational value in the case with an overall rating
      of 4.83 (1–5 Likert scale, 5 being excellent). Discussion: Acute pulmonary edema 
      and NSTEMI are common diagnoses that will be frequently encountered for most
      emergency physicians. This case highlights the need for early identification and 
      aggressive management of the patient presenting with respiratory distress. The
      differential for respiratory distress is large, but most learners were able to
      quickly identify pulmonary edema based on the exam findings of jugular vein
      distention (JVD), rales, and lower extremity edema. Most learners quickly
      escalated to a non-rebreather mask and ultimately to BPAP (bilevel positive
      airway pressure) without requesting to intubate the patient. There was notable
      variation in the approach to administering nitrates, but most ordered an
      intravenous (IV) nitroglycerin (NTG) drip and requested pharmacy assistance in
      dosing. Diuretics were ordered by all the learners, but some were hesitant to
      start early because they felt the effect would be delayed. Some of the residents 
      did not identify ischemic changes on the EKG at first glance but did request to
      review a second time when the troponin result was positive. All residents gave
      aspirin after noting the positive troponin, but not all were able to make a clear
      diagnosis of NSTEMI or consult cardiology. Although the case was relatively
      straightforward, residents enjoyed early diagnosis and aggressive management of
      the patient with impending respiratory failure. Many residents are asking for an 
      ultrasound early in the workup of this patient presenting in respiratory
      distress. Although not a critical action in this case, it highlights the emphasis
      placed on ultrasonography in the current emergency medicine curriculum. Topics:
      Pulmonary Edema, Cardiovascular emergencies, NSTEMI.

TI  - Comparison of continuous transmuscular quadratus lumborum block and continuous
      psoas compartment block for posterior total hip arthroplasty: A randomised
      controlled trial.
PG  - 530-6
AB  - Background and Aims:: Analgesia for hip surgery involves cutaneous anaesthesia at
      the site of the skin incision and the anterior hip capsule. This study aimed to
      compare continuous ultrasound (US)-guided transmuscular quadratus lumborum block 
      (TQLB) with psoas compartment block (PCB) for analgesia in patients undergoing
      total hip arthroplasty (THA) under general anaesthesia (GA). Methods:: This
      randomised, observer-blinded trial included 18–70-year-old American Society of
      Anesthesiologists physical status I–III patients undergoing THA under GA with
      either US-guided continuous TQLB or PCB. Primary objectives included a visual
      analogue scale (VAS; 0–100 mm) at rest and mobilisation at 6 h postoperatively
      (analysed by intention to treat and per protocol) using a non-inferiority margin 
      of 20 mm. Secondary objectives included VAS at other time points, 24-h fentanyl
      consumption (analysed using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test), sensory dermatomes
      anaesthetised, motor weakness 30 min after block, and haemodynamic response to
      skin incision (analysed using the Chi-squared or Fisher’s exact test). A P value 
      less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results:: VAS (0-100 mm)
      score at 6 h on rest was 25.34 ± 14.25 and 27.3 ± 9.6, mean difference (MD) was
      1.9 [−3.3, 7.1] and at movement was 35.1 ± 23.0 and 38.6 ± 17.0, MD was 3.5
      [−5.2, 12.2], in the PCB (n = 29) and QLB (n = 30) groups, respectively (i.e.
      less than the non-inferiority margin). However, VAS (rest) at 1, 12, and 24 h
      postoperatively and median (IQR) 24-h fentanyl consumption was significantly
      higher in the QLB group (1212.5 [300–2345] μg] when compared to the PCB group
      (635 [100–1645] μg; P = 0.0004). Conclusion:: Though statistically, continuous
      QLB was non-inferior to continuous PCB for pain at rest and mobilisation at
      6-hours postoperatively, a higher 24-hour perioperative fentanyl consumption and 
      VAS show that QLB was clinically inferior to PCB.

TI  - The ‘Ironclad friendship’ of China-Cambodia, lays the first step in the
      foundation of early diagnosis and treatment of asymptomatic congenital heart
      Defects- A multi-national screening and intervention project, 2017–2020.
LID - 288
AB  - Background: Congenital heart disease (CHD) is the leading cause of mortality in
      childhood worldwide. However, a large number of children with CHD are not
      diagnosed promptly in low- and middle-income regions, due to limited healthcare
      resources and lack the ability of prenatal and postnatal ultrasound examinations.
      The research on asymptomatic CHD in the community is still blank, resulting in a 
      large number of children with asymptomatic CHD can not be found and treated in
      time. Through the China-Cambodia collaborative health care initiative, the
      project team conducted research, screened children’s CHD through a sampling
      survey in China and Cambodia, collected relevant data, and retrospectively
      analyzed the data of all eligible patients. Objectives: The project aimed to
      evaluate the prevalence of asymptomatic CHD in a sample population of 3-18years
      old and effects on their growth status and treatment outcomes. Methods: We
      examined the prevalence of ‘asymptomatic CHD’ among 3-18years old children and
      adolescents at the township/county levels in the two participating. A total of
      eight provinces in China and five provinces in Cambodia were analyzed from 2017
      to 2020. During 1 year follow-up after treatment, the differences in heights and 
      weights of the treated and control groups were evaluated. Results: Among the
      3,068,075 participants screened from 2017 to 2020, 3967 patients with
      asymptomatic CHD requiring treatment were identified [0.130%, 95% confidence
      interval (CI) 0.126 -0.134%]. The prevalence rate of CHD ranged from 0.02 to
      0.88%, and was negatively related to local per capita GDP (p = 0.028). The
      average height of 3310 treated CHD patients were 2.23% (95% CI: -2.51%~-1.9%)
      lower than that of the standard group and the average weight was − 6.41% (95% CI:
      -7.17%~-5.65%) lower, the developmental gap widening with advancing age. One year
      after treatment, the relative height difference remained comparable while that,
      in weight was reduced by 5.68% (95% CI: 4.27% ~7.09%). Conclusions: Asymptomatic 
      CHD now is often overlooked and is an emerging public health challenge. Early
      detection and treatment are essential to lower the potential burden of heart
      diseases in children and adolescents. Supplementary Information: The online

TI  - Long-term outcomes following ostial left anterior descending artery intervention 
      with or without crossover to left-main.
PG  - 73-80
AB  - Background: Ostial left anterior descending (LAD) artery lesions are a critical
      area for coronary stenting, given that the location subtends a large area of the 
      myocardium and can also be more technically challenging. It remains controversial
      whether crossover stenting of ostial LAD back into the left-main (LM) is
      advantageous over stenting the ostium alone. Methods: To evaluate the long-term
      clinical outcomes of stenting ostial LAD lesions, we retrospectively reviewed all
      ostial LAD lesions cases at QEII Health Science Centre between 2008 and 2018.
      Specifically, we compared the outcomes in those patients that had left main stent
      crossover vs. ostial stenting (OS) alone. Results: The total number of patients
      included in the study was 175, with 25 patients (14%) having a crossover to the
      LM and 150 (86%) having OS. There were more patients with previous CABG (24%) in 
      the crossover group compared to the OS group (9.2%) (P = 0.042). The one-year
      MACE was not significantly different between CO vs. OS (13.3% (10.5-16.1) vs. 12%
      (5.5-18.5)). The five-year MACE was numerically higher, although statistically
      not significant, in CO vs. OS (19.3 (15.9-22.7) vs. 25.9 (16.6-35.2)).
      Conclusion: This study shows that percutaneous intervention provides reasonable
      long-term outcomes and low rates of repeat revascularization for isolated ostial 
      LAD lesions, with no noticeable difference in outcomes with crossover stenting
      into the LM vs. OS alone. A larger, prospective study may be required to
      determine the optimal strategy for treating ostial LAD lesions.

LID - e01738
AB  - Gordonia is a rarely reported organism causing central line-associated
      bloodstream infection (CLABSI). This article reports an acute myeloid leukemia
      (AML) case in which the patient developed febrile neutropenia and was later found
      to have Gordonia bronchialis (G. bronchialis) CLABSI. The patient received a
      two-week ceftriaxone regimen, based on susceptibility. The microbiologic
      diagnosis of this organism is considered challenging due to its resemblance with 
      other organisms; however, more sophisticated methods of diagnosis (such as gene
      sequencing) can aid in differentiation.

TI  - Dapagliflozin Prevents High-Glucose-Induced Cellular Senescence in Renal Tubular 
      Epithelial Cells.
LID - 16107
AB  - Gliflozins are a new class of antidiabetic drugs with renoprotective properties. 
      In cultures of primary human renal tubular epithelial cells (RPTECs) subjected to
      high-glucose conditions in the presence or absence of dapagliflozin, we evaluated
      cellular senescence pathways. High glucose increased sodium–glucose
      cotransporter-2 (SGLT-2) expression and glucose consumption, enhancing reactive
      oxygen species production. The latter induced DNA damage, ataxia telangiectasia
      mutated kinase (ATM), and p53 phosphorylation. Stabilized p53 increased the cell 
      cycle inhibitor p21, resulting in cell cycle arrest and increasing the cellular
      senescence marker beta-galactosidase (GLB-1). RPTECs under high glucose acquired 
      a senescence-associated secretory phenotype, which was detected by the production
      of IL-1β, IL-8, and TGF-β1. By decreasing SGLT-2 expression and glucose
      consumption, dapagliflozin inhibited the above pathway and prevented RPTEC
      senescence. In addition, dapagliflozin reduced the cell cycle inhibitor p16
      independently of the glucose conditions. Neither glucose concentration nor
      dapagliflozin affected the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition when assessed
      with α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA). Thus, high glucose induces p21-dependent
      RPTEC senescence, whereas dapagliflozin prevents it. Since cellular senescence
      contributes to the pathogenesis of diabetic nephropathy, delineating the related 
      molecular mechanisms and the effects of the widely used gliflozins on them is of 
      particular interest and may lead to novel therapeutic approaches.

TI  - Podocyturia: an earlier biomarker of cardiovascular outcomes.
LID - 21563
AB  - Urinary podocin and nephrin mRNAs (podocyturia), as candidate biomarkers of
      endothelial/podocyte injury, were measured by quantitative PCR in Type II
      diabetics with normal albumin excretion rates (AER) at baseline, at 3–4 years,
      and at 7 years. Development of cardiovascular disease (CVD) was collected as
      outcome. Visit 1 podocyturia was significantly higher in subjects who
      subsequently developed CVD versus those who did not. Visit 1 AER terciles
      exhibited similar time to CVD, in contrast with stepwise and substantial
      increases in CVD events predicted by Visit 1 podocyturia terciles.
      Covariate-adjusted hazard ratios were highest for podocin, intermediate for
      nephrin mRNAs, and lowest for AER. Podocyturia was also measured in patients with
      and without significant coronary obstruction, and in 480 normoalbuminuric
      subjects at the enrolment visit to the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis
      (MESA). Podocyturia > 3 × 106 copies was associated with presence of obstructive 
      coronary artery disease. In the MESA population, Visit 1 podocyturia was
      significantly higher in men, subjects with elevated BMI, and those with Type II
      DM. Conclusions: Podocyturia may be an earlier predictor of cardiovascular events
      than moderate albuminuria; it is significantly higher in patients with
      obstructive coronary artery disease, and in subjects with established risk
      factors for CVD.

      Determination of Target Molecules in Spain.

AB  - Over the last decades, an increasing demand for new specific molecular
      recognition elements has emerged in order to improve analytical methods that have
      already been developed in order to reach the detection/quantification limits of
      target molecules. Molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) have molecular
      recognition abilities provided by the presence of a template molecule during
      their synthesis, and they are excellent materials with high selectivity for
      sample preparation. These synthetic polymers are relatively easy to prepare, and 
      they can also be an excellent choice in the substitution of antibodies or enzymes
      in different kinds of assays. They have been properly applied to the development 
      of chromatographic or solid-phase extraction methods and have also been
      successfully applied as electrochemical, piezoelectrical, and optical sensors, as
      well as in the catalysis process. Nevertheless, new formats of polymerization can
      also provide new applications for these materials. This paper provides a
      comprehensive comparison of the new challenges in molecular imprinting as
      materials of the future in Spain.
