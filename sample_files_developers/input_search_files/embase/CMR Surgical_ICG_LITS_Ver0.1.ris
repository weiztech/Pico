N2  - Background: The advantages of photodynamic diagnostic technology using 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA-PDD) have been established. The aim of this prospective cohort study was to evaluate the usefulness of ALA-PDD to diagnose upper tract urothelial carcinoma (UT-UC) using the Olympus VISERA ELITE video system. Methods: We carried out a prospective, interventional, non-randomized, non-contrast and open label cohort pilot study that involved patients who underwent ureterorenoscopy (URS) to detect UT-UC. 5-aminolevulinic acid hydrochloride was orally administered before URS. The observational results and pathological diagnosis with ALA-PDD and traditional white light methods were compared, and the proportion of positive subjects and specimens were calculated. Results: A total of 20 patients were enrolled and one patient who had multiple bladder tumors did not undergo URS. Fifteen of 19 patients were pathologically diagnosed with UT-UC and of these 11 (73.3%) were ALA-PDD positive. Fourteen of 19 patients were ALA-PDD positive and of these 11 were pathologically diagnosed with UC. For the 92 biopsy specimens that were malignant or benign, the sensitivity for both traditional white light observation and ALA-PDD was the same at 62.5%, whereas the specificities were 73.1% and 67.3%, respectively. Of the 38 specimens that were randomly biopsied without any abnormality under examination by both white light and ALA-PDD, 11 specimens (28.9%) from 5 patients were diagnosed with high grade UC. In contrast, four specimens from 4 patients, which were negative in traditional white light observation but positive in ALA-PDD, were diagnosed with carcinoma in situ (CIS). Conclusions: Our results suggest that ALA-PDD using VISERA ELITE is not sufficiently applicable for UT-UC. Nevertheless, it might be better particularly for CIS than white light and superior results would be obtained using VISERA ELITE II video system. Trial registration: The present clinical study was approved by the Okayama University Institutional Review Board prior to study initiation (Application no.: RIN 1803–002) and was registered with the UMIN Clinical Trials Registry (UMIN-CTR), Japan (Accession no.: UMIN000031205).

N2  - Objective: This study aimed to investigate risk factors predictive of local recurrence and/or lymph node metastasis after transoral resection of early hypopharyngeal cancer. Methods: Forty-nine consecutive patients who underwent transoral videolaryngoscopic surgery (TOVS) as an initial treatment for hypopharyngeal cancer were evaluated. On univariate and multivariate analysis, local recurrence rates were assessed respectively using log-rank test and cox regression analysis according to the following parameters: subsite, pT, mucosal margin, lymphatic invasion, vessel invasion, tumor thickness (> 4 mm vs ≤4 mm), history of esophageal cancer, and multiple Lugol-voiding lesions (LVLs) in the esophagus. Categorical variables were evaluated for their associations with lymph node metastasis using chi-squared test or Fisher's exact test. Result: The subsites of primary lesions were piriform sinus in 24 patients, posterior wall in 15 patients, and postcricoid in 10 patients. Thirty patients had esophageal cancer. Local recurrence occurred in 14 patients. Three patients had lymph node metastasis at the time of diagnosis and four patients developed lymph node metastasis after the initial treatment, resulting a total of seven patients having lymph node metastasis. While mucosal margin and LVLs showed significant associations with local recurrence on univariate analysis, only LVLs remained as a significant risk factor on multivariate analysis (P =.0395; hazard ratio = 8.897; 95% confidence interval, 1.113-71.15). Most cases of local recurrence were satisfactorily controlled by repeated TOVS. While multivariate analysis could not be performed due to the small number of the patients with lymph node metastases, venous invasion (P =.0166) and tumor thickness (P =.0092) were significantly associated with lymph node metastasis on univariate analysis. Conclusions: Local recurrence was more frequent in patients with LVLs, but most of them were salvaged by repeated TOVS. Patients with venous invasion and/or tumor thickness greater than 4 mm should be followed up with special attention to lymph node metastasis. Level of Evidence: 3.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The aim of the present study was to describe our totally intracorporeal robotic ileal ureter replacement technique, reporting perioperative and mid-term results and compare it with previous similar experiences, specifically focusing on technical considerations. METHODS: Three patients were submitted to robotic ileal ureter substitution for long ureteral defects in our institution during 2019. The procedures were carried out fully intracorporeally. Two patients received a complete replacement of the urinary tract using an ileal segment, while in one patient the lower ureteral stump was maintained, and an ileal-ureter anastomosis was performed distally. Patients’ baseline characteristics, as well as perioperative and mid-term results were collected. A detailed description of the technique is reported and compared with prior similar experiences. RESULTS: Median operative time was 270 (range 240-300) min. No Clavien-Dindo complication >2 was collected. All patients experienced a fast return to oral intake and canalization. Antegrade pyelography, performed a 1-month follow-up, revealed full passage of the medium contrast in those patients submitted to complete ileal ureter replacement while, in the third one, stenosis at the level of ileal-ureter anastomoses was found. CONCLUSIONS: Robotic ileal ureter replacement can be performed completely intracorporeal with optimal results and limited complication rate, in selected cases. According to our considerations, specific surgical steps are needed to reduce the risks related to this procedure, including avoiding partial ileal substitution.

N2  - Ureteral injury can occur during total laparoscopic hysterectomy. This report documents our experience in using the near-infrared ray catheter (NIRC), a newly developed fluorescent ureteral catheter made of material that contains a fluorescent dye to improve visualization of the ureters. We have used the device in 3 patients between 40 and 50 years of age (mean, 46.3 ± 4.5 years) undergoing total laparoscopic hysterectomy and bilateral salpingectomy for uterine myomas. The time of catheter insertion ranged from 4 minutes and 9 seconds to 10 minutes and 57 seconds. A number of intraoperative procedures were performed near the ureters, namely, identification and ligation of the uterine arteries, dissection of the cardinal ligament, incision of the vaginal canal, and suturing of the vaginal stump. The abovementioned fluorescent ureteral catheter appears green on a monitor when illuminated by near-infrared light, and this facilitated real-time confirmation of the ureter positions, increasing surgical safety. The patients were followed up for 6 months postoperatively, and no urinary tract infection or injury was found. Prophylactic use of the fluorescent ureteral catheter may improve visualization of the ureters in patients considered to be at high risk of ureteral injury, such as those expected to exhibit ureteral deviation due to severe adhesions or an enlarged uterus and when the surgeon has little experience in laparoscopic surgery.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: Robotic lung resections (RLRs) are conventionally performed using look-up views of the thorax from the caudal side. To conduct RLR with views similar to those in open thoracotomy, we adopted a vertical port placement and confronting upside-down monitor setting, which we called robotic 'open-thoracotomy-view approach'. We herein present our experience of this procedure. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 58 patients who underwent RLR (43 with lobectomy; 15 with segmentectomy) with 3-arm open-thoracotomy-view approach using the da Vinci Surgical System between February 2019 and October 2020. The patient cart was rolled in from the left cranial side of the patient regardless of the side to be operated on. Robotic ports were vertically placed along the axillary line, and 2 confronting monitors and 2 assistants were positioned on each side of the patient. The right-side monitor, which was set up for the left-side assistant to view, projected the upside-down image of the console surgeon's view. RESULTS: All procedures were safely performed. The median duration of surgery and console operation was 215 and 164 min, respectively. Emergency conversion into thoracotomy and severe morbidities did not occur, and the median postoperative hospitalization duration was 3 days. In all procedures, the console surgeon and 2 assistants had direct 'bird-eye' views of the cranially located intrathoracic structures and instrument tips, which are sometimes undetectable with the conventional look-up view. CONCLUSIONS: The open-thoracotomy-view approach setting is a possible option for RLR. It offers natural thoracotomy views and can circumvent some of the known limitations of the conventional procedure.

N2  - We report hereby two cases of fluorescence-guided surgical resection with Indocyanine green in vulvo-vaginal neoplasia. The first case was a 86-year old patient who had a high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion of the left small lip and on the vulvar fork. After a first incomplete surgery, a second fluorescence-guided vulvectomy was performed with ICG injected intravenously to determine intraoperatively surgical margins. At final pathologic examination, surgical margins were free of disease and postoperative course was uneventful. The second case was a 44-year old patient who had a clear cell carcinoma of the upper vagina. She underwent a fluorescence-guided colpo-hysterectomy with pelvic lymphadenectomy. ICG was injected one centimeter around the tumor and highlighted intraoperatively the limits of the vaginal resection. On the specimens, surgical margins were also negative. Peritumoral or intravenous injection of ICG are promising techniques for the intraoperative identification of surgical margins in gynecologic malignancies.

N2  - Virtual-assisted lung mapping is a bronchoscopic multiple dye marking technique that facilitates sublobar lung resections for unidentifiable pulmonary tumors. Marking failure reportedly occurs in 10% of cases. To overcome this limitation, we developed indocyanine green virtual-assisted lung mapping that uses indocyanine green in addition to indigo carmine. Here, we report our initial experience of indocyanine green virtual-assisted lung mapping.

N2  - Objective: To report on the application of the 3D exoscopic system to microsurgery in a cohort of head and neck cancer patients; to analyse the performance of microvascular anastomoses, flap harvesting and insetting under exoscopic view and to evaluate the surgeon's feedback after procedures. Methods: An observational study was performed on 10 consecutive patients undergoing exoscopic microsurgical free flap reconstruction. The VITOM 3D system was applied to all procedures for microsurgical anastomoses, flap harvesting and insetting. Data about the type of resection and reconstruction, intraoperative and post-operative complications were recorded. Surgeon's feedback on exoscopic experience was collected through a questionnaire. Results: Reconstruction after oncologic demolition was performed by radial forearm flap in 3 cases (30%), antero-lateral thigh flap in 4 cases (40%), composite fibula flap in 2 cases (20%) and chimeric scapula flap in 1 case (10%). The mean surgical time for the microsurgical anastomoses (1 vein and 1 artery) was 34 min (range: 32–38). No intraoperative complications occurred and only two patients experienced pharyngo-cutaneous fistula in the post-operative time. There were neither cases of loss of flap, nor need of surgical revision. None of the cases had to be converted to OM technique. The surgeon never experienced back/neck pain, headache and nausea/vertigo. Occasionally, he felt tired and stressed and he reported eyestrain after one procedure only. Conclusions: VITOM 3D is easy to apply in the field of head and neck microsurgery and provides optimal stereoscopic view and anatomical details. Further studies are needed to validate indications and advantages of 3D exoscope as compared to OM.

N2  - Background: An aberrant left hepatic artery is frequently encountered during upper gastrointestinal surgery, and researchers have yet to propose optimal strategies with which to address this arterial variation. The objective of this study was to determine whether the areas perfused by an aberrant left hepatic artery can be visualized in real-time using near-infrared fluorescence imaging with indocyanine green. Methods: Patients with gastric adenocarcinoma who underwent minimally invasive radical gastrectomy from May 2018 to August 2019 were enrolled and retrospectively analyzed at a single-center. Patients with an aberrant left hepatic artery and normal preoperative liver function were examined. After the clamping of an aberrant left hepatic artery, indocyanine green was administered via a peripheral intravenous route during surgery. Fluorescence at the liver was visualized under near-infrared fluorescence imaging. Results: In 31 patients with aberrant left hepatic arteries, near-infrared fluorescence imaging was used without adverse events associated with indocyanine green. Six (19%) patients were reported to have an aberrant left hepatic artery upon preoperative CT imaging, while all other instances were detected during surgery. Fluorescence excitation on the liver was, on average, visible after 43 s (range, 25–65). Fluorescence across the entire surface of the liver was noted in 20 (65%) patients in whom the aberrant left hepatic artery could be ligated. Aberrant left hepatic arteries were safely preserved in 10 (32%) patients who showed areas of no or partial fluorescence excitation. Guided by near-infrared fluorescence imaging, ligation of aberrant left hepatic arteries elicited no significant changes in postoperative liver function. Conclusion: Near-infrared fluorescence imaging facilitates the identification of aberrant left hepatic arterial territories, guiding decisions on the preservation or ligation of this arterial variation.

N2  - Objectives: To explore the diagnostic value and the correlation between histological diagnosis and the Ni classification under narrow band imaging (NBI) for vocal fold leukoplakia (VFL) and early glottic cancer. Methods: A total of 91 patients with 119 vocal fold lesions were selected from January 2017 to May 2020. All these patients were subsequently examined by white light imaging (WLI) and NBI endoscopy, and then all lesions were classified by the Ni classification according to the characteristics of intraepithelial papillary capillary loop (IPCL) observed. The gold standard of diagnosis was histopathological results. Eventually, the chi-square and kappa test were applied, respectively, to evaluate the diagnostic value of NBI endoscopy and the consistency of Ni classification and pathological results. Results: The accuracy and sensitivity of NBI endoscopy were significantly higher than that of WLI endoscopy (P < 0.05). For the diagnosis of precancerous lesions under the NBI, the sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value were 69.6% (16/23), 90.6% (87/96), 64.0% (16/25) and 92.6% (87/94), which for malignant lesions were 84.4% (65/77), 92.9% (39/42), 95.6% (65/68) and 76.5% (39/51). Moreover, for patients with low-grade intraepithelial neoplasia (mild and moderate dysplasia), type IV lesions accounted for the most (69.6 vs 30.4%; χ2 = 36.961, P < 0.001). For high-grade intraepithelial neoplasia or carcinoma in situ, type Va lesions were predominant (χ2 = 30.526, P < 0.001), while type Vb and Vc lesions were dominant in invasive carcinoma (χ2 = 64.373, P < 0.001). Besides, the kappa test revealed that there was a high consistency between Ni classification and pathological diagnosis (Kappa = 0.667, P < 0.001). Conclusions: The Ni classification can improve the diagnosis accuracy of vocal fold lesions which enables clear visualization of mucosal microvasculature. This is essential for the early diagnosis of VFL and early glottic cancer during routine endoscopic examination.

N2  - Background: The occurrence of bile duct injury (BDI) during laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) is an important medical issue. Expert surgeons prevent intraoperative BDI by identifying four landmarks. The present study aimed to develop a system that outlines these landmarks on endoscopic images in real time. Methods: An intraoperative landmark indication system was constructed using YOLOv3, which is an algorithm for object detection based on deep learning. The training datasets comprised approximately 2000 endoscopic images of the region of Calot's triangle in the gallbladder neck obtained from 76 videos of LC. The YOLOv3 learning model with the training datasets was applied to 23 videos of LC that were not used in training, to evaluate the estimation accuracy of the system to identify four landmarks: the cystic duct, common bile duct, lower edge of the left medial liver segment, and Rouviere’s sulcus. Additionally, we constructed a prototype and used it in a verification experiment in an operation for a patient with cholelithiasis. Results: The YOLOv3 learning model was quantitatively and subjectively evaluated in this study. The average precision values for each landmark were as follows: common bile duct: 0.320, cystic duct: 0.074, lower edge of the left medial liver segment: 0.314, and Rouviere’s sulcus: 0.101. The two expert surgeons involved in the annotation confirmed consensus regarding valid indications for each landmark in 22 of the 23 LC videos. In the verification experiment, the use of the intraoperative landmark indication system made the surgical team more aware of the landmarks. Conclusions: Intraoperative landmark indication successfully identified four landmarks during LC, which may help to reduce the incidence of BDI, and thus, increase the safety of LC. The novel system proposed in the present study may prevent BDI during LC in clinical practice.

N2  - Background: Although indications of laparoscopic hepatectomy have been expanded, the laparoscopic approach after right hepatic lobectomy has a very high burden. The purpose of this study was to evaluate patients undergoing laparoscopic repeat hepatectomy for recurrent hepatic tumors after open right lobectomy. Patients and Methods: Five cases of laparoscopic repeat hepatectomy for recurrent hepatic tumors after open right lobectomy were included in the study. Results: All the tumors in segment 3 were intraoperatively detected and curatively resected by partial hepatectomy. The tumors in segment 2 could not be detected intraoperatively due to hypertrophic liver deformity and adhesion. They were curatively resected by anatomical subsegmental approach. Conclusion: For recurrent tumors located in segment 2 after right lobectomy, anatomical subsegmental approach should be preferred, not only from an oncological standpoint, but also for securing curative laparoscopic resection and overcoming anatomical difficulties.

N2  - Purpose: To assess the rate of bilateral sentinel lymph node (SLN) detection with indocyanine green (ICG), to evaluate the sensitivity and the negative predictive value of cervical cancer patients undergoing open radical hysterectomy; to compare open versus minimally invasive SLN biopsy performance and to assess factors related to no/unilateral SLN mapping. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed consecutive patients with FIGO 2018 stage IA1 with lymph-vascular space involvement to IIB and IIIC1p cervical carcinoma who underwent SLN mapping with ICG followed by systematic pelvic lymphadenectomy between 05/2017 and 06/2020. Patients were divided according to surgical approach for statistical analysis. Results: Eighty-five patients met inclusion criteria. Twenty-seven (31.8%) underwent open and 58 (68.2%) underwent minimally invasive SLN mapping. No difference in any SLN mapping (laparotomy 92.6% and minimally invasive 91.4%) or in SLN bilateral detection (laparotomy 72.0% and minimally invasive 84.9%) (p = 0.850 and p = 0.222, respectively), in median number of SLNs mapped and retrieved (2 in both groups, p = 0.165) and in site of SLN mapping per hemi-pelvis (right side, p = 0273 and left side, p = 0.618) was evident between open and minimally invasive approach. Per-patient sensitivity of SLN biopsy in laparotomy was 83.3% (95% CI 35.9–99.6%) and the negative predictive value was 95.0% (95% CI 76.0–99.1%). No difference in per-patient sensitivity was noted between two approaches (p = 0.300). None of the analyzed variables was associated with no/unilateral SLN mapping. Conclusion: The use of ICG to detect SLN in cervical cancer treated with open surgery allows a bilateral detection, sensitivity and negative predictive value comparable to minimally invasive surgery with potential advantages of ICG compared to other tracers.

N2  - Patients with pulmonary sequestration are at risk of life-threatening bleeding during lung resection. To perform safe and adequate lung resection in patients with pulmonary sequestration, we utilized the following combination of techniques: (1) three-dimensional computed tomographic (3D-CT) imaging for preoperative planning and intraoperative identification of blood vessels, including aberrant arteries, and (2) intraoperative intravenous administration of indocyanine green (ICG). We describe our surgical technique through three cases who underwent lung resection for pulmonary sequestration using 3D-CT and fluorescence navigation with ICG. Intraoperative identification and division of the aberrant arteries, draining veins, and resection margins of the lungs were successfully completed.

N2  - Background: The aim of this study was to describe the potential advantages of the transoral 3D 4K exoscope-assisted removal of calculus of the Wharton's duct. Methods: A 24-year-old female with swelling in the left oral pelvis was diagnosed of sialolithiasis of distal Wharton's duct. A CT scan confirmed the lithiasic formation and a transoral removal in local anesthesia was planned through the 3D 4K exoscope (VITOM 3D, Karl Storz). Results: A high-quality magnification of the oral pelvis was obtained, with an easy identification of the entrance of the left submandibular gland's duct and the calculus. After blunt dissection the Wharton's duct was incised and the calculus removed. An angiocatheter (20G) was carefully inserted in the duct and removed after 3 days. No postoperative complications occurred. At 7 days post-operative follow-up the patient had developed a neo-ostium 5 mm from the papilla. The exoscope provided a better involvement in the surgery and more interactions of all operating room personnel, residents and students, that had access to the same field of view of the first surgeon with the perception of the depth of the surgical field with 3D technology. Conclusions: The exoscope could represent a valid option for transoral removal of calculi, allowing for precise surgical dissection of the oral floor, thus reducing the risks for iatrogenic lesion of the lingual nerve. It showed also a high potential for training and educational purposes.

N2  - Introduction and importance: Benign emptying of the post-pneumonectomy space (BEPS) is characterized by a decreased air-fluid level after pneumonectomy, albeit without the presence of bronchopleural fistula (BPF). Case presentation: A 66-year-old man with lung cancer diagnosed clinical stage IIIA received right pneumonectomy. The air-fluid level of the right pleural cavity suddenly dropped on the 19th postoperative day. Although we were unable to detect the fistula of the bronchial stump using bronchoscopy, we performed re-operationt. Although a pressure of 30 cmH2O was applied into the airway and air leakage from the bronchial stump was not detected, we covered the bronchial stump with the omentum. Because the air-fluid level of the right pleural cavity decreased 9 days after the 2nd operation without any symptom, we diagnosed the condition as BEPS. Clinical discussion: If a fistula of the bronchial stump cannot be identified using bronchoscopy or thoracoscopy, then determining whether it is BEPS or microscopic BPF can be difficult. Conclusion: It is currently unclear what the optimal strategy is in this case.

N2  - Abstract Objective Microscopic surgery is currently considered the 'gold standard' for middle-ear, mastoid and lateral skull base surgery. The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic has made microscopic surgery more challenging to perform. This work aimed to demonstrate the feasibility of the Vitom 3D system, which integrates a high-definition (4K) view and three-dimensional technology for ear surgery, within the context of the pandemic. Method Combined approach tympanoplasty and ossiculoplasty were performed for cholesteatoma using the Vitom 3D system exclusively. Results Surgery was performed successfully. The patient made a good recovery, with no evidence of residual disease at follow up. The compact system has excellent depth of field, magnification and colour. It enables ergonomic work, improved work flow, and is ideal for teaching and training. Conclusion The Vitom 3D system is considered a revolutionary alternative to microscope-assisted surgery, particularly in light of coronavirus disease 2019. It allows delivery of safe otological surgery, which may aid in continuing elective surgery.

N2  - Background: The aim of the study was to describe our initial experience with the high-definition three-dimensional (3D) exoscope for middle ear surgery versus the operating microscope. Methods: The study included 60 randomly chosen patients diagnosed with otosclerosis (n = 30) or chronic otitis media (n = 30) with a clinical indication for surgery. The primary measurement was the subjective estimation of quality of the visibility of the operating field provided by the 3D exoscope— VITOM-3D (Karl Storz, Tuttlingen, Germany) in comparison to the operating microscope. Results: All procedures, except for two (3.3%) converted to the microscope, were successfully completed using a 3D exoscope. In both stapedotomy and tympanoplasty, the exoscope was superior to the microscope during more superficial portions of the procedures. By contrast, in deeper areas of the middle ear, the exoscope provided significantly worse visibility, but usually not suboptimal. Both intraoperative bleeding and the narrow surgical field substantially reduced the visibility with the 3D exoscope in comparison to the microscope. Conclusions: Overall, our study shows that the 3D exoscope offers excellent, highly magnified, and well-illuminated high-definition images of the surgical field. However, our experience revealed several important limitations of this system, including decreased depth perception in deep areas of the tympanic cavity and reduced visibility in a difficult surgical field, with subsequent need to switch to an operating microscope in select cases.

N2  - Study Objective: Determine near-optimal dose, safety, and efficacy of nerindocianine in pelvic ureter detection with near-infrared fluorescence imaging in women undergoing minimally invasive pelvic surgery with 3 Food and Drug Administration–cleared imaging systems. Design: Open label, phase 1/2a study. Setting: University of Alabama at Birmingham. Patients: Forty-one female subjects undergoing minimally invasive gynecologic surgery. Interventions: Subjects received a single dose of nerindocianine sodium, starting at 0.06-mg/kg body weight and increased/decreased until the near-optimal dose was determined (part A). Examine the degree of concordance between endoscopic and robotic devices (part B). Measurements and Main Results: In part A, composite scores were collected every 10 minutes for 30 minutes and then every 15 minutes through 90 minutes using a scale measuring the anatomy/laterality of ureter visualization. In part B (paired imaging system efficacy), 2 cohorts of 8 subjects each received the near-optimal dose. Composite scores for visualization of the ureter were collected at 10 and 30 minutes postinfusion with the Firefly Imaging System and either the PINPOINT or 1588 AIM endoscope. Composite scores were compared to examine the degree of concordance between devices. Part A comprised 25 total subjects enrolled in dosing groups 1, 2, and 3 (0.06-, 0.12-, and 0.045-mg/kg, respectively). Median time to first ureter visualization was 10 minutes (all groups). The nerindocianine 0.06-mg/kg and 0.12-mg/kg groups had longer length of time of visualization than the 0.045-mg/kg group, resulting in the selection of 0.06 mg/kg as the near-optimal dose. Part B enrolled 16 total subjects in 2 groups dosed at 0.06 mg/kg. Efficacy analysis showed no statistically significant difference in composite scores with Firefly versus PINPOINT or 1588 AIM. Conclusion: Nerindocianine was well tolerated with visualization of the ureter demonstrated in 88.9% of the subjects through 90 minutes postdosing. No meaningful visualization differences were observed among the Food and Drug Administration–cleared surgical imaging systems used.

N2  - Objective: Though the operating microscope (OM) has been the standard optical system in neurosurgery, a new technology called three-dimensional (3D) exoscope has emerged as an alternative. Herein, two types of 3D exoscopes for brain tumor surgery are presented. In addition, the advantages and limitations compared with the OM are discussed. Methods: In the present study, 3D exoscope VOMS-100 or VITOM 3D was used in 11 patients with brain tumor who underwent surgical resection; the Kinevo 900 OM was used only in emergency. After completion of all surgeries, the participants were surveyed with a questionnaire regarding video image quality on the display monitor, handling of equipment, ergonomics, educational usefulness, 3D glasses, and expectation as a substitute for the OM. Results: Among 11 patients, nine patients underwent neurosurgical resection with only 3D exoscope; however, two patients required additional aid with the OM due to difficulty in hemostasis. Regarding video image quality, VITOM 3D was mostly equivalent to the OM, but VOMS-100 was not. However, both 3D exoscopes showed advantages in accessibility of instruments in the surgical field and occupied less space in the operating theater. Differences in ergonomics and educational usefulness between the exoscopes were not reported. Respondents did not experience discomfort in wearing 3D glasses and thought the exoscopes could be currently, and in the future, used as a substitute for the OM. Conclusion: Although many neurosurgeons are not familiar with 3D exoscopes, they have advantages compared with the OM and similar image quality. Exoscopes could be a substitute for OM in the future if some limitations are overcome.

N2  - Background: The DROP-IN gamma probe was introduced to overcome the restricted manoeuvrability of traditional laparoscopic gamma probes. Through enhanced manoeuvrability and surgical autonomy, the DROP-IN promotes the implementation of radioguided surgery in the robotic setting. Objective: To confirm the utility and safety profile of the DROP-IN gamma probe and to perform a comparison with the traditional laparoscopic gamma probe and fluorescence guidance. Design, setting, and participants: Twenty-five prostate cancer patients were scheduled for a robot-assisted sentinel lymph node (SN) procedure, extended pelvic lymph node dissection, and prostatectomy at a single European centre. Surgical procedure: After intraprostatic injection of indocyanine green (ICG)-99mTc-nanocolloid (n = 12) or 99mTc-nanocolloid + ICG (n = 13), SN locations were defined using preoperative imaging. Surgical excision of SNs was performed under image guidance using the DROP-IN gamma probe, the traditional laparoscopic gamma probe, and fluorescence imaging. Measurements: Intraoperative SN detection was assessed for the different modalities and related to anatomical locations. Patient follow-up was included (a median of 18 mo). Results and limitations: Overall, 47 SNs were pursued in vivo by the DROP-IN gamma probe, of which 100% were identified. No adverse events related to its use were observed. In vivo fluorescence imaging identified 91% of these SNs. The laparoscopic gamma probe identified only 76% of these SNs, where the detection inaccuracies appeared to be related to specific anatomical regions. Conclusions: Owing to improved manoeuvrability, the DROP-IN probe yielded improved SN detection rates compared with the traditional gamma probe and fluorescence imaging. These findings underline that the DROP-IN technology provides a valuable tool for radioguided surgery in the robotic setting. Patient summary: Radioguided robot-assisted surgery with the novel DROP-IN gamma probe is feasible and safe. It enables more efficient intraoperative identification of sentinel lymph nodes than can be achieved with a traditional laparoscopic gamma probe. The use of the DROP-IN probe in combination with fluorescence imaging allows for a complementary optical confirmation of node localisations.
U1  - The DROP-IN gamma probe integrates radioguided surgery within the robotic surgical setting. It appears that the DROP-IN gamma probe provides a higher detection rate of sentinel nodes in prostate cancer than the traditional laparoscopic gamma probe or fluorescence imaging.

N2  - Background: Arteriovenous fistula (AVF) is the vascular access of choice for hemodialysis patients. A correct microsurgical vascular anastomoses is essential to the optimal care of patients. Loupes can help surgeons perform such procedures, but often cause neck or back pain and fatigue. Aim: This study aimed to evaluate whether a video telescopic operating microscope (VITOM®; Karl Storz Endoscopy GmbH, Tuttlingen, Germany) could be used as a substitute for loupes to create microsurgical vascular anastomoses. Methods: We evaluated microsurgical anastomoses with VITOM® in 10 patients (6 male, 4 female) from January 2019 to December 2019. The created anastomoses were 7 side-to-side, 2 side-to-end and 1 end-to-end. Results: A valid thrill was always present on palpation. Surgical procedures had an average time of 87.6 min, ranging from 49 to 110 min. Eight patients had AVF maturation; in the remaining 2, one had a thrombosis after 25 days and one couldn’t be dialyzed due to low flow in AVF. Conclusions: The VITOM® system makes it possible to carry out anastomosis in difficult cases. It is both safe and useful for the training of young surgeons.

N2  - Herein, we report a case of a patient with recurrent dysphagia after an open transabdominal hernia repair for a Type IV paraesophageal hernia performed elsewhere. Subsequent work-up and medical records' review revealed the coexistence of a large left epiphrenic diverticulum in combination with achalasia synchronous to the recently repaired paraesophageal hernia. A three-dimensional left thoracoscopic diverticulectomy with a long esophagomyotomy was conducted under endoscopic guidance intraoperatively, with no perioperative complications. At 12 months' follow-up evaluation, the patient presents well with no documented recurrence. Cumulative experience from various medical specialties regarding esophageal motility disorders and endoscopic state-of-the-art techniques, when combined with minimally invasive surgical techniques, provide an effective management of esophageal motility syndromes, overall.

N2  - Objectives: The three-dimensional (3D) exoscope has several advantages over the operative microscope (OM) but has not been extensively reported for its use in malignant temporal bone resections (TBR). We sought to demonstrate the feasibility of performing TBR, both lateral (LTBR) and subtotal (STBR), using the 3D exoscope for head and neck cancers. Design: present study is a retrospective chart review from August 2016 until August 2019. Setting: The study was conducted at a tertiary care center. Participants: Patients were undergoing TBR with the Karl Storz VITOM 3D exoscope. Main Outcome Measures: Demographics, tumor and surgical characteristics, patient outcomes were the primary measurements of this study. Results: Fifty-five patients underwent 3D exoscopic TBR from 2016 through 2019 of which 18% (n = 10) underwent STBR. The 3D exoscope was used uninterruptedly in all procedures with no intraoperative complications. Most tumors were primarily T3 (42%, n = 23) or T4 (55%, n = 30) and of cutaneous (62%, n = 34) and parotid (27%, n = 15) origin. These TBR were often accompanied by infratemporal fossa resections (87%, n = 48), auriculectomies (47%, n = 26), mandibulectomies (53%, n = 29), and parotidectomies (96%, n = 53). On final pathology, 24% (n = 13) had microscopically positive margins. Over the study period, 20% (n = 11) of patients had recurrences with a median recurrence time of 5 months (range: 2-30 months). Conclusion: In the largest case series of LTBR and STBR under exclusive 3D exoscopic visualization to date, we demonstrate the 3D exoscope is a feasible alternative to the operative microscope for LTBR and STBR. While oncologic outcomes remain to be clarified, it carries significant potential for use in complex oncologic procedures.

N2  - Purpose: The utility of indocyanine green dye (ICG) has evolved significantly to the robotic operations including Robotic Assisted Radical Prostatectomy (RARP). The technology can help the identification of sentinel lymphatic drainage in lymphadenectomy for the majority of prostate cancer (PCa) patients. We describe the potential indications of ICG for lymphadenectomy assistant in PCa patients without lymph node or distant metastasis. Materials and Methods: We prospectively analyzed PCa patients without lymph node or distant metastasis with clinical pathological stage T1c to T3a received RARP from November 2019 to May 2020. The clinical data and pathological data, including Gleason score, tumor volume, pathological stage, and surgical findings, were described. All lymph nodes were divided into ICG positive or negative. All patients were divided into low, moderate, and high risk according to the European Association of Urology PCa risk stratification. Results: Cystoscope-guided intraprostatic injection was performed successively in 34 localized PCa patients in this study. The mean age was 66.1 ± 7.8 years old. The patients' number of high, moderate, and low risk was 18, 10, 6. A total of 447 lymph nodes were identified. Two hundred and sixty-two lymph nodes were ICG positive and 181 lymph nodes were ICG negative. ICG positive rate higher in high risk patients 158/259 (61.0%) compare to intermediate/low risk patients 104/188 (55.3%). There was no statistic significant result, but lymph node could be identified in all ICG-positive tissues. There were 12 patients revealed higher Gleason grade group after RARP and two patients revealed lower Gleason grade group after RARP. There were 18 patients showed upgrade stage after RARP and 4 patients showed down stage after RARP. Conclusion: Cystoscope-guided intraprostatic ICG injection with fluorescence lymphangiography can help identify pelvic lymph nodes in RARP for PCa patients without lymph node or distant metastasis.

N2  - Cancer cell metabolism leads to a uniquely acidic microenvironment in solid tumors, but exploiting the labile extracellular pH differences between cancer and normal tissues for clinical use has been challenging. Here we describe the clinical translation of ONM-100, a nanoparticle-based fluorescent imaging agent. This is comprised of an ultra-pH sensitive amphiphilic polymer, conjugated with indocyanine green, which rapidly and irreversibly dissociates to fluoresce in the acidic extracellular tumor microenvironment due to the mechanism of nanoscale macromolecular cooperativity. Primary outcomes were safety, pharmacokinetics and imaging feasilibity of ONM-100. Secondary outcomes were to determine a range of safe doses of ONM-100 for intra-operative imaging using commonly used fluorescence camera systems. In this study (Netherlands National Trial Register #7085), we report that ONM-100 was well tolerated, and four solid tumor types could be visualized both in- and ex vivo in thirty subjects. ONM-100 enables detection of tumor-positive resection margins in 9/9 subjects and four additional otherwise missed occult lesions. Consequently, this pH-activatable optical imaging agent may be clinically beneficial in differentiating previously unexploitable narrow physiologic differences.

N2  - Background: Safety and efficacy of robotic surgery in advanced gastric cancers (AGC) have not been proven by randomized control trials (Ojima et al., 2018) [1], and therefore, standard procedure for AGC is still open surgery. Robotic surgery, however, plays an essential role in ergonomics and offers advantages, such as motion scaling, tremor filtering, seven degrees of wrist-like motion, and three-dimensional vision. Here, we initially report successful robotic gastric cancer surgery on a 49-year-old male with proximal gastric cancer adherent to tail of pancreas and mesentery of the colon. Methods: The patient underwent a diagnostic laparoscopy 10 days before surgery, confirming negative peritoneal dissemination and washing cytology. The patient was placed in a supine position and we inserted five ports. We performed robotic D2 total gastrectomy with en-mass removal of the spleen and body and tail of the pancreas using the da Vinci Xi Surgical System (Intuitive, Sunnyvale, CA) (Japanese Gastric Cancer Association, 2017) [2]. After gastrectomy, to evaluate the blood supply of transverse colon, we employed Indocyanine Green fluorescence using the da Vinci Firefly system and performed a partial resection of the transverse colon and a colostomy. In order to avoid anastomotic leakage of colocolostomy due to pancreatic fistula, we chose to have end colostomy. Roux-en-Y esophago-jejunostomy and jejuno-jejunostomy reconstruction were performed robotically (Ojima et al., 2019) [3]. After the operation, a nasal feeding tube was inserted. Results: The operation took 472 min with no intraoperative complications and blood loss of 105 ml. Final pathological examination showed poorly-differentiated adenocarcinoma (T4BN1M0, TNM stage IIIC). The patient was discharged uneventfully on postoperative day 25. He is receiving adjuvant chemotherapy. At six months, there was no evidence of complications or recurrence. Conclusions: Robotic D2 total gastrectomy with en-mass distal pancreatectomy and splenectomy are feasible and safe in advanced gastric cancer, however, its oncological value has yet to be determined.

N2  - Background: Indocyanine green fluorescence (ICG) angiography has been used for many purposes including as part of a focused parathyroidectomy technique. Concomitant fluorescence of thyroid tissue may cause challenges defining parathyroid tissue during surgery, since ICG is not a selective fluorescent agent. On the other hand, cosmesis is still a big problem for patients due to the visible neck scars produced by the standard surgical technique. In this study, we described a novel technique to solve both these handicaps. Materials and methods: Seven patients who underwent ICG fluorescence angiography-guided transoral endoscopic thyroidectomy and parathyroidectomy vestibular approach between February 2018 and July 2019 were included. Serum parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels were measured intraoperatively and on postoperative day 1. Fluorescent images were confirmed with intraoperative quick-PTH levels. Results: All operations were done successfully without conversion to open surgery. Intense and isolated parathyroid fluorescent images were achieved in all operations. All patients had a 50 % decrease between the baseline and final quick-PTH levels and the final quick-PTH levels were in the normal range in all. One of 7 patients had epistaxis due to nasotracheal intubation. One of 7 patients had seroma on post-operative day 5. None of patients had mental nerve injury, permanent hypocalcemia and temporary or permanent recurrent laryngeal nerve injury. Conclusion: ICG-guided transoral endoscopic thyroid and parathyroid surgery can be used in select patients to increase operative success in focused parathyroidectomy with excellent cosmetic outcome also noted.

N2  - Background/Aim: Precise tumor localization during gastrointestinal surgery improves curability and function preservation. We investigated the efficacy of preoperative endoscopic fluorescent clip marking using a Zeoclip FS with built-in near-infrared fluorescent resins in delineating gastrointestinal cancer for surgery. Patients and Methods: We evaluated the intraoperative visibility of the Zeoclip FS using a VISERA ELITE 2 and the short-term outcomes of 37 cancer patients (colorectal, n=23; gastric, n=14) who underwent preoperative fluorescent clip marking. Results: The study included 23 male and 14 female subjects with a mean age of 73 years (range=39-87 years). Thirty-three patients (89.1%) exhibited clear fluorescent clip marking and easily determined transection lines. Fluorescence was not observed in 1 sigmoid colon cancer patient (2.7%), who required a colonic stent for preoperative obstruction. Three patients (8.1%) required additional procedures for fluorescence visualization. Conclusion: Endoscopic fluorescent clip marking can delineate tumors well for determining the extent of resection.

N2  - OBJECTIVE Since the 1970s, the operating microscope (OM) has been a standard for visualization and illumination of the surgical field in spinal microsurgery. However, due to its limitations (e.g., size, costliness, and the limited movability of the binocular lenses, in addition to discomfort experienced by surgeons due to the posture required), there are efforts to replace the OM with exoscopic video telescopes. The authors evaluated the feasibility of a new 3D exoscope as an alternative to the OM in spine surgeries. METHODS Patients with degenerative pathologies scheduled for single-level lumbar or cervical spinal surgery with use of a high-definition 3D exoscope were enrolled in a prospective cohort study between January 2019 and September 2019. Age-, sex-, body mass index–, and procedure-matched patients surgically treated with the assistance of the OM served as the control group. Operative baseline and postoperative outcome parameters were assessed. Periprocedural handling, visualization, and illumination by the exoscope, as well as surgeons’ comfort level in terms of posture, were scored using a questionnaire. RESULTS A 3D exoscope was used in 40 patients undergoing lumbar posterior decompression (LPD) and 20 patients undergoing anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF); an equal number of controls in whom an OM was used were studied. Compared with controls, there were no significant differences for mean operative time (ACDF: 132 vs 116 minutes; LPD: 112 vs 113 minutes) and blood loss (ACDF: 97 vs 93 ml; LPD: 109 vs 55 ml) as well as postoperative improvement of symptoms (ACDF/Neck Disability Index: p = 0.43; LPD/Oswestry Disability Index: p = 0.76). No intraoperative complications occurred in either group. According to the attending surgeon, the intraoperative handling of instruments was rated to be comparable to that of the OM, while the comfort level of the surgeon’s posture intraoperatively (especially during “undercutting” procedures) was rated as superior. In cases of ACDF procedures and long approaches, depth perception, image quality, and illumination were rated as inferior when compared with the OM. By contrast, for operating room nursing staff participating in 3D exoscope procedures, the visualization of intraoperative process flow and surgical situs was rated to be superior to the OM, especially for ACDF procedures. CONCLUSIONS A 3D exoscope seems to be a safe alternative for common spinal procedures with the unique advantage of excellent comfort for the surgical team, but the drawback is the still slightly inferior visualization/illumination quality compared with the OM.

N2  - Background: Almost a third of the resections in patients with colorectal liver metastases (CRLM) undergoing curative surgery, end up being tumor-margin positive (≤1 mm margin). Near-infrared fluorescent (NIRF) imaging using the fluorescent contrast agent indocyanine green (ICG) has been studied for many different applications. When administered in a relatively low dose (10 mg) 24 hours prior to surgery, ICG accumulated in hepatocytes surrounding the CRLM. This results in the formation of a characteristic fluorescent ‘rim’ surrounding CRLM when located at the periphery of the liver. By resecting the metastasis with the entire surrounding fluorescent rim, in real-time guided by NIRF imaging, the surgeon can effectively acquire margin-negative (>1 mm) resections. This pilot study aims to describe the surgical technique for using near-infrared fluorescence imaging to assess tumor-margins in vivo in patients with CRLM undergoing laparoscopic or robot-assisted resections. Methods: Out of our institutional database we selected 16 CRLM based on margin-status (R0; n=8, R1; n=8), which were resected by a minimally-invasive approach using ICG-fluorescence. NIRF images acquired during surgery, from both the resection specimen and the wound bed, were analysed for fluorescent signal. We hypothesized that a protruding fluorescent rim at the parenchymal side of the resection specimen could indicate a too close proximity to the tumor and could be predictive for a tumor-positive surgical margin. NIRF images were correlated to final histopathological assessment of the resection margin. Results: All lesions with a NIRF positive resection plane in vivo were reported as having a tumor-positive margin. Lesions that showcased no protruding rim in the wound bed in vivo were diagnosed as having a tumor-negative margin in 88% of cases. A 5-step surgical workflow is described to document the NIRF signal was used assess the resection margin in vivo for future clinical studies. Conclusions: The pilot study shows that image-guided surgery using real-time ICG-fluorescence has the potential to aid surgeons in achieving a tumor-negative margin in minimally invasive liver metastasectomies. The national multi-centre MIMIC-Trial will prospectively study the effect of this technique on surgical tumor-margins (Dutch Trial Register number NL7674).

N2  - Objective: Otitis media with anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis (OMAAV) is characterized by adult otitis media refractory to conventional treatments. OMAAV is either an aural manifestation of existing ANCA-associated vasculitis (AAV) or an initial aural manifestation of AAV. OMAAV occasionally causes an irreversible profound sensorineural hearing loss that may require a cochlear implant even in the latter case. In such a case, prompt diagnosis of OMAAV is important but sometimes difficult. When diagnosing OMAAV, repetitive otitis media with effusion (OME) in adults is the most difficult differential diagnosis. Precise evaluation of tympanic membrane (TM) findings would help to achieve a prompt diagnosis. The objective of this study was to discriminate OMAAV from adult OME based on tympanic TM findings. Methods: 10 with OMAAV and 10 with adult OME were included. We established a scoring system of OMAAV tympanic membrane (SCOT) to evaluate TM findings of OMAAV consisted of following three characteristic findings: thickening of pars tensa, vasodilation of pars tensa, and posterior wall swelling. Each TM finding in OMAAV and OME was scored from 0 to 3 by 20 otolaryngologists who never knew the diagnosis. Reliability of the scoring system in terms of consistency between examiners was evaluated by intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC). Validity was tested by comparing the TM scores between OMAAV and OME and by the area under the curve (AUC) of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve to discriminate OMAAV from OME. Correlations between the TM scores and various systemic markers of OMAAV including white blood cell count, C-reactive protein, myeloperoxidase-anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody, and Birmingham Vasculitis Activity Score were examined. Results: The ICC of each score was over 0.95. Each of and the total TM scores were significantly higher in OMAAV than in OME. AUC of ROC curve was 0.9134. The cut-off value set at 2 points had the best combination of sensitivity (93.0%) and specificity (74.0%) to distinguish OMAAV from OME. No significant correlations were found between the total score of SCOT and systemic markers. However, the total score of SCOT significantly correlated with the average hearing level of both air (p = 0.021) and bone conductions (p = 0.032). Conclusion: Reliability and validity of SCOT in discriminating OMAAV from adult OME, the most difficult differential diagnosis, were demonstrated, suggesting that SCOT would be useful to make an early diagnosis of OMAAV. Correlation of SCOT with hearing level suggests that SCOT is also useful to evaluate disease status of OMAAV.

N2  - Objectives: To evaluate the effectiveness of indocyanine green-guided extended pelvic lymph node dissection during robot-assisted radical prostatectomy for intermediate- to high-risk prostate cancer. Materials and methods: After institutional review board approval, between July 2017 and December 2018, we carried out 100 indocyanine green-guided extended pelvic lymph node dissections in patients with localized intermediate- and high-risk prostate cancer, using the Firefly (Novadaq Technologies, Mississauga, ON, Canada) and da Vinci Xi surgical system (Intuitive Surgical, Sunnyvale, CA, USA). Indocyanine green was injected transrectally using ultrasound sonography before each surgery. Then, lymphatic drainage patterns and pathological findings were recorded. Results: Lymphatic drainage routes were successfully determined in 91 right-sided and 90 left-sided cases. Five main lymphatic pathways and sites were identified: (i) an internal route (57%); (ii) a lateral route (50%); (iii) a presacral route (20%); (iv) a paravesical artery site (20%); and (v) a pre-prostatic site (5%). Lymph node metastasis was positive in 15 patients, with 44 pathologically confirmed metastatic lymph nodes. Metastatic fluorescent lymph nodes were found in 15 out of 44 lymph nodes (34.1%). For sentinel lymph node identification, the 34% sensitivity and 64.8% specificity rates were detected in regard to identification of lymph node metastasis. Conclusions: Lymphatic drainage patterns from the prostate can be identified and classified using indocyanine green-guided extended pelvic lymph node dissections. Although the direct role of fluorescent lymph nodes in sentinel lymph node identification appears to be limited, the identification of lymphatic pathways could contribute to high-quality extended pelvic lymph node dissection during robot-assisted radical prostatectomy.

N2  - Background. Over the last few years, advances in technologies and digital imaging have led to the introduction of systems that enable a new approach to microsurgery and supermicrosurgery. The exoscope is a new magnification system that provides a 3D image of the surgical field: microsurgical procedures can be performed with the aid of this instrument. Here, we describe our preliminary experience with a high-definition 3D exoscope (VITOM®, Karl Storz, Tuttlingen, Germany), evaluating the characteristics of the instrument, and also its use as a magnification device for microanastomosis training. Methods. Six microsurgeons with various levels of experience were asked to perform three end-to-end anastomoses and two end-to-side anastomoses on latex vessel models, using, as a magnification system, the VITOM® 3D 4K exoscope. None of the surgeons involved had previous experience with the exoscope, with robotic surgery, with endoscopic surgery, nor with training simulators. Results. The results of the reported evaluation of the tool’s qualities, (VITOM Quality Assessment Tool) included: a good focusing of the surgical field; high image quality; strong luminance; good magnification; clear stereoscopy; and excellent freedom of movement. The exoscope proved to be user-friendly. A constant reduction in the time needed to perform the microsurgical anastomosis at each exercise was recorded. Among other advantages were the easy switching from the magnified image to the macroscopic view, superior ergonomics allowing a relaxed posture while performing the anastomosis, adequate space, and a convenient setting for the assistants to view the operating field. Conclusions. Our study showed that the exoscope VITOM 3D can be successfully used as a magnification tool for microsurgical anastomosis on synthetic vessels, and that it can also be helpful during training courses in microsurgery.

N2  - Background: Near-infrared fluorescence (NIRF) imaging with indocyanine green (ICG) has been recently adopted in pediatric minimally invasive surgery (MIS) in order to improve intra-operative visualization of anatomic structures and facilitate surgery. Objective: This study aimed to report our preliminary experience using ICG technology in pediatric urology using laparoscopy and robotics. Study design: ICG technology was adopted in 57 laparoscopic or robotic urological procedures performed in our unit over a 24-month period: 41 (38 laparoscopic - 3 robotic) left varicocele repairs with intra-operative lymphography and 16 renal procedures (12 laparoscopic - 4 robotic) including 9 partial nephrectomies, 3 nephrectomies and 4 renal cyst deroofings. Results: The ICG solution was injected intravenously in renal procedures or into the testis body in case of varicocele repair. Regarding the timing of the administration, the ICG injection was performed intra-operatively in all cases and allowed the visualization of the anatomic structures in a matter of 30–60 s. The dosage of ICG was 0.3 mg/mL/kg in all indications. All procedures were completed laparoscopically or robotically without conversions. No adverse and allergic reactions to ICG and other complications occurred postoperatively. Discussion: This paper describes for the first time in pediatric urology that ICG-guided NIRF imaging may be helpful in laparoscopic and robotic procedures. In case of varicocele repair, ICG-enhanced fluorescence allowed to perform a lymphatic-sparing procedure and avoid the risk of postoperative hydrocele. In case of partial nephrectomy, ICG-guided NIRF was helpful to visualize the vascularization of the non-functioning moiety, identify the dissection plane between the two moieties (Fig. 1) and check the perfusion of the residual parenchyma after resection of the non-functioning pole. In case of renal cyst deroofing, ICG-guided NIRF aided to identify the avascular cyst dome and to guide its resection. No real benefits of using ICG-enhanced fluorescence were observed during nephrectomy. Conclusion: Our preliminary experience confirmed the safety and efficacy of ICG technology in pediatric urology and highlighted its potential advantages as adjunctive surgical technology in patients undergoing laparoscopic or robotic urological procedures. Use of NIRF was also cost-effective as no added costs were required except for the ICG dye (cost 40 eur per bottle). The most common and useful applications in pediatric urology included varicocele repair, partial nephrectomy ad renal cyst deroofing. The main limitation is the specific equipment needed in laparoscopy, that is not available in all centers whereas the robot is equipped with the Firefly® software for NIRF.

N2  - Background: The introduction of recent innovations in the field of intraoperative imaging and neuronavigation, such as OArm Stealth Station, allows to obtain crucial intraoperative data by performing safer and controlled surgical procedures. As part of the improvement of surgical visual magnification and wide expansion of surgical corridors, the 3D-4K exoscope (EX) represents nowadays an interesting and useful tool. Transoral approach (TOA) represents the historical gold standard direct microsurgical route to ventral craniovertebral junction (CVJ). Methods: We herein report a preliminary experience on 6 cases of 33 patients operated by TOA concerning the simultaneous application of OArm with Stealth Navigation system (Medtronic, Memphis, TN) and imaging system along with the 3D-4K EXs in TOA for the treatment of CVJ pathologies. Results: Neither intraoperative neurophysiological changes nor postoperative infections occurred, but a neurological improvement was evident in all the patients. A complete decompression along with stable instrumentation and fusion of the CVJ was accomplished in all cases at the maximum follow-up (mean: 16.8 months). Conclusions: With EX, the role of surgeon become self-sufficient with a better individual surgical freedom compared to endoscopic surgery and excellent 3D vision and magnification. OArm allows an absolutely reliable intraoperative support for a more effective CVJ decompression. Nevertheless, with OArm-assisted neuronavigation, it can be difficult to navigate C1 lateral masses and C2 isthmi, and to convert 3D into 2D real-time navigation, it can become quite complicate. Finally, the association of EX and OArm appears more time consuming compared to the old fashion one.

N2  - Background: The study evaluates clinical features of vocal fold (VF) leukoplakia in predicting its benign or malignant nature. Materials: 57 patients with 84 lesions were evaluated before undergoing laryngeal microsurgery. The texture, color, thickness and size of the leukoplakia, along with an assessment of the surrounding mucosa vascularization using narrow-band imaging (NBI), and VF vibratory function were analyzed. Receiver-operating characteristic curves were constructed to determine the predictive value of each feature and area under the curve (AUC) was calculated. Results: Histopathological examination revealed high-grade dysplasia or invasive cancer in 13 of VF leukoplakia. Seventy-one lesions were nondysplastic or low-grade dysplasia. Nonhomogenous color, irregular texture, and prominent thickness predicted malignancy with statistical significance (P < 0.05). AUC was 0.793, 0.793, and 0.679, respectively. Absence of a mucosal wave on laryngovideostroboscopy was significant for the detection of malignancy (P < 0.001) with an AUC of 0.927. The NBI diagnosis of horizontal vessel loops was significant with the highest AUC of 0.993. Conclusions: The comprehensive clinical evaluation of VF leukoplakia with laryngovideostroboscopy and NBI creates the opportunity to differentiate between low- and high-risk malignancy lesions. The perpendicular vascular pattern and the limited or absent mucosal wave appear to be the most powerful indicators of malignancy.

N2  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of microvascular anastomosis using a 4K three-dimensional exoscope system (VITOM 3D) in 10 consecutive cases of free flap head and neck reconstructive surgery. This was a clinical human study of free flap microvascular anastomosis using a VITOM 3D exoscope in 10 consecutive patients undergoing reconstruction after ablative surgery for head and neck carcinoma. Microvascular anastomoses were performed successfully using the exoscope in all patients, without any need for the conventional microscope. Arterial anastomoses were all end-to-end. Venous anastomoses were end-to-end in eight cases and end-to-side with the internal jugular vein in two cases. This study demonstrates the technical feasibility of microvascular anastomosis using a 4K three-dimensional exoscope system (VITOM 3D) in a series of 10 cases.

N2  - Background: Gallbladder cancer remains a rare cancer with a poor prognosis. National guidelines recommend radical resection in the absence of metastatic disease. This often requires extensive dissection around the extrahepatic bile ducts. We report our experience of real-time near-infrared fluorescence imaging using indocyanine green during robotic radical resection of gallbladder adenocarcinomas. Methods: Ten patients with gallbladder adenocarcinoma underwent robotic radical resection entailing central hepatectomy (segments IV-B and V) with regional lymphadenectomy. Real-time NIRF imaging was performed using the da Vinci® Firefly system after intravenous administration of ICG 30 to 60 min preoperatively. Primary objective was to determine safety of this technique. Results: Procedure was successfully completed in all patients. Seven patients (70%) had incidentally discovered gallbladder cancer after laparoscopic cholecystectomy and five patients had preoperatively known positive margins. Mean operative time was 173 min. Mean intraoperative blood loss was 88 mL (30–200 mL). Median number of lymph nodes retrieved was 5 (2–8). High ligation of cystic duct was performed close to the common bile duct (CBD) junction with the assist of NIRF and negative margins were achieved in all patients. No major complications (Grade III–IV) or mortality was seen at 30 days post-op. Conclusions: Results from our limited experience demonstrate procedural safety and beneficial use of NIRF using ICG during robotic radical resection of gallbladder adenocarcinomas. It may assist in attainment of negative cystic duct margin and lymphatic clearance around the biliary tree especially in complex re-explorative biliary surgery.

N2  - Purpose: Breast lymphoedema is a largely unrecognised survivorship issue for women following breast cancer treatment. While a few objective methods have previously been applied to assess breast lymphoedema, none are capable of imaging breast lymphatics or identifying lymphatic morphological changes indicative of breast lymphoedema. The purpose of this study was to determine if indocyanine green (ICG) lymphography, a validated assessment technique in breast cancer-related lymphoedema), can visualise breast lymphatics and identify breast lymphoedema. Additionally, ICG lymphography was utilised to investigate lymphatic drainage pathways of the affected breast following breast-conserving therapy. Methods: Twenty female participants (10 breast lymphoedema and 10 healthy controls) were recruited for this pilot study. All underwent a medical history, physical breast assessment, tissue dielectric constant measures of breast water content, and ICG lymphography. Results: ICG lymphography identified lymphatic morphological changes in all breast lymphoedema participants (dermal backflow patterns = 10, collateral lymphatic drainage = 9) and none in the control group. The dominant lymphatic drainage pathway to the ipsilateral axilla was observed in all control participants but in only four breast lymphoedema participants. Collateral drainage pathways in the breast lymphoedema group were to: parasternal (6/10); contralateral axilla (4/10); intercostal (3/10); and clavicular (2/10) regions. Conclusion: These findings suggest ICG lymphography, through the identification of morphological lymphatic changes, is a potential qualitative objective assessment technique for breast lymphoedema. Furthermore, in this group of breast lymphoedema patients it identified changes to the normal drainage pathway of the breast. Understanding these changes will have implications for clinical management.

N2  - Purpose: Intraoperative identification of the cancer location is often difficult to conduct during laparoscopic surgery, especially in early-stage cancers. This study aimed to investigate the feasibility and accuracy of a novel endoscopic clip resin-conjugated fluorescent indocyanine green during laparoscopic surgery for gastrointestinal cancer. Methods: Preoperative placement of endoscopic marking clips equipped with resin-conjugated fluorescent indocyanine green was performed to determine the resection margin in eight patients with gastrointestinal cancer. During laparoscopic surgery, a dedicated laparoscopic system with a xenon light source was used to detect fluorescence. The evaluation determined whether the fluorescent from the clips was visualized during laparoscopic surgery. Results: Fluorescent signal emitted from ICG in the resin of the clips was detected in six patients from the outer layer of the serosal surfaces of the gastrointestinal tract, and the clips aided in accurate resection line of the organ. There were no significant differences of age, gender, and BMI between the patients in whom we could and could not detect ICG fluorescence. Conclusions: The results demonstrated the usefulness of a novel clip-equipped fluorescent resin, which is a promising diagnostic tool to detect accurate tumor location during laparoscopic surgery.

N2  - Objective: The aim of this study was to explore the effects and applications of a robotic minimally invasive bowel-segmental resection, following intracorporeal anastomosis for treatment of deep infiltrating endometriosis (DIE). The procedure reconciled a totally intracorporeal anastomosis (TIA) procedure and robotic natural-orifice specimen extraction (R-NOSE) associated with Firefly™ fluorescence (F) technology (Intuitive Surgical Inc., Sunnyvale, CA) for optimizing outcomes in colon and rectal resection. The authors' initial group experience is also mentioned. Materials and Methods: Fifty-six patients with DIE of the colon and rectum underwent the surgical procedure in a tertiary-care referral institution for endometriosis. A standardized robotic procedure was performed with bowel resection and indocyanine green-induced F used for bowel-perfusion assessment. Specimen withdrawal was performed through natural orifices. Patients underwent the surgical procedures from December 2015 to October 2019. Surgical outcomes data and patient follow-ups are reported. Results: All patients had robotic minimally invasive bowel segmental resection, following intracorporeal anastomosis. The group's mean age was 36.8 (range: 28-46 years); with a mean body mass index of 22.88 kg/m2 (range: 18.9-28.3 kg/m2). In all cases, end-to-end position anastomoses were performed, using a circular stapler; no conversion or diverting stoma were needed. All patients had indocyanine F imaging assessment for bowel and anastomosis perfusion. Mean hospitalization was 4.5 days (range: 3-6 days), and no mortality occurred. No anastomotic leakage or rectovaginal fistula were observed. Conclusions: R-NOSE with TIA including Firefly F is a safe and feasible minimally invasive approach to benign bowel disease, reconciling prevalent procedures for endometriosis and colorectal surgical treatment.

N2  - Background: Indocyanine green (ICG) fluorescence imaging (ICG-FI) has been suggested for intraoperative identification of liver tumors. We aim to compare the intraoperative diagnostic utility of this imaging modality with laparoscopic ultrasound (LUS). Methods: This is an IRB-approved prospective study. ICG was administered intravenously 1–2 days before surgery. The findings on ICG-FI were compared to those on preoperative cross-sectional imaging (POCSI), LUS, diagnostic laparoscopy (DL). Results: A total of 144 lesions (62 superficial [visible on DL] and 82 deep) were detected in the study patients. POCSI identified 74%, LUS identified 92%, and ICG-FI identified 43%. ICG-FI detection rate was higher for superficial (95%) versus deep lesions (4%). 3% (4/144) of all lesions were seen only on ICG-FI. However, all of these lesions were small and superficial lesions that were apparent on DL. Conclusion: Although ICG-FI allowed detection of small superficial lesions that were not identifiable by POCSI or LUS, these lesions were apparent on DL even before ICG-FI. Therefore, its utility as an intraoperative diagnostic modality is limited at the dosage and timing used in the study. We believe that rather than a diagnostic tool, it has more potential for a dynamic use in guiding the resection of superficial lesions and delineating segmental/lobar anatomy.

N2  - Background: Dogmatic denial of vasopressor agents for blood pressure regulation during free-flap surgery is associated with concomitant large-volume intraoperative fluid administration. Yet, the doctrinal banning of vasopressors during microvascular breast reconstruction still is a subject of controversy. Several retrospective observations have recently drawn attention to serious iatrogenic consequences of intravenous crystalloid overload in microsurgery such as thrombus formation and increased flap failure rates. Methods: This prospective randomized controlled trial investigated the potential effects of fluid-restrictive vasopressor-dominated hemodynamic support (FRV) compared with vasopressor-restrictive liberal fluid administration (LFA) on clinically relevant perfusion of the deep inferior epigastric perforator (DIEP) flap via intraoperative indocyanine green (ICG) fluorescence imaging. The primary end point of the study was quantitative assessment of the percentage of insufficiently perfused tissue (NP) on the overall flap. Major complications were assessed as secondary end points. Results: In 44 DIEP flap breast reconstructions after mastectomy, FRV circulatory support resulted in no statistically significant difference in total flap perfusion as detected via ICG fluorescence imaging in direct comparison with a traditional LFA strategy (NPFRV, 31.8% ± 12.2% vs NPLFA, 29.5% ± 13.3%; p = 0.559). One flap failure was registered with LFA, whereas no major complication occurred in the FRV cohort. Conclusions: According to the results of this study, neither a norepinephrine concentration of 0.065 ± 0.020 μg/kg/min (FRV) nor fluid administration of 5.1 ± 2.2 ml/kg/h (LFA) has a clinically significant impact on microperfusion in a standard DIEP flap procedure for breast reconstruction. Consistent with the current literature reporting a rise in complications with intraoperative fluid over-resuscitation, one flap failure occurred in the LFA cohort.

N2  - Introduction: Anastomotic leak is a very serious complication in colorectal surgery. Tissue perfusion of the anastomosis plays an integral role in its multifactorial etiology. Fluorescence angiography using indocyanine green allows visualization of perfusion in real time. Aim: To evaluate the effectiveness of intraoperative fluorescence angiography as a tool to decrease the incidence of anastomotic leak after laparoscopic or robotic low resection of the rectum for cancer. Material and methods: Intraoperative fluorescence angiography was performed sequentially in 50 patients during low rectal resection for cancer with total mesorectal excision, primary anastomosis and protective ileostomy using laparoscopic or robotic technique. The results were compared to a historical control group of 50 patients with the same procedure without the use of fluorescence angiography. Results: The patient sets were comparable in basic demographic and clinical parameters. Intraoperative visualization of perfusion by fluorescence angiography was achieved in all patients without unwanted side-effects. In 6 (12%) patients, the resection line was adjusted based on the fluorescence angiography. The incidence of anastomotic leak was insignificantly lower in the group with fluorescence angiography (18% vs. 10%), which led to significantly shorter hospital stay. Other postoperative complications were comparable between the two groups. Conclusions: Fluorescence angiography using indocyanine green is a safe and effective method with the potential of reducing anastomotic leak during minimally invasive low resection of the rectum for cancer.

N2  - Background: Prepectoral placement of prosthetic devices is rapidly becoming the preferred method of breast reconstruction. Objectives: The objective of this study was to review long-term surgical and aesthetic outcomes following prepectoral prosthetic breast reconstruction. Methods: The study included 90 patients (139 breasts). Follow-up for all patients ranged from at least 1 year up to a maximum of 4.3 years. Parameters analyzed included preoperative and postoperative breast symmetry, rippling, edge visibility, and capsular contracture, as well as secondary procedures such as fat grafting, implant exchange, contralateral procedures, and autologous flap conversion. Results: The incidence of breast symmetry, which was noted preoperatively in 84.4% of patients, gradually declined to 68.9% after 1 to 2 years and to 56.7% after 2 to 5 years. Rippling and edge visibility were noted in 19.4% and 12.9% of patients, respectively. Explantation without replacement of the device was performed in 12 breasts (8.6%). Secondary procedures included autologous fat grafting (23.7%), implant replacement (7.2%), conversion to an autologous flap (12.2%), and a contralateral breast procedure in 15 of 41 patients (36.6%). Capsular contracture (grade 3-4) was demonstrated in 14 of 139 breasts (10.1%). Conclusions: Prepectoral breast reconstruction can provide good to excellent short-term (1-2 years) and longer-term (2-4.3 years) benefits; however, over time, the quality of prepectoral breast reconstruction as well as breast symmetry can change due to various factors.

N2  - Background: HD systems are routinely used in laparoscopic surgery, 4K ultra HD monitors are mainly available within specialized, high-volume laparoscopic centers. The higher resolution of 4K ultra HD video could upgrade the surgical performance improving intraoperative and post-operative outcomes. Methods: We performed a retrospective comparative analysis of intraoperative parameters and post-operative outcomes in a cohort of patients operated on for elective laparoscopic procedures for colo-rectal cancer during two different time frames: 2017 procedures performed using the Visera Elite full HD technology ( Olympus America, Medical) and the 2018 procedures performed the Visera 4K Ultra HD System ( Olympus America, Medical). Results: There was a statistically significant reduction in operative time in patients operated on with the 4K ultra HD technology compared to HD technology (p < 0.05). Intraoperative blood loss was significantly reduced in patients operated in 2018 (p < 0.05). There were no statistically significant differences in complication rate and postoperative outcomes between the two groups.

N2  - Omental wrap is commonly performed after ureterolysis to prevent ureteral obstruction from recurrence of periureteral adhesions and fibrosis. We present the case of a 37-year-old Caucasian woman with a history of two cesarean sections and laparotomy for the treatment of endometriosis. She subsequently developed right flank pain caused by a right distal ureteral stricture requiring a chronic indwelling ureteral stent. Diagnostic laparoscopy revealed extrinsic compression of the ureter for which robot-assisted ureterolysis was performed. Because of inadequate omentum, we report the initial use of a cryopreserved bioregenerative umbilical cord amniotic membrane allograft to perform a ureteral wrap to promote ureteral tissue healing and serve as an adhesion barrier to prevent recurrence of the fibrosis.

N2  - Objectives: In neurosurgery, optimal illumination and surgeon view's magnification are essential to perform delicate and dangerous operations, such as aneurysms clipping and tumors removal. In this paper, the authors report their initial experience using a 3D-exoscope in spinal surgical procedures. Patients and methods: From January to July 2018 we performed 9 lumbar discectomies using a VITOM®-3D exoscope. We decided to examine these cases, with particular attention to the surgical timing and to the postoperative results in terms of pain control (VAS). Patient positioning, surgical instruments and approach technique were essentially the same used routinely in standard spinal disc herniation surgery. A “control” group composed of 9 cases was selected from patients who underwent a standard discectomy during the same period with the same neurosurgeons in order to obtain two homogeneous and comparable populations. Results: The length of operative time was measured and appeared to be longer in exoscope-assisted discectomies than in the traditional procedures (average 160 min vs 133 min); moreover the one-month postoperative VAS of the two groups were collected and compared but, after a statistical analysis, these differences resulted to be not statistically significant. No technical difficulties or surgical complications were noted. Conclusions: Despite the limited group of patients, the VITOM®-3D exoscope can be considered an interesting instrument in spinal procedures. It cannot permanently substitute the operating microscope but it shows interesting characteristics that make it a useful tool for surgeon's comfort and a versatile and relatively economic instrument in the neurosurgical armamentarium, as a part of a 3D working station composed by endoscope and exoscope.

N2  - Introduction: The endoscopic methods are progressing and becoming more common in routine clinical diagnosis in the field of otorhinolaryngology. Relatively large amount of researches have proved high accuracy of narrow band imaging endoscopy in differentiating benign and malignant lesions within vocal folds. However, little is known about learning curve in narrow band imaging evaluation of laryngeal lesions. Objective: The aim of this study was to determine the learning curve for the narrow band imaging evaluation of vocal folds pathologies depending on the duration of the procedure. Methods: Records of 134 narrow band imaging that were analyzed in terms of the duration of the procedure and the accuracy of diagnosis confirmed by histopathological diagnosis were enrolled in the study. The narrow band imaging examinations were performed sequentially by one investigator over a period of 18 months. Results: The average duration of narrow band imaging recordings was 127.82 s. All 134 studies were divided into subsequent series of several elements. An evident decrease in time of investigation was noticed between 13th and 14th series, when the examinations were divided into 5 elements series, which corresponds to the difference between 65th and 70th subsequent narrow band imaging examination. Parallel groups of 67 examinations were created. Group 1 included 1st to 67th subsequent narrow band imaging examination; Group 2 – 68th to 134th narrow band imaging examinations. The non-parametric U Mann–Whitney test confirmed statistically significant difference between the mean duration of narrow band imaging examination in both groups 160.5 s and 95.1 s, respectively (p < 10−7). Sensitivity and specificity of narrow band imaging examination in the first group were respectively: 83.7% and 76.7%. In the second group, these indicators amounted 98.1% and 80% respectively. Conclusions: A minimum of 65th–70th narrow band imaging examinations are required to reach a plateau phase of the learning process in assessment of glottis lesions. Analysis of learning curves is useful for the development of training programs and determination of a mastery level.

N2  - Background: Anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) remains one of the most commonly taught procedures during residency and one of the most frequently performed by neurosurgeons. Neurosurgeons use microscopes to perform surgery and to train other surgeons. Although the microscope provides excellent illumination and magnification, its use will be limited to 2 people: the surgeon and the assistant. Consequently, the scrub nurse and residents watching 2-dimensional images on monitors will have a reduced perception of the surgical field depth and anatomical details. The exoscope has been introduced as an alternative to microscopes and endoscopes. We used a 3-dimensional (3D), high-definition exoscope (3D Vitom [Karl Storz, Tuttlingen, Germany]) in 2 patients undergoing 2-level ACDF for cervical myeloradiculopathy. Methods: The exoscope was used during soft tissue dissection, discectomy, osteophytectomy, and cage insertion. Microsurgical drilling of the posterior osteophytes, which will usually require adequate magnification and proper microscope angulation, was also performed using the exoscope. Results: The exoscope provided a 3D view of the surgical field similar to that provided by a microscope and allowed us to effectively and safely perform the required surgical steps. The main advantage of 3D exoscope-assisted surgery, compared with microscope-assisted surgery, is the possibility to generate videos with a similar view and image quality as perceived by the surgeon. Therefore, the didactic capabilities of exoscopic videos are greater than those provided by microscopic videos. Exoscopes are also smaller compared with microscopes, allowing for comfortable use from the early surgical steps to device implantation. Conclusion: We believe that exoscope-assisted surgery could become a safe and effective alternative to microscope-assisted surgery in ACDF.

N2  - This video shows an exoscope-guided single-stage resection with 3-dimensional technology of a supratentorial cavernoma and a supratentorial hemangioblastoma during the same surgical procedure. The patient is a 42-yr-old man with a history of generalized tonico-clonic seizures. Contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance (MR) revealed the presence of a left frontal cavernoma and a left T1 non-enhancing hypointese temporal lesion (hemangioblastoma). The operation was carried out in the lateral position with the sole use of a 3D-exoscope (VITOM-3D, Karl Storz GmbH&Co, Tuttlingen, Germany). The operating room set-up included the surgeons standing at the head of the patients with the operating and navigator screens in the front of them and the exoscope arm entering from the left side. As recently highlighted, the 3D-exoscope carries several advantages: (1) it allows neurosurgeons to operate in a confortable and stable position; (2) it is less space-occupying in comparison to the microscope; (3) the optics and 3D-screen offer an optimal stereoscopic view in comparison to the 2D-exoscope, important for both surgical and training purposes; (4) although sharing with the endoscope, the image quality and confortable surgeon's position, there is no conflict between the surgical instruments and the scope in the surgical field. The adopted strategy enabled a complete resection of both lesions. The postoperative course was uneventful and the patient was seizure-free; the antiepileptic drugs were discontinued 3 mo after surgery. The 3D-exoscope represents a promising surgical tool, which may become part of the neurosurgical armamentarium. Nevertheless, the conceivable capability to improve neurosurgical results will have to be explored. All procedures performed in studies involving human participants were in accordance with the ethical standards of the institutional and/or national research committee and with the 1964 Helsinki declaration and its later amendments or comparable ethical standards. The patient has consented to the submission of the surgical video for submission to the journal.

N2  - Background: The double-tracer method has been established for sentinel node (SN) mapping in gastric cancer surgery. However, there remain several unresolved issues that prevent its widespread use in clinical practice. In this study, we aimed to demonstrate the feasibility of single-tracer SN mapping in laparoscopic surgery for gastric cancer, using indocyanine green (ICG) fluorescence imaging with a one-step nucleic acid amplification (OSNA) assay intraoperatively. Methods: Patients with clinical T1N0M0 gastric adenocarcinoma preoperatively were considered for inclusion if they had a single primary lesion 4 cm or less in maximal diameter. Immunohistochemical staining with the anti-cytokeratin 19 antibody was performed on preoperative biopsy specimens, and patients with faint positive reactions were excluded. Intraoperatively, single-tracer SN biopsy with ICG fluorescence imaging was performed, followed by laparoscopic gastrectomy with modified D1+ or D2 lymph node dissection. Results: Twenty eligible patients underwent SN biopsy and laparoscopic gastrectomy. SNs were identified in 17 cases (85%), with a median number of three SNs per patient. The median times for SN mapping and OSNA assay were 19 and 35 min, respectively. OSNA assay detected one metastatic lymph node, but all other nodes were negative. No adverse effects were observed in relation to SN mapping. Conclusions: Single-tracer SN mapping by ICG fluorescence imaging with intraoperative diagnosis by OSNA assay is feasible and safe. SNs can be identified in most patients, without producing false-negative results. Further clinical trial to demonstrate the sensitivity is ongoing.

N2  - The surgical treatment of vulvar cancer has undergone many changes over the last century. The morbidity of open inguinal incisions prompts the search for a minimally invasive approach to lymph node dissection. This study reports the outcomes of 4 patients with vulvar cancer undergoing robotic sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping and lymph node (LN) dissection with near-infrared fluorescence. From 2015 to 2017, 3 patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the vulva underwent robot-assisted SLN mapping and inguinal LN dissection. One patient with a vulvar melanoma had robotic bilateral SLN mapping only. The da Vinci Xi System with Firefly technology (Intuitive Surgical, Sunnyvale, CA) and indocyanine green radiotracer was used in all cases. Eight groins underwent robot-assisted SLN mapping, 6 of which underwent inguinal LN dissection. The average operating time was 234 minutes with vulvectomy. The mean blood loss was 124 mL. The operative time decreased, and the lymph node yield increased with each case. There were no wound separations or long-term negative outcomes, such as persistent lymphedema or recurrence. This case series of robot-assisted SLN mapping and inguinal lymph node dissection shows the safety and feasibility of this new technique in vulvar cancer. It may be a valid approach to reduce short- and long-term morbidity.

N2  - Background: Near-infrared fluorescence mapping with indocyanine green dye is a recent advancement in minimally invasive segmental resection. This technique has not yet been reproduced, validated, or objectively evaluated in a large prospective case series. We hypothesized that near-infrared fluorescence mapping is associated with an increased oncological margin distance from the tumor, over and above the best judgment of the surgeon. Methods: This was a phase 2 prospective cohort trial in patients who are undergoing robotic segmentectomy for lung tumors <3 cm. The predicted intersegmental plane was first identified by consensus between 2 thoracic surgeons. The true plane was then mapped by indocyanine green injection. A 7-item binary rating scale was used for the evaluation of feasibility, reproducibility, and added oncological margin distance from the tumor. The margin distance between the tumor and the true plane was compared with the margin distance between the tumor and the predicted plane. Results: Fifty-three patients were enrolled between September 2016 and May 2018 and 31 patients (58.4%) received the planned operation with indocyanine green mapping. In 74.2% of cases (23 out of 31), a score of 7 out of 7 was achieved, indicating the true intersegmental plane identified by indocyanine green mapping was different than the predicted plane identified by the surgeon. In 61.2% (19 out of 31) of those cases, the mean additional margin distance from the tumor to the staple line attributable to the indocyanine green mapping was 2.41 ± 1.6 cm. The overall complication rate was 18.5% (10 out of 53) and there were no deaths. Conclusions: Near-infrared fluorescence mapping in robotic segmentectomy is associated with increased oncological margin length, over and above the best judgment of the surgeon, in the majority cases where it is used.

N2  - Background: Intrinsic near-infrared (NIR) autofluorescence of the parathyroid gland may improve intraoperative gland identification without the need for contrast agent injection. Compared with patients undergoing surgery for thyroid disease, identification of pathologic parathyroid tissue in patients with hyperparathyroidism is essential. This study analyzed the utility of a novel real-time autofluorescence imaging system in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism enrolled in a prospective feasibility clinical trial. Methods: Data on patients undergoing surgery for primary hyperparathyroidism by two experienced endocrine surgeons were prospectively collected. Intraoperative imaging was performed with a handheld NIR device, and images were captured for analysis. The collected data included the surgeon’s confidence in parathyroid identification, both with ambient light and use of NIR imaging, as well as how the imaging affected the surgical procedure. Images were quantified by Image J software, with autofluorescence reported as mean values ± SD. Results: From 2017 to 2018, 59 consecutive patients with a diagnosis of primary hyperparathyroidism underwent resection of 69 parathyroid glands. Use of NIR imaging increased the intraoperative confidence of parathyroid identification (on a scale of 0–5) from an average of 4.1 to an average of 4.4 (+0.3, p = 0.003), all of which were confirmed pathologically. The addition of autofluorescence helped to identify the parathyroid gland in 12 patients (20%), and to rule out other soft tissue as not parathyroid in an additional 9 patients (15%). The mean autofluorescence for the parathyroid in situ (75.9 ± 21.3) was significantly greater than that for the thyroid (61.1 ± 17.4) or soft tissue (53.3 ± 19.2) (p < 0.001 for both). The mean absolute difference in parathyroid versus background thyroid autofluorescence was +15.2 (range, 2.4–53.1). Conclusion: This is the first prospective trial to examine the utility of parathyroid autofluorescence for identifying glands exclusively in patients with parathyroid disease. Intraoperative identification and localization of parathyroid glands by real-time, NIR imaging using their intrinsic autofluorescence is feasible and may provide a useful adjunct during parathyroid surgery.

N2  - Objective The da Vinci Xi surgical system (Intuitive Surgical, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) cannot give tactile feedback to surgeons. This shortcoming may increase the risk of left internal thoracic artery (LITA) injury during its harvest. We utilized Firefly Fluorescence Imaging (Firefly) to assess LITA quality in robot-assisted minimally invasive direct coronary artery bypass (R-MIDCAB). Methods We retrospectively reviewed clinical records and intraoperative videos of 30 consecutive patients who underwent R-MIDCAB with LITA-left anterior descending (LAD) coronary bypass. All patients had post-harvest assessment of LITA blood flow by Firefly with 1 mL (2.5 mg/mL) of indocyanine green injection through a central line. Results Twenty-seven of the patients were male, mean age was 67.7 ± 10.7 years. In post-harvest assessment performed before transection of the distal LITA, blood flow in LITA was well visualized in 28 patients. In the remaining 2 patients, 1 had dissection and the other had severe spasm of the LITA. Firefly was also useful for locating LITA and LAD and for assessing blood flow of the graft after anastomosis. Time required for each Firefly assessment was approximately 20 seconds. There were no side effects or complications due to Firefly intraoperatively and postoperatively. Twenty-six patients had postoperative coronary computed tomography; LITA patency rate was 100% (26/26). Conclusion Firefly is fast, simple, and effective for locating and assessing flow in LITA and LAD before and after anastomosis in R-MIDCAB.

N2  - Extracorporeal video microscopes, or “exoscopes,” provide high-definition views of the operative field and are alternatives to the operating microscope or loupes for large-corridor surgical approaches. In this proof-of-concept study, we aim to determine the feasibility of 3-dimensional exoscopes as alternatives to operating microscopes in otology and neurotology, espeically in conjunction with endoscopes. Eleven consecutive cases were performed using 3-dimensional exoscopes in place of, or as adjuncts to, the operating microscope. The exoscope was the sole visualization tool in 7 cases, with 4 including the use of an endoscope or microscope. There were no perioperative complications. Potential subjective advantages include superior ergonomics, compact size, and an equal visual experience for surgeons and observers. Limitations include low lighting in small surgical corridors and pixilation at high magnification. Exoscopes are potentially viable alternatives to the microscope in otologic and neurotologic surgery.

N2  - Purpose: Radioguided surgery has been widely used for clinical procedures such as sentinel node resections. In the (robot-assisted) laparoscopic setting radioguidance is realized using laparoscopic gamma probes, which have limited maneuverability. To increase the rotational freedom, a tethered DROP-IN gamma probe was designed. Here we present the first in vivo feasibility study of this technology in prostate cancer patients. Methods: Ten patients scheduled for a sentinel node procedure received four injections into the prostate with (indocyanine green-)99mTechnetium-nanocolloid and underwent preoperative imaging (lymphoscintigraphy and SPECT/CT). The DROP-IN probe was inserted via the assistant port, still permitting the insertion and usage of additional laparoscopic tools. Results: The sentinel nodes were resected using the da Vinci® Si robot under guidance of DROP-IN gamma tracing and fluorescence imaging. The surgeon was able to independently maneuver the DROP-IN probe using the ProGrasp® forceps of the da Vinci® robot and distinguish sentinel nodes from background signal (such as the injection site). Conclusions: Overall the DROP-IN design proves to be a valuable tool for robot-assisted radioguided surgery approaches.

N2  - Purpose: To determine the changes in maxillary perfusion during different stages of Le Fort I osteotomies as measured by laser-assisted indocyanine green imaging (LAICGI) and to determine whether various clinical factors affect maxillary vascular perfusion. Materials and Methods: The medical records of those who had undergone Le Fort I osteotomy with LAICGI at the University of Illinois from 2016 to 2017 were reviewed retrospectively. The maxillary perfusion levels using LAICGI were measured before induction, after induction, after down fracture, after segmentalization (for segmental osteotomies), and after wound closure. The effects of clinical variables, including gender, race, American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status, type of Le Fort I osteotomy, intraoperative status of the descending palatine vessels, maxillary movements (anteroposterior, vertical, transverse), and hemodynamic data (mean arterial blood pressure, heart rate), were analyzed. Results: Compared with the preoperative baseline values, the indocyanine green (ICG) levels decreased after down fracture and mobilization, segmentalization, and wound closure; no statistically significant differences were found among these 3 points. Segmentalization did not affect the ICG levels compared with the nonsegmentalized cases. Male gender and the amount of maxillary impaction were significantly associated statistically with decreased ICG levels, although the difference was not clinically significant. Conclusions: Compared with the baseline levels, maxillary perfusion, as measured by LAICGI, decreased from down fracture to wound closure. Segmentalization did not appear to influence maxillary perfusion, although male gender and impaction were associated with decreased perfusion. Because of its safety and convenience, LAICGI shows promise as a method of assessing maxillary perfusion in future largescale prospective studies linking perioperative perfusion to the occurrence of aseptic necrosis.

N2  - Objective: Narrow-band imaging is widely used in the diagnostic work-up of oral lesions. Different oral subsites present three epithelial types (1, 2a and 2b), each with a different structure and function. The aim of this study was to analyse and describe the different vascular patterns seen on narrow-band imaging according to oral epithelial type and histology. Materials and Methods: The narrow-band imaging photographs of healthy, dysplastic and neoplastic oral mucosa were retrospectively reviewed and divided according to epithelial type and histology. The different narrow-band imaging patterns were analysed, related to the clinical appearance of the specific area, accurately described and drawn by a professional designer. Results: The photographs of 302 patients were considered. Six patterns were identified: Normal mucosa exhibited different appearance in each type of epithelium; dysplastic mucosa presented the same pattern in type 1 and 2a epithelia, which differed from that of type 2b epithelium; in cancer, mucosal appearance was identical irrespective of epithelial type, due to complete vascular destruction. Conclusions: The proposed classification could serve as a guide for clinicians approaching narrowband imaging, especially at early stages of the learning curve, to differentiate normal mucosa from malignant lesions and possibly reduce the number of unnecessary biopsies.

N2  - Background. The standard treatment of rectovaginal deep infiltrating endometriosis nodules (RVDIEN) consists in their surgical removal. RVDIEN are anatomically neovascularized. Indocyanine green (ICG) reveals vascularized structures when becoming fluorescent after exposure to near-infrared (NIR) light. This study aims to evaluate if fluorescence-guided surgery can improve the laparoscopic resection of RVDIEN, thus avoiding a rectal perforation. Materials and Methods. Patients with a symptomatic RVDIEN, scheduled for a laparoscopic rectal shaving, were enrolled in the study. Technically, the RVDIEN was targeted and removed with the help of the NIR imager device Image 1 Spies (Karl Storz GmBH & Co KG, Tuttlingen, Germany) or Visera Elite II (Olympus Europe SE & Co KG, Hamburg, Germany), after an intraoperative, intravenous injection of ICG (0.25 mg/kg). Results. Six patients underwent a fluorescence-guided laparoscopic shaving procedure for the treatment of a nonobstructive RVDIEN. Fluorescence of the RVDIEN was observed in all the patients. In one patient, once the main lesion was removed, the posterior vaginal fornix still appeared fluorescent and was removed. No intraoperative rectal perforation occurred. The postoperative hospital stay was 2 days. No postoperative rectovaginal fistula occurred within a median follow-up of 16 months (range = 2-23 months). Conclusion. In this preliminary study, fluorescence-guided laparoscopy appeared to help in separating the RVDIEN from the healthy rectal tissue, without rectal perforation. Moreover, this technique was helpful in deciding if the resection needed to be enlarged to the posterior vaginal fornix.

N2  - Objective: The aim of this study was to compare narrow band imaging (NBI) endoscopy and Storz Professional Image Enhancement System (SPIES) in observing epithelial and/or subepithelial microvascular irregularities and pathologies. Methods: A total of 73 patients with laryngeal or hypopharyngeal lesions were investigated using high-definition NBI endoscopy preoperatively in local anesthesia and using SPIES system intraoperatively in general anesthesia from August 2016 to October 2017. Superficial vascular structures were classified preoperatively (NBI) and intraoperatively (SPIES) according to descriptive guidelines of vascular changes by Arens. All lesions were endoscopically evaluated and divided according to the histological examination into four groups (A—benign lesions, B—recurrent respiratory papillomatosis, C—low-grade dysplasia, D—high-grade dysplasia, carcinoma in situ or invasive squamous cell carcinoma), and results were compared with NBI and SPIES optical biopsy. Results: Benign lesions (polyps, cysts, chronic inflammation, hyperkeratosis) were histologically confirmed in 26/73 (35.6%) cases and identified by NBI in 20/26 lesions (76.9%) and in 20/26 cases (76.9%) by SPIES, respectively. Recurrent respiratory papillomatosis was confirmed in 16/73 (21.9%) and detected in 15/16 cases (93.8%) by NBI and in 16/16 cases (100.0%) by SPIES. Low-grade dysplasia (mild and moderate dysplasia) was histologically detected in 7/73 patients (9.6%) and accurately identified by NBI in 6/7 (85.7%) and by SPIES in 6/7 (85.7%) cases, respectively. Histopathological features of severe dysplasia, carcinoma in situ or invasive squamous cell carcinoma were detected in 24/73 (32.9%) patients. According to the NBI endoscopy the suspected vascular neoangiogenesis was recognized in 19/24 cases (79.2%) and in 18/24 cases (75.0%) using SPIES endoscopy. Sensitivity and specificity of NBI endoscopy and SPIES system in correct prediction of histological diagnosis of already detected lesions were 83.0 and 98.0% and 86.0 and 96.0%, respectively. Results of NBI/SPIES endoscopy and histopathological features of laryngeal and hypopharyngeal lesions were compared and the level of agreement was 81.43%, kappa index κ = 0.7428 (95% CI 0.682–0.832) (p &lt; 0.001) by NBI endoscopy and 81.16%, kappa index κ = 0.7379 (95% CI 0.638–0.880) (p &lt; 0.001) by SPIES endoscopy, respectively. The agreement was confirmed as substantial and strong. Level of agreement of both endoscopic methods was 92.54%, kappa index κ = 0.8965 (95% CI 0.877–0.954) (p &lt; 0.001), agreement was confirmed as almost perfect. Between NBI and SPIES endoscopic imaging methods is no significant differentiation. Conclusion: Both methods, NBI endoscopy and SPIES system, are comparable in detection and analysis of superficial neoangiogenesis, typical for benign lesion and for precancerous or cancerous changes in larynx and hypopharynx.

N2  - Background and Objective: Vascularized omentum lymphatic transplant (VOLT) for treatment of lymphedema has become popular because of no risk of iatrogenic lymphedema and abundant lymphatic tissue. However, perfusion to the omentum can be difficult to assess clinically. The purpose of this study was to clarify the incidence and degree of ischemia in the omentum. Methods: A retrospective study was conducted to review indocyanine green perfusion findings on patients undergoing VOLT. Patients were placed into 4 categories based on the percentage surface area of omentum that was ischemic: normal, less than 25%, between 25% and 50%, and greater than 50% ischemic. Spearman correlation was performed to determine whether an association exists between prior abdominal surgery and the presence of ischemia. Results: Twenty-six patients underwent VOLT for treatment of extremity lymphedema. Twelve (46.2%) patients had normal perfusion, 8 patients (30.8%) had less than 25% ischemia, and 6 patients (23.1%) had 25% to 50% ischemia. Prior abdominal surgery was not significantly associated with the presence of ischemia. Conclusions: Normal flap perfusion is a requisite for successful VOLT harvest. However, over half the patients had some degree of abnormal perfusion irrespective of prior abdominal surgery. Indocyanine green angiography is an important tool in ensuring a healthy lymphatic reconstruction.

N2  - Background Optimal vision and ergonomics are important factors contributing to achievement of good results during neurosurgical interventions. The operating microscope and the endoscope have partially filled the gap between the need for good surgical vision and maintenance of a comfortable posture during surgery. Recently, a new technology called video-assisted telescope operating monitor or exoscope has been used in cranial surgery. The main drawback with previous prototypes was lack of stereopsis. We present the first case report of cranial surgery performed using the VITOM 3D, an exoscope conjugating 4K resolution view and three-dimensional technology, and discuss advantages and disadvantages compared with the operating microscope. Case Description A 50-year-old patient with vertigo and headache linked to a petrous ridge meningioma underwent surgery using the VITOM 3D. Complete removal of the tumor and resolution of symptoms were achieved. The telescope was maintained over the surgical field for the duration of the procedure; a video monitor was placed at 2 m from the surgeons; and a control unit allowed focusing, magnification, and repositioning of the camera. Conclusions VITOM 3D is a video system that has overcome the lack of stereopsis, a major drawback of previous exoscope models. It has many advantages regarding ergonomics, versatility, and depth of field compared with the operating microscope, but the holder arm and the mechanism of repositioning, refocusing, and magnification need to be ameliorated. Surgeons should continue to use the technology they feel confident with, unless a distinct advantage with newer technologies can be demonstrated.

N2  - Background The authors describe the application of a new exoscope that offers 3-dimensional (3D) visualization in cranial and spinal neurosurgery in detail. Methods Five cranial and 11 spinal procedures were performed with a 3D exoscope. Instrument handling, repositioning of the exoscope, handling of the image control unit, the adjustment of magnification and focal length, the depth perception, the image quality, the illumination, and the comfort level of the posture during the procedure were assessed via a questionnaire. Results The following procedures were performed: Microvascular decompression (n = 1), craniotomy and tumor resection (n = 4), anterior cervical discectomy and fusion with cervical plating (n = 2), cervical laminectomy and lateral mass fixation (n = 1), shear cervical lateral mass osteosynthesis (n = 1), lumbar canal decompression (n = 1), transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion (n = 2), thoracic intraspinal extradural tumor resection (n = 1), and lumbar discectomy (n = 3). Instrument handling, the intraoperative repositioning and handling of the VITOM-3D, and the comfort level of the intraoperative posture was rated excellent in 100% of procedures. The image quality was rated equal to the operating microscope in 68.75% of procedures. None of the procedures had to be stopped because of technical problems. No surgical complications were noted that could be related to the use of the exoscope. Conclusions The 3D-exoscopic system is safe and effective tool to perform spinal procedures and less demanding cranial procedures. The image quality and 3D visualization were comparable with the operating microscope. The technique harbors the unique advantage of excellent comfort for the involved surgical team during the procedure.

N2  - Purpose Despite advances in the surgical management of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, the identification of synchronous lesions, precancerous lesions around the main tumor, or the unknown primary in the case of neck metastasis remains a problem, as these lesions may be invisible to the naked eye or with standard white light (WL) endoscopy. However, the advent of tools such as narrow-band imaging (NBI) could help the clinician. The purpose of this study was to assess the impact of NBI during the pre-operative and intra-operative stages of management of oral and oropharyngeal cancers. Materials and methods NBI was used pre-operatively in 47 patients with oral or oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma to identify the involvement of adjacent subsites, multifocality, synchronous lesions or an unknown primary. NBI was used intra-operatively in 30 patients to better define the tumor limits and guide the resection. The advantage of NBI versus WL endoscopy was analyzed by calculating the true and false positive rate pre-operatively, and the need for resection enlargements, histology of the enlargement, and the rate of clear margins at definitive histology, intra-operatively. Results Pre-operatively, the diagnostic gain of NBI was 8.5%, allowing identification of three synchronous tumors and one unknown primary. Intra-operatively, NBI improved the definition of tumor limits in 67.7% of cases, with resection enlargements showing dysplasia and carcinoma in 8 and 12 patients, respectively; we obtained 74.2% negative margins at histology. Conclusions NBI could represent an added value in the pre-operative and intra-operative assessment of oral cavity and oropharyngeal carcinoma.

N2  - Objectives The oral carcinoma is a widespread pathology and still presents poor prognosis. Among the available procedures for its early detection, Narrow Band Imaging technique allows to assess potential vascular network abnormalities. The reliability of this technique in the detection of dysplastic and neoplastic oral lesions was evaluated in a preclinical and clinical study. Materials and methods In the preclinical study, a chemical oral carcinogen was administered to 50 mice to induct both dysplastic and neoplastic oral lesions. In the clinical study 91 patients, bearing suspicious premalignant and malignant oral lesions, have been included. Images of animals’ and patients’ lesions were acquired under white and Narrow Band Imaging light prior to biopsy. Two expert raters examined the images and classified lesions, which were eventually compared to the histological diagnosis. The diagnostic performance included sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio, positive and negative predictive values, accuracy, percentages and degree of agreement between raters’ evaluation and the histological report. Results In the preclinical study sensitivity ranged from 0.57 to 1, specificity from 0.85 to 0.99, positive likelihood ratio from 6.54 to 65.04, positive predictive values from 0.32 to 0.96, negative predictive values from 0.91 to 1 and accuracy from 0.86 to 0.98. In the clinical study sensitivity ranged from 0.63 to 0.99, specificity from 0.89 to 1, positive likelihood ratio from 8.45 to 61.47, positive predictive values from 0.59 to 0.96, negative predictive values from 0.78 to 1 and accuracy from 0.82 to 0.99. Conclusion Narrow Band Imaging is an accurate technique, which holds a great potential for tumour angiogenesis evaluation and for the subsequent early detection of suspicious premalignant and malignant oral lesions.

N2  - Background: Laparoscopic lymph node (LN) dissection along the distal splenic artery (Station No. 11d) and around the splenic hilum (Station No. 10) remains challenging even for skilled surgeons. The major reason for the difficulty is the complex, multifarious anatomy of the splenic vessels. The latest integrated three-dimensional (3D) simulations may facilitate this procedure. Methods: Usefulness of 3D simulation was investigated during 20 laparoscopic total gastrectomies with splenic hilar LN dissection while preserving the spleen and pancreas (LTG + PSP) or with splenectomy (LTG + S). Clinical information acquired by 3D simulation and the consistency of the virtual and real images were evaluated. Furthermore, clinical data of these patients were compared with that of the patients who underwent the same surgery before the introduction of 3D simulation (n = 10), to clarify its efficacy. Results: The vascular architecture and morphologic characteristics were clearly demonstrated in 3D simulation, with sufficient consistency. The median durations of 14 LTG + PSP and 6 LTG + S operations were 318 and 322 min, respectively. The estimated blood losses were 18 and 38 g, respectively. There were no deaths. One postoperative peritoneal abscess (grade II according to Clavien–Dindo) was recorded. A comparison of clinical parameters between surgeries without or with 3D simulation showed no differences in operation time, blood loss, or complication rate; however, the number of retrieved No. 10 LNs has significantly increased in cases with the use of 3D simulation (p = 0.006). Conclusions: This kind of surgery is not easy to perform, but the latest 3D computed tomography simulation technology has made it possible to reduce the degree of difficulty and also to enhance the quality of surgery, potentially leading to widespread use of these techniques.

N2  - Background and Objectives To evaluate feasibility of intraoperative visualization of embryologically defined organ compartments and their drainage by ICG in uterine cancer. Methods Total of 2.5 mg of ICG have been injected into cervix or corpus in uterine cancer patients immediately prior to surgery. Green fluorescence was intermittently detected during robotically assisted laparoscopic surgery (Firefly System®, Intuitve Surgical Inc.). Total of 36 patients with uterine cancer without macroscopically suspicious nodes were evaluated with respect to their compartmental lymphatic network, collecting lymphatic vessels, and the connection to the postponed lymph basins. Results Müllerian (sub) compartment and transport of lymph fluid along the lymphatic collectors and connecting vessels to the postponed lymph basins could be visualized invariably in all patients. Cervix drained along the ligamentous and caudal part of vascular mesometria, whereas midcorporal and fundal drainage occurred along the upper part of vascular mesometria and along the mesonephric pathway along the ovarian vessels. Conclusions Visualization of lymphatic network and downstream flow of lymphatic fluid to the postponed lymph basins by ICG is feasible; it can be used to navigate along compartment boarders for education, intraoperative orientation, and quality control. It seems to confirm the compartmental order of pelvic organ systems and postponed lymph basins.

N2  - Leiomyoma usually originates from the uterus and alimentary tract, but in extremely rare cases leiomyoma can appear in the external auditory canal. Here we present a 37-year-old man with right auricular fullness. Preoperative findings suggested benign tumor or cholesteatoma in the right external auditory canal. We performed total resection using an endoauricular approach with transcanal endoscopic ear surgery. Histopathological and immunohistochemistry examination confirmed the diagnosis of leiomyoma of external auditory canal. Leiomyoma arising from soft tissue, including that in the external auditory canal, is classified into two types: that from the arrectores pilorum muscles and that from the muscle coats of blood vessels. Only four cases of leiomyoma of external auditor canal have been published in the English literature. The other four cases demonstrated vascular leiomyomas. This is the first report of leiomyoma of the EAC arising from arrectores pilorum muscles.

Design: We show a video that demonstrates our technique for accomplishing single-site laparoscopic resection of advanced endometriosis. The video is a step-by-step explanation of robotic single-site resection of endometriosis nodules overlying the ureter and rectum. Background: Laparoscopic surgery has been shown to effectively improve pain and fertility in women with endometriosis [1]. Compared with traditional multiport laparoscopy, single-incision laparoscopy is associated with similar incidence rates of blood loss, conversion to open laparotomy, and wound complications, but it has superior cosmetic outcomes and high patient satisfaction [2-5]. Furthermore, robotic single-incision laparoscopy combined with robotic Firefly technology potentially increases the removal of invisible endometriosis. Without complete resection of endometriosis, patients are less likely to achieve full pain relief postoperatively. Setting: University hospital. Patient: A 36 year old G1P1 female was referred for chronic pelvic pain. She described her pain as hip pain, pain with walking, dyspareunia, dyschezia and right anterior abdominal wall pain. Intervention: To improve detection of endometriosis, we injected the patient with indocyanine green (ICG), a fluorescent dye with widespread medical applications in identifying increased vascularity of tissues. We then visualized the tissues with robotic Firefly technology, a fluorescence-detection tool built into the da Vinci SI Surgical Systems (Intuitive Surgical, Inc, Sunnyvale, CA). Main Results: Because endometriosis lesions are associated with a high degree of neovascularization, the ICG turned the endometriosis tissues dark green, thereby enabling us to detect endometriosis that would not have been seen as readily with conventional single-site laparoscopy. This video demonstrates our technique for successfully accomplishing a single-site laparoscopic resection of advanced endometriosis, including ureterolysis, adhesiolysis, peritoneal stripping, and a rectal nodule excision. Conclusions: We found that Firefly technology and ICG facilitated identification of endometriosis in single-site robotic surgery. We were able to successfully perform single-site laparoscopic resection of advanced endometriosis nodules overlying the ureter and rectum with complete resolution of pelvic pain symptoms and excellent cosmetic results.
