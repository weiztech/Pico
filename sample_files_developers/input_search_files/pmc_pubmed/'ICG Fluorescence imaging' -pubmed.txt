TI  - Assessment of the deep resection margin during oral cancer surgery: A systematic 
      review.

AB  - The main challenge for radical resection in oral cancer surgery is to obtain
      adequate resection margins. Especially the deep margin, which can only be
      estimated based on palpation during surgery, is often reported inadequate. To
      increase the percentage of radical resections, there is a need for a quick, easy,
      minimal invasive method, which assesses the deep resection margin without
      interrupting or prolonging surgery. This systematic review provides an overview
      of technologies that are currently being studied with the aim of fulfilling this 
      demand. A literature search was conducted through the databases Medline, Embase
      and the Cochrane Library. A total of 62 studies were included. The results were
      categorized according to the type of technique: 'Frozen Section Analysis',
      'Fluorescence', 'Optical Imaging', 'Conventional imaging techniques', and
      'Cytological assessment'. This systematic review gives for each technique an
      overview of the reported performance (accuracy, sensitivity, specificity,
      positive predictive value, negative predictive value, or a different outcome
      measure), acquisition time, and sampling depth. At the moment, the most
      prevailing technique remains frozen section analysis. In the search for other
      assessment methods to evaluate the deep resection margin, some technologies are
      very promising for future use when effectiveness has been shown in larger trials,
      e.g., fluorescence (real-time, sampling depth up to 6 mm) or optical techniques
      such as hyperspectral imaging (real-time, sampling depth few mm) for microscopic 
      margin assessment and ultrasound (less than 10 min, sampling depth several cm)
      for assessment on a macroscopic scale.

AB  - At the time of this writing, searching Google Scholar for 'light-sheet
      microscopy' returns almost 8500 results; over three-quarters of which were
      published in the last 5 years alone. Searching for other advanced imaging methods
      in the last 5 years yields similar results: 'super-resolution microscopy' (>16
      000), 'single-molecule imaging' (almost 10 000), SPIM (Single Plane Illumination 
      Microscopy, 5000), and 'lattice light-sheet' (1300). The explosion of new imaging
      methods has also produced a dizzying menagerie of acronyms, with over 100
      different species of 'light-sheet' alone, from SPIM to UM (Ultra microscopy) to
      SiMView (Simultaneous MultiView) to iSPIM (inclined SPIM, not to be confused with
      iSPIM, inverted SPIM). How then is the average biologist, without an advanced
      degree in physics, optics, or computer science supposed to make heads or tails of
      which method is best suited for their needs? Let us also not forget the plight of
      the optical physicist, who at best might need help with obtaining healthy samples
      and keeping them that way, or at worst may not realize the impact their newest
      technique could have for biologists. This review will not attempt to solve all
      these problems, but instead highlight some of the most recent, successful mergers
      between biology and advanced imaging technologies, as well as hopefully provide
      some guidance for anyone interested in journeying into the world of live-cell
      imaging.

TI  - An LED-based multi-actinic illumination system for the high throughput study of
      photosynthetic light responses.
PG  - e5589
LID - 10.7717/peerj.5589 [doi]
AB  - The responses of photosynthetic organisms to light stress are of interest for
      both fundamental and applied research. Functional traits related to the
      photoinhibition, the light-induced loss of photosynthetic efficiency, are
      particularly interesting as this process is a key limiting factor of
      photosynthetic productivity in algae and plants. The quantitative
      characterization of light responses is often time-consuming and calls for
      cost-effective high throughput approaches that enable the fast screening of
      multiple samples. Here we present a novel illumination system based on the
      concept of 'multi-actinic imaging' of in vivo chlorophyll fluorescence. The
      system is based on the combination of an array of individually addressable low
      power RGBW LEDs and custom-designed well plates, allowing for the independent
      illumination of 64 samples through the digital manipulation of both exposure
      duration and light intensity. The illumination system is inexpensive and easily
      fabricated, based on open source electronics, off-the-shelf components, and
      3D-printed parts, and is optimized for imaging of chlorophyll fluorescence. The
      high-throughput potential of the system is illustrated by assessing the
      functional diversity in light responses of marine macroalgal species, through the
      fast and simultaneous determination of kinetic parameters characterizing the
      response to light stress of multiple samples. Although the presented illumination
      system was primarily designed for the measurement of phenotypic traits related to
      photosynthetic activity and photoinhibition, it can be potentially used for a
      number of alternative applications, including the measurement of chloroplast
      phototaxis and action spectra, or as the basis for microphotobioreactors.

PG  - e0190495
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0190495 [doi]
AB  - Synchrotron radiation based nanoscopic X-ray fluorescence (SR nano-XRF) analysis 
      can visualize trace level elemental distribution in a fully quantitative manner
      within single cells. However, in-air XRF analysis requires chemical fixation
      modifying the cell's chemical composition. Here, we describe first nanoscopic XRF
      analysis upon cryogenically frozen (-150 degrees C) fibroblasts at the ID16A-NI
      'Nano-imaging' end-station located at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility
      (ESRF) in Grenoble (France). Fibroblast cells were obtained from skin biopsies
      from control and Friedreich's ataxia (FRDA) patients. FRDA is an autosomal
      recessive disorder with dysregulation of iron metabolism as a key feature. By
      means of the X-ray Fundamental Parameter (FP) method, including absorption
      correction of the ice layer deposited onto the fibroblasts, background-corrected 
      mass fraction elemental maps of P, S, Cl, K, Ca, Fe and Zn of entire cryofrozen
      human fibroblasts were obtained. Despite the presence of diffracting
      microcrystals in the vitreous ice matrix and minor sample radiation damage
      effects, clusters of iron-rich hot-spots with similar mass fractions were found
      in the cytoplasm of both control and FRDA fibroblasts. Interestingly, no
      significant difference in the mean iron concentration was found in the cytoplasm 
      of FRDA fibroblasts, but a significant decrease in zinc concentration. This
      finding might underscore metal dysregulation, beyond iron, in cells derived from 
      FRDA patients. In conclusion, although currently having slightly increased limits
      of detection (LODs) compared to non-cryogenic mode, SR based nanoscopic XRF under
      cryogenic sample conditions largely obliterates the debate on chemical sample
      preservation and provides a unique tool for trace level elemental imaging in
      single cells close to their native state with a superior spatial resolution of 20
      nm.

LID - 20170262 [pii]
LID - 10.1098/rsta.2017.0262 [doi]
AB  - A key feature of optoacoustic imaging is the ability to illuminate tissue at
      multiple wavelengths and therefore record images with a spectral dimension. While
      optoacoustic images at single wavelengths reveal morphological features, in
      analogy to ultrasound imaging or X-ray imaging, spectral imaging concedes sensing
      of intrinsic chromophores and externally administered agents that can reveal
      physiological, cellular and subcellular functions. Nevertheless, identification
      of spectral moieties within images obtained at multiple wavelengths requires
      spectral unmixing techniques, which present a unique mathematical problem given
      the three-dimensional nature of the optoacoustic images. Herein we discuss
      progress with spectral unmixing techniques developed for multispectral
      optoacoustic tomography. We explain how different techniques are required for
      accurate sensing of intrinsic tissue chromophores such as oxygenated and
      deoxygenated haemoglobin versus extrinsically administered photo-absorbing agents
      and nanoparticles. Finally, we review recent developments that allow accurate
      quantification of blood oxygen saturation (sO2) by transforming and solving the
      sO2 estimation problem from the spatial to the spectral domain.This article is
      part of the themed issue 'Challenges for chemistry in molecular imaging'.

TI  - Development of cyanine probes with dinitrobenzene quencher for rapid fluorogenic 
      protein labelling.
LID - 20170018 [pii]
LID - 10.1098/rsta.2017.0018 [doi]
AB  - A multicolour protein labelling technique using a protein tag and fluorogenic
      probes is a powerful approach for spatio-temporal analyses of proteins in living 
      cells. Since cyanine fluorophores have attractive properties for multicolour
      imaging of proteins, there is a huge demand to develop fluorogenic cyanine probes
      for specific protein labelling in living cells. Herein, we develop fluorogenic
      cyanine probes for labelling a protein tag by using a dinitrobenzene fluorescence
      quencher. The probes enhanced fluorescence intensity upon labelling reactions and
      emitted orange or far-red fluorescence. Intramolecular interactions between the
      cyanine fluorophores and the dinitrobenzene quencher led not only to fluorescence
      quenching of the probes in the free state but also to promotion of labelling
      reactions. Furthermore, the probes successfully imaged cell-surface proteins
      without a washing process. These findings offer valuable information on the
      design of fluorogenic cyanine probes and indicate that the probes are useful as
      novel live-cell imaging tools.This article is part of the themed issue
      'Challenges for chemistry in molecular imaging'.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Anastomotic leak (AL) after colorectal surgery is a devastating
      complication; decreased blood perfusion is an important risk factor. Surgeons
      rely on subjective measures to assess bowel perfusion. Fluorescence imaging (FI) 
      with indocyanine green (ICG) provides a real-time objective assessment of
      intestinal perfusion. Areas covered: A PubMed search using the terms
      'fluorescence imaging', 'indocyanine green', 'colon and rectal surgery' was
      undertaken. Sixteen articles between 2010 to present were identified. Main
      outcomes were leak rate reduction, change in surgical plan, and technical
      feasibility. Change in surgical strategy due to FI was recorded in 11 studies.
      Two case control studies showed overall reduction of 4% and 12% in AL rate and
      one showed no change in AL rate between groups. Expert commentary: According to
      the available literature, FI is technically feasible and alters surgical strategy
      in a non-negligible number of patients possibly effecting AL rates.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The success of flap surgery is highly dependant of vascularisation,
      according to the principle of dermal and subdermal perfusion. This principle
      requires compatible dimensions for the survival of the flap. Indocyanine green
      angiography (ICG), a technique enabling an assessment of vascularization by
      fluorescence, has received a considerable impetus during the last two decades.
      The purpose of this article was to conduct a review on this technique and to
      evaluate its relevance in flap surgery. METHOD: We reviewed all articles
      referenced on PubMed from 1995 till 2015 using a search combining the terms
      'indocyanine green', 'flap', 'near-infrared', 'fluorescence', 'imaging' OR
      'angiography'. RESULTS: One hundred fifty five articles were found and among
      those thirty-four were selected. ICG is a reliable technique to locate perforants
      vessels, to determine the outlines of the flat and evaluate its per- and
      postoperative viability and to appraise anastomoses. CONCLUSION: This technique
      allows a reliable and real-time assessment of potential necrotic areas and an
      improvement in the detection of complications compared to conventional
      techniques.
