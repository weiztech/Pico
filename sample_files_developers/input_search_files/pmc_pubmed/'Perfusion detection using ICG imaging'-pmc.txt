TI  - Current Intraoperative Imaging Techniques to Improve Surgical Resection of
      Laryngeal Cancer: A Systematic Review.
LID - 1895
AB  - Simple Summary: Laryngeal cancer is a prevalent head and neck malignancy, with
      poor prognosis and low survival rates for patients with advanced disease. The
      recurrence rate for advanced laryngeal cancer is between 25 and 50%. In order to 
      improve surgical resection of laryngeal cancer and reduce local recurrence rates,
      various intraoperative optical imaging techniques have been investigated. In this
      systematic review we identify these technologies, evaluating the current state
      and future directions of optical imaging for this indication. Evidently, the
      investigated imaging modalities are generally unsuitable for deep margin
      assessment, and, therefore, inadequate to guide resection in advanced laryngeal
      disease. We discuss two optical imaging techniques that can overcome these
      limitations and suggest how they can be used to achieve adequate margins in
      laryngeal cancer at all stages. Abstract: Laryngeal cancer is a prevalent head
      and neck malignancy, with poor prognosis and low survival rates for patients with
      advanced disease. Treatment consists of unimodal therapy through surgery or
      radiotherapy in early staged tumors, while advanced stage tumors are generally
      treated with multimodal chemoradiotherapy or (total) laryngectomy followed by
      radiotherapy. Still, the recurrence rate for advanced laryngeal cancer is between
      25 and 50%. In order to improve surgical resection of laryngeal cancer and reduce
      local recurrence rates, various intraoperative optical imaging techniques have
      been investigated. In this systematic review, we identify these technologies,
      evaluating the current state and future directions of optical imaging for this
      indication. Narrow-band imaging (NBI) and autofluorescence (AF) are established
      tools for early detection of laryngeal cancer. Nonetheless, their intraoperative 
      utility is limited by an intrinsic inability to image beyond the (sub-)mucosa.
      Likewise, contact endoscopy (CE) and optical coherence tomography (OCT) are
      technically cumbersome and only useful for mucosal margin assessment. Research on
      fluorescence imaging (FLI) for this application is sparse, dealing solely with
      nonspecific fluorescent agents. Evidently, the imaging modalities that have been 
      investigated thus far are generally unsuitable for deep margin assessment. We
      discuss two optical imaging techniques that can overcome these limitations and
      suggest how they can be used to achieve adequate margins in laryngeal cancer at
      all stages.

TI  - A thermo-sensitive fluorescent agent based method for excitation light leakage
      rejection for fluorescence molecular tomography.
PG  - 035007
AB  - Fluorescence molecular tomography (FMT) is widely used in preclinical oncology
      research. FMT is the only imaging technique able to provide 3D distribution of
      fluorescent probes within thick highly scattering media. However, its integration
      into clinical medicine has been hampered by its low spatial resolution caused by 
      the undetermined and ill-posed nature of its reconstruction algorithm. Another
      major factor degrading the quality of FMT images is the large backscattered
      excitation light component leaking through the rejection filters and coinciding
      with the weak fluorescent signal arising from a low tissue fluorescence
      concentration. In this paper, we present a new method based on the use of a novel
      thermo-sensitive fluorescence probe. In fact, the excitation light leakage is
      accurately estimated from a set of measurements performed at different
      temperatures and then is corrected for in the tomographic data. The obtained
      results show a considerable improvement in both spatial resolution and
      quantitative accuracy of FMT images due to the proper correction of fluorescent
      signals.

TI  - Novel real-time optical imaging modalities for the detection of neoplastic
      lesions in urology: a systematic review.
PG  - 1349-67
AB  - Background: Current optical diagnostic techniques for malignancies are limited in
      their diagnostic accuracy and lack the ability to further characterise disease,
      leading to the rapidly increasing development of novel imaging methods within
      urology. This systematic review critically appraises the literature for novel
      imagining modalities, in the detection and staging of urological cancer and
      assesses their effectiveness via their utility and accuracy. Methods: A
      systematic literature search utilising MEDLINE, EMBASE and Cochrane Library
      Database was conducted from 1970 to September 2018 by two independent reviewers. 
      Studies were included if they assessed real-time imaging modalities not already
      approved in guidelines, in vivo and in humans. Outcome measures included
      diagnostic accuracy and utility parameters, including feasibility and cost.
      Results: Of 5475 articles identified from screening, a final 46 were included.
      Imaging modalities for bladder cancer included optical coherence tomography
      (OCT), confocal laser endomicroscopy, autofluorescence and spectroscopic
      techniques. OCT was the most widely investigated, with 12 studies demonstrating
      improvements in overall diagnostic accuracy (sensitivity 74.5‚Äì100% and
      specificity 60‚Äì98.5%). Upper urinary tract malignancy diagnosis was assessed
      using photodynamic diagnosis (PDD), narrow band imaging, optical coherence
      tomography and confocal laser endomicroscopy. Only PDD demonstrated consistent
      improvements in overall diagnostic accuracy in five trials (sensitivity 94‚Äì96%
      and specificity 96.6‚Äì100%). Limited evidence for optical coherence tomography in 
      percutaneous renal biopsy was identified, with anecdotal evidence for any
      modality in penile cancer. Conclusions: Evidence supporting the efficacy for
      identified novel imaging modalities remains limited at present. However, OCT for 
      bladder cancer and PDD in upper tract malignancy demonstrate the best potential
      for improvement in overall diagnostic accuracy. OCT may additionally aid
      intraoperative decision making via real-time staging of disease. Both modalities 
      require ongoing investigation through larger, well-conducted clinical trials to
      assess their diagnostic accuracy, use as an intraoperative staging aid and how to
      best utilise them within clinical practice.

TI  - Optically and acoustically triggerable sub-micron phase-change contrast agents
      for enhanced photoacoustic and ultrasound imaging.
PG  - 26-36
AB  - We demonstrate a versatile phase-change sub-micron contrast agent providing three
      modes of contrast enhancement: 1) photoacoustic imaging contrast, 2) ultrasound
      contrast with optical activation, and 3) ultrasound contrast with acoustic
      activation. This agent, which we name ‚ÄòCy-droplet‚Äô, has the following novel
      features. It comprises a highly volatile perfluorocarbon for easy versatile
      activation, and a near-infrared optically absorbing dye chosen to absorb light at
      a wavelength with good tissue penetration. It is manufactured via a ‚Äòmicrobubble 
      condensation‚Äô method. The phase-transition of Cy-droplets can be optically
      triggered by pulsed-laser illumination, inducing photoacoustic signal and forming
      stable gas bubbles that are visible with echo-ultrasound in situ. Alternatively, 
      Cy-droplets can be converted to microbubble contrast agents upon acoustic
      activation with clinical ultrasound. Potentially all modes offer extravascular
      contrast enhancement because of the sub-micron initial size. Such versatility of 
      acoustic and optical ‚Äòtriggerability‚Äô can potentially improve multi-modality
      imaging, molecularly targeted imaging and controlled drug release.
