TI  - Does 3D-assisted surgery of tibial plateau fractures improve surgical and patient
      outcome? A systematic review of 1074 patients.
LID - 10.1007/s00068-021-01773-2 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The aim of this systematic review was to provide an overview of current 
      applications of 3D technologies in surgical management of tibial plateau
      fractures and to assess whether 3D-assisted surgery results in improved clinical 
      outcome as compared to surgery based on conventional imaging modalities. METHODS:
      A literature search was performed in Pubmed and Embase for articles reporting on 
      the use of 3D techniques in operative management of tibial plateau fractures.
      This systematic review was performed in concordance with the PRISMA-guidelines.
      Methodological quality and risk of bias was assessed according to the guidelines 
      of the McMaster Critical Appraisal. Differences in terms of operation time, blood
      loss, fluoroscopy frequency, intra-operative revision rates and patient-reported 
      outcomes between 3D-assisted and conventional surgery were assessed. Data were
      pooled using the inverse variance weighting method in RevMan. RESULTS: Twenty
      articles evaluating 948 patients treated with 3D-assisted surgery and 126
      patients with conventional surgery were included. Five different concepts of
      3D-assisted surgery were identified: '3D virtual visualization', '3D printed
      hand-held fracture models', 'Pre-contouring of osteosynthesis plates', '3D
      printed surgical guides', and 'Intra-operative 3D imaging'. 3D-assisted surgery
      resulted in reduced operation time (104.7 vs. 126.4 min; P < 0.01), less blood
      loss (241 ml vs. 306 ml; P < 0.01), decreased frequency of fluoroscopy (5.8 vs.
      9.1 times; P < 0.01). No differences in functional outcome was found (Hospital
      for Special Surgery Knee-Rating Scale: 88.6 vs. 82.8; P = 0.23). CONCLUSIONS:
      Five concepts of 3D-assisted surgical management of tibial plateau fractures
      emerged over the last decade. These include 3D virtual fracture visualization,
      3D-printed hand-held fracture models for surgical planning, 3D-printed models for
      pre-contouring of osteosynthesis plates, 3D-printed surgical guides, and
      intra-operative 3D imaging. 3D-assisted surgery may have a positive effect on
      operation time, blood loss, and fluoroscopy frequency.

TI  - Updated Trends in Imaging Practices for Pancreatic Neuroendocrine Tumors (PNETs):
      A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis to Pave the Way for Standardization in the 
      New Era of Big Data and Artificial Intelligence.
PG  - 628408
LID - 10.3389/fonc.2021.628408 [doi]
AB  - Purpose: Medical imaging plays a central and decisive role in guiding the
      management of patients with pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (PNETs). Our aim was
      to synthesize all recent literature of PNETs, enabling a comparison of all
      imaging practices. Methods: based on a systematic review and meta-analysis
      approach, we collected; using MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library databases;
      all recent imaging-based studies, published from December 2014 to December 2019. 
      Study quality assessment was performed by QUADAS-2 and MINORS tools. Results: 161
      studies consisting of 19852 patients were included. There were 63 'imaging'
      studies evaluating the accuracy of medical imaging, and 98 'clinical' studies
      using medical imaging as a tool for response assessment. A wide heterogeneity of 
      practices was demonstrated: imaging modalities were: CT (57.1%, n=92), MR (42.9%,
      n=69), PET/CT (13.3%, n=31), and SPECT/CT (9.3%, n=15). International imaging
      guidelines were mentioned in 2.5% (n=4/161) of studies. In clinical studies,
      imaging protocol was not mentioned in 30.6% (n=30/98) of cases and only mentioned
      imaging modality without further information in 63.3% (n=62/98), as compared to
      imaging studies (1.6% (n=1/63) of (p<0.001)). QUADAS-2 and MINORS tools
      deciphered existing biases in the current literature. Conclusion: We provide an
      overview of the updated current trends in use of medical imaging for diagnosis
      and response assessment in PNETs. The most commonly used imaging modalities are
      anatomical (CT and MRI), followed by PET/CT and SPECT/CT. Therefore,
      standardization and homogenization of PNETs imaging practices is needed to
      aggregate data and leverage a big data approach for Artificial Intelligence
      purposes.

TI  - A bioimpedance-based monitor for real-time detection and identification of
      secondary brain injury.
PG  - 15454
LID - 10.1038/s41598-021-94600-y [doi]
AB  - Secondary brain injury impacts patient prognosis and can lead to long-term
      morbidity and mortality in cases of trauma. Continuous monitoring of secondary
      injury in acute clinical settings is primarily limited to intracranial pressure
      (ICP); however, ICP is unable to identify essential underlying etiologies of
      injury needed to guide treatment (e.g. immediate surgical intervention vs medical
      management). Here we show that a novel intracranial bioimpedance monitor (BIM)
      can detect onset of secondary injury, differentiate focal (e.g. hemorrhage) from 
      global (e.g. edema) events, identify underlying etiology and provide localization
      of an intracranial mass effect. We found in an in vivo porcine model that the BIM
      detected changes in intracranial volume down to 0.38 mL, differentiated high
      impedance (e.g. ischemic) from low impedance (e.g. hemorrhagic) injuries (p <
      0.001), separated focal from global events (p < 0.001) and provided coarse
      'imaging' through localization of the mass effect. This work presents for the
      first time the full design, development, characterization and successful
      implementation of an intracranial bioimpedance monitor. This BIM technology could
      be further translated to clinical pathologies including but not limited to
      traumatic brain injury, intracerebral hemorrhage, stroke, hydrocephalus and
      post-surgical monitoring.

TI  - Assessment of the deep resection margin during oral cancer surgery: A systematic 
      review.

AB  - The main challenge for radical resection in oral cancer surgery is to obtain
      adequate resection margins. Especially the deep margin, which can only be
      estimated based on palpation during surgery, is often reported inadequate. To
      increase the percentage of radical resections, there is a need for a quick, easy,
      minimal invasive method, which assesses the deep resection margin without
      interrupting or prolonging surgery. This systematic review provides an overview
      of technologies that are currently being studied with the aim of fulfilling this 
      demand. A literature search was conducted through the databases Medline, Embase
      and the Cochrane Library. A total of 62 studies were included. The results were
      categorized according to the type of technique: 'Frozen Section Analysis',
      'Fluorescence', 'Optical Imaging', 'Conventional imaging techniques', and
      'Cytological assessment'. This systematic review gives for each technique an
      overview of the reported performance (accuracy, sensitivity, specificity,
      positive predictive value, negative predictive value, or a different outcome
      measure), acquisition time, and sampling depth. At the moment, the most
      prevailing technique remains frozen section analysis. In the search for other
      assessment methods to evaluate the deep resection margin, some technologies are
      very promising for future use when effectiveness has been shown in larger trials,
      e.g., fluorescence (real-time, sampling depth up to 6 mm) or optical techniques
      such as hyperspectral imaging (real-time, sampling depth few mm) for microscopic 
      margin assessment and ultrasound (less than 10 min, sampling depth several cm)
      for assessment on a macroscopic scale.

TI  - Fractional Calculus Models of Magnetic Resonance Phenomena: Relaxation and
      Diffusion.
PG  - 285-326
LID - 10.1615/CritRevBiomedEng.2020033925 [doi]
AB  - Applications of fractional calculus in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have
      increased over the last twenty years. From the mathematical, computational, and
      biophysical perspectives, fractional calculus provides new tools for describing
      the complexity of biological tissues (cells, organelles, membranes and
      macromolecules). Specifically, fractional order models capture molecular dynamics
      (transport, rotation, and vibration) by incorporating power law convolution
      kernels into the time and space derivatives appearing in the equations that
      govern nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) phenomena. Hence, it is natural to expect
      fractional calculus models of relaxation and diffusion to be applied to problems 
      in NMR and MRI. Early studies considered the fractal dimensions of multi-scale
      materials in the non-linear growth of the mean squared displacement, assumed
      power-law decays of the spectral density, and suggested stretched exponential
      signal relaxation to describe non-Gaussian behavior. Subsequently, fractional
      order generalization of the Bloch, and Bloch-Torrey equations were developed to
      characterize NMR (and MRI) relaxation and diffusion. However, even for simple
      geometries, analytical solutions of fractional order equations in time and space 
      are difficult to obtain, and predictions of the corresponding changes in image
      contrast are not always possible. Currently, a multifaceted approach using coarse
      graining, simulation, and accelerated computation is being developed to identify 
      'imaging' biomarkers of disease. This review surveys the principal fractional
      order models used to describe NMR and MRI phenomena, identifies connections and
      limitations, and finally points to future applications of the approach.

      Tumour Management: Defining the Evidence Gap and Opportunities for Future
      Research.
PG  - 620070
LID - 10.3389/fonc.2021.620070 [doi]
AB  - Objectiv e: To summarise current evidence for the utility of interval imaging in 
      monitoring disease in adult brain tumours, and to develop a position for future
      evidence gathering while incorporating the application of data science and health
      economics. Methods: Experts in 'interval imaging' (imaging at pre-planned
      time-points to assess tumour status); data science; health economics, trial
      management of adult brain tumours, and patient representatives convened in
      London, UK. The current evidence on the use of interval imaging for monitoring
      brain tumours was reviewed. To improve the evidence that interval imaging has a
      role in disease management, we discussed specific themes of data science, health 
      economics, statistical considerations, patient and carer perspectives, and
      multi-centre study design. Suggestions for future studies aimed at filling
      knowledge gaps were discussed. Results: Meningioma and glioma were identified as 
      priorities for interval imaging utility analysis. The "monitoring biomarkers"
      most commonly used in adult brain tumour patients were standard structural MRI
      features. Interval imaging was commonly scheduled to provide reported imaging
      prior to planned, regular clinic visits. There is limited evidence relating
      interval imaging in the absence of clinical deterioration to management change
      that alters morbidity, mortality, quality of life, or resource use.
      Progression-free survival is confounded as an outcome measure when using
      structural MRI in glioma. Uncertainty from imaging causes distress for some
      patients and their caregivers, while for others it provides an important
      indicator of disease activity. Any study design that changes imaging regimens
      should consider the potential for influencing current or planned therapeutic
      trials, ensure that opportunity costs are measured, and capture indirect benefits
      and added value. Conclusion: Evidence for the value, and therefore utility, of
      regular interval imaging is currently lacking. Ongoing collaborative efforts will
      improve trial design and generate the evidence to optimise monitoring imaging
      biomarkers in standard of care brain tumour management.

TI  - The Leiden Convention coronary coding system: translation from the surgical to
      the universal view.
LID - jeab012 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/ehjci/jeab012 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: The Leiden Convention coronary coding system structures the large variety
      of coronary anatomical patterns; isolated and in congenital heart disease. It is 
      widely used by surgeons but not by cardiologists as the system uses a surgeons'
      cranial view. Since thoracic surgeons and cardiologists work closely together, a 
      coronary coding system practical for both disciplines is mandatory. To this
      purpose, the 'surgical' coronary coding system was adapted to an 'imaging'
      system, extending its applicability to different cardiac imaging techniques.
      METHODS AND RESULTS: The physician takes place in the non-facing sinus of the
      aortic valve, oriented with the back towards the pulmonary valve, looking outward
      from the sinus. From this position, the right-hand sinus is sinus 1, and the
      left-hand sinus is sinus 2. Next, a clockwise rotation is adopted starting at
      sinus 1 and the encountered coronary branches described. Annotation of the normal
      anatomical pattern is 1R-2LCx, corresponding to the 'surgical' coding system. The
      'imaging' coding system was made applicable for Computed Tomography (CT),
      Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), echocardiography, and coronary angiography,
      thus facilitating interdisciplinary use. To assess applicability in daily
      clinical practice, images from different imaging modalities were annotated by
      cardiologists and cardiology residents and results scored. The average score upon
      evaluation was 87.5%, with the highest scores for CT and MRI images (average
      90%). CONCLUSION: The imaging Leiden Convention is a coronary coding system that 
      unifies the annotation of coronary anatomy for thoracic surgeons, cardiologists, 
      and radiologists. Validation of the coding system shows it can be easily and
      reliably applied in clinical practice.

AB  - Percutaneous therapeutic options for an increasing variety of structural heart
      diseases (SHD) have grown dramatically. Within this context of continuous
      expansion of devices and procedures, there has been increased demand for
      physicians with specific knowledge, skills, and advanced training in
      multimodality cardiac imaging. As a consequence, a new subspecialty of
      'Interventional Imaging' for SHD interventions and a new dedicated professional
      figure, the 'Interventional Imager' with specific competencies has emerged. The
      interventional imager is an integral part of the heart team and plays a central
      role in decision-making throughout the patient pathway, including the
      appropriateness and feasibility of a procedure, pre-procedural planning,
      intra-procedural guidance, and post-procedural follow-up. However, inherent
      challenges exist to develop a training programme for SHD imaging that differs
      from traditional cardiovascular imaging pathways. The purpose of this document is
      to provide the standard requirements for the training in SHD imaging, as well as 
      a starting point for an official certification process for SHD interventional
      imager.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: PSMA-targeted PET/CT is a 'Next Generation Imaging' technique with 
      superior sensitivity and specificity for detecting recurrent prostate cancer
      compared with conventional imaging, allowing more accurate staging and
      re-staging. AREAS COVERED: This article reviews the role of PSMA-targeted PET/CT 
      in clinical management of men with recurrent prostate cancer. EXPERT OPINION:
      Through enhanced spatial characterization of recurrent prostate cancer,
      PSMA-targeted PET/CT has shown significant impact on management decisions. In
      particular, by identifying men with recurrence confined to the prostate or pelvic
      nodes, PSMA-targeted PET/CT enables selective deployment of localized salvage
      therapies for management of biochemical failure after primary treatment with
      prostatectomy or radiotherapy. In oligometastatic disease, PSMA-targeted PET/CT
      may improve patient selection and treatment accuracy for metastasis-directed
      therapy and early phase II studies show encouraging results in delaying the need 
      for systemic therapy. Further, quantitative PSMA-targeted PET/CT for monitoring
      response and therapeutic PSMA-targeted radiopharmaceuticals are emerging as
      encouraging treatment options in the setting of castrate-resistant disease.

TI  - Identifying goals, roles and tasks of extended scope physiotherapy in Dutch
      primary care- an exploratory, qualitative multi-step study.
PG  - 19
LID - 10.1186/s12913-020-05986-w [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Rising healthcare costs, an increasing general practitioner shortage 
      and an aging population have made healthcare organization transformation a
      priority. To meet these challenges, traditional roles of non-medical members have
      been reconsidered. Within the domain of physiotherapy, there has been significant
      interest in Extended Scope Physiotherapy (ESP). Although studies have focused on 
      the perceptions of different stakeholders in relation to ESP, there is a large
      variety in the interpretation of ESP. AIM: To identify a paradigm of ESP
      incorporating goals, roles and tasks, to provide a consistent approach for the
      implementation of ESP in primary care. METHODS: An exploratory, qualitative
      multi-step design was used containing a scoping review, focus groups and
      semi-structured interviews. The study population consisted of patients,
      physiotherapists, general practitioners and indirect stakeholders such as
      lecturers, health insurers and policymakers related to primary care
      physiotherapy. The main topics discussed in the focus groups and semi-structured 
      interviews were the goals, skills and roles affiliated with ESP. The 'framework' 
      method, developed by Ritchie & Spencer, was used as analytical approach to refine
      the framework. RESULTS: Two focus groups and twelve semi-structured interviews
      were conducted to explore stakeholder perspectives on ESP in Dutch primary care. 
      A total of 11 physiotherapists, six general practitioners, five patients and four
      indirect stakeholders participated in the study. There was a lot of support for
      'decreasing healthcare costs', 'tackling increased health demand' and 'improving 
      healthcare effectiveness' as main goals of ESP. The most agreement was reached on
      'triaging', 'referring to specialists' and 'ordering diagnostic imaging' as tasks
      fitting for ESP. Most stakeholders also supported 'working in a multidisciplinary
      team', 'working as a consultant' and 'an ESP role separated from a
      physiotherapist role' as roles of ESP. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the scoping review, 
      focus groups and interviews with direct and indirect stakeholders, it appears
      that there is sufficient support for ESP in the Netherlands. This study provides 
      a clear presentation of how ESP can be conceptualized in primary care. A pilot
      focused on determining the feasibility of ESP in Dutch primary care will be the
      next step.

TI  - Training, competence, and quality improvement in echocardiography: the European
      Association of Cardiovascular Imaging Recommendations: update 2020.
PG  - 1305-1319
LID - 10.1093/ehjci/jeaa266 [doi]
AB  - The primary mission of the European Association of Cardiovascular Imaging (EACVI)
      is 'to promote excellence in clinical diagnosis, research, technical development,
      and education in cardiovascular imaging'. Echocardiography is a key component in 
      the evaluation of patients with known or suspected cardiovascular disease and is 
      essential for the high quality and effective practice of clinical cardiology. The
      EACVI aims to update the previously published recommendations for training,
      competence, and quality improvement in echocardiography since these activities
      are increasingly recognized by patients, physicians, and payers. The purpose of
      this document is to provide the general requirements for training and competence 
      in echocardiography, to outline the principles of quality evaluation, and to
      recommend a set of measures for improvement, with the ultimate goal of raising
      the standards of echocardiographic practice. Moreover, the document aims to
      provide specific guidance for advanced echo techniques, which have dramatically
      evolved since the previous publication in 2009.

TI  - Computer vision in autism spectrum disorder research: a systematic review of
      published studies from 2009 to 2019.
PG  - 333

AB  - The current state of computer vision methods applied to autism spectrum disorder 
      (ASD) research has not been well established. Increasing evidence suggests that
      computer vision techniques have a strong impact on autism research. The primary
      objective of this systematic review is to examine how computer vision analysis
      has been useful in ASD diagnosis, therapy and autism research in general. A
      systematic review of publications indexed on PubMed, IEEE Xplore and ACM Digital 
      Library was conducted from 2009 to 2019. Search terms included ['autis*' AND
      ('computer vision' OR 'behavio* imaging' OR 'behavio* analysis' OR 'affective
      computing')]. Results are reported according to PRISMA statement. A total of 94
      studies are included in the analysis. Eligible papers are categorised based on
      the potential biological/behavioural markers quantified in each study. Then,
      different computer vision approaches that were employed in the included papers
      are described. Different publicly available datasets are also reviewed in order
      to rapidly familiarise researchers with datasets applicable to their field and to
      accelerate both new behavioural and technological work on autism research.
      Finally, future research directions are outlined. The findings in this review
      suggest that computer vision analysis is useful for the quantification of
      behavioural/biological markers which can further lead to a more objective
      analysis in autism research.

TI  - Mass Spectrometry Imaging as a Potential Tool to Investigate Human Osteoarthritis
      at the Tissue Level.
LID - E6414 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijms21176414 [doi]
AB  - Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common degenerative joint disease, predicted to
      increase in incidence year by year due to an ageing population. Due to the
      biological complexity of the disease, OA remains highly heterogeneous. Although
      much work has been undertaken in the past few years, underlying molecular
      mechanisms leading to joint tissue structural deterioration are not fully
      understood, with only few validated markers for disease diagnosis and progression
      being available. Discovery and quantitation of various OA-specific biomarkers is 
      still largely focused on the bodily fluids which does not appear to be reliable
      and sensitive enough. However, with the advancement of spatial proteomic
      techniques, several novel peptides and proteins, as well as N-glycans, can be
      identified and localised in a reliable and sensitive manner. To summarise the
      important findings from OA biomarker studies, papers published between 2000 and
      2020 were searched via Google Scholar and PubMed. Medical subject heading (MeSH) 
      terms 'osteoarthritis', 'biomarker', 'synovial fluid', 'serum', 'urine',
      'matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionisation', 'mass spectrometry imaging',
      'proteomic', 'glycomic', 'cartilage', 'synovium' AND 'subchondral bone' were
      selectively used. The literature search was restricted to full-text original
      research articles and written only in English. Two main areas were reviewed for
      OA biomarker studies: (1) an overview of disease-specific markers detected from
      different types of OA bio-samples, and (2) an up-to-date summary of the
      tissue-specific OA studies that have utilised matrix-assisted laser
      desorption/ionisation mass spectrometry imaging (MALDI-MSI). Overall, these OA
      biomarkers could provide clinicians with information for better the diagnosis,
      and prognosis of individual patients, and ultimately help facilitate the
      development of disease-modifying treatments.

TI  - Point-of-care creatinine tests to assess kidney function for outpatients
      requiring contrast-enhanced CT imaging: systematic reviews and economic
      evaluation.
PG  - 1-248
LID - 10.3310/hta24390 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with low estimated glomerular filtration rates may be at
      higher risk of post-contrast acute kidney injury following contrast-enhanced
      computed tomography imaging. Point-of-care devices allow rapid measurement of
      estimated glomerular filtration rates for patients referred without a recent
      estimated glomerular filtration rate result. OBJECTIVES: To assess the clinical
      effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of point-of-care creatinine tests for
      outpatients without a recent estimated glomerular filtration rate measurement who
      need contrast-enhanced computed tomography imaging. METHODS: Three systematic
      reviews of test accuracy, implementation and clinical outcomes, and economic
      analyses were carried out. Bibliographic databases were searched from inception
      to November 2018. Studies comparing the accuracy of point-of-care creatinine
      tests with laboratory reference tests to assess kidney function in adults in a
      non-emergency setting and studies reporting implementation and clinical outcomes 
      were included. Risk of bias of diagnostic accuracy studies was assessed using a
      modified version of the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies 2
      (QUADAS-2) tool. Probabilities of individuals having their estimated glomerular
      filtration rates correctly classified were estimated within a Bayesian framework 
      and pooled using a fixed-effects model. A de novo probabilistic decision tree
      cohort model was developed to characterise the decision problem from an NHS and a
      Personal Social Services perspective. A range of alternative point-of-care
      testing approaches were considered. Scenario analyses were conducted. RESULTS:
      Fifty-four studies were included in the clinical reviews. Twelve studies reported
      diagnostic accuracy for estimated glomerular filtration rates; half were rated as
      being at low risk of bias, but there were applicability concerns for most. i-STAT
      (Abbott Point of Care, Inc., Princeton, NJ, USA) and ABL (Radiometer Ltd,
      Crawley, UK) devices had higher probabilities of correctly classifying
      individuals in the same estimated glomerular filtration rate categories as the
      reference laboratory test than StatSensor((R)) devices (Nova Biomedical, Runcorn,
      UK). There was limited evidence for epoc((R)) (Siemens Healthineers AG, Erlangen,
      Germany) and Piccolo Xpress((R)) (Abaxis, Inc., Union City, CA, USA) devices and 
      no studies of DRI-CHEM NX 500 (Fujifilm Corporation, Tokyo, Japan). The review of
      implementation and clinical outcomes included six studies showing practice
      variation in the management decisions when a point-of-care device indicated an
      abnormal estimated glomerular filtration rate. The review of cost-effectiveness
      evidence identified no relevant studies. The de novo decision model that was
      developed included a total of 14 strategies. Owing to limited data, the model
      included only i-STAT, ABL800 FLEX and StatSensor. In the base-case analysis, the 
      cost-effective strategy appeared to be a three-step testing sequence involving
      initially screening all individuals for risk factors, point-of-care testing for
      those individuals with at least one risk factor, and including a final
      confirmatory laboratory test for individuals with a point-of-care-positive test
      result. Within this testing approach, the specific point-of-care device with the 
      highest net benefit was i-STAT, although differences in net benefit with
      StatSensor were very small. LIMITATIONS: There was insufficient evidence for
      patients with estimated glomerular filtration rates < 30 ml/minute/1.73 m(2), and
      on the full potential health impact of delayed or rescheduled computed tomography
      scans or the use of alternative imaging modalities. CONCLUSIONS: A three-step
      testing sequence combining a risk factor questionnaire with a point-of-care test 
      and confirmatory laboratory testing appears to be a cost-effective use of NHS
      resources compared with current practice. The risk of contrast causing acute
      kidney injury to patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate of < 30
      ml/minute/1.73 m(2) is uncertain. Cost-effectiveness of point-of-care testing
      appears largely driven by the potential of point-of-care tests to minimise delays
      within the current computed tomography pathway. FUTURE WORK: Studies evaluating
      the impact of risk-stratifying questionnaires on workflow outcomes in computed
      tomography patients without recent estimated glomerular filtration rate results
      are needed. STUDY REGISTRATION: This study is registered as PROSPERO
      CRD42018115818. FUNDING: This project was funded by the National Institute for
      Health Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment programme and will be
      published in full in Health Technology Assessment; Vol. 24, No. 39. See the NIHR 
      Journals Library website for further project information.

OAB - Before computed tomography scans are done, a contrast agent is usually needed to 
      improve the visibility of internal body structures. After receiving a contrast
      agent (through a vein), some patients' kidneys may be affected, especially if
      their kidneys already do not work well. A blood test can identify these patients 
      before a computed tomography scan, to reduce the risk of kidney harm. The blood
      test measures creatinine, which is a marker of how well the kidneys work. Before 
      a contrast-enhanced computed tomography scan, some patients have a recent
      creatinine result from an earlier blood test. Blood tests are normally done in a 
      central laboratory, and usually take at least 1 hour. Other patients do not have 
      a recent creatinine result, so their computed tomography scan may be delayed or
      rearranged. Sometimes, to avoid risking kidney harm, patients may have scans
      without contrast. 'Point-of-care' (handheld, tabletop or portable) devices can
      quickly measure creatinine (usually in patients with risk factors), often from a 
      finger-prick blood sample. Many point-of-care devices are available but they may 
      not be as exact as laboratory tests, so their benefit is unclear. This study
      reviewed all available evidence on the benefits and harms of point-of-care
      creatinine tests before computed tomography scans and assessed whether or not
      they are a cost-effective use of NHS resources. The study found that some devices
      [i.e. i-STAT (Abbott Point of Care, Inc., Princeton, NJ, USA) and ABL (Radiometer
      Ltd, Crawley, UK)] were more accurate than others [i.e. StatSensor((R)) (Nova
      Biomedical, Runcorn, UK)]. There was insufficient evidence for other devices. The
      study found that, for outpatients, doing a point-of-care test in patients who are
      at a higher risk of kidney harm (according to a questionnaire) and then
      confirming this with a laboratory test appeared to be a cost-effective use of NHS
      resources. The study found that the risk of kidney harm as a result of contrast
      agents appears very low. The main benefit of point-of-care testing may be to
      reduce needless delays or rearranged computed tomography scan appointments.

TI  - Stepwise rapid tracking strategy to identify active molecules from Ixeris

AB  - In this study, a novel stepwise rapid tracking strategy was reported to identify 
      the active molecules from Ixeris sonchifolia Hance (IsH) in the treatment of
      coronary heart disease (CHD) based on "affinity mass spectrometry (MS)-atomic
      force microscopy (AFM) imaging" technology. First, vascular endothelial growth
      factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2) of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)
      signal transduction pathway located on the cell membrane was revealed to be the
      core target protein in CHD treatment through network pharmacology and
      bioinformatics. In addition, affinity MS screening based on VEGFR2 identified
      isochlorogenic acid A and luteolin-7-O-glucuronide as having stronger affinity
      with VEGFR2. Then, the active molecule was elucidated based on the observation
      that its actions accompanied the molecular morphological changes by AFM imaging
      and it could act on the binding pocket of VEGFR2 through molecular docking which 
      further demonstrated the analysis and inference of AFM imaging. The methyl
      thiazolyl tetrazolium (MTT) assay finally confirmed that the active molecules
      specifically combined with the potential core target protein to protect the
      viability of cardiomyocytes, which identified the main potential active molecules
      in IsH for the treatment of CHD and provided a possible mechanism for the
      protective role of the drug. The technology established in this study could
      facilitate the rapid tracing of potential active molecules in traditional Chinese
      medicine (TCM), which would provide further a reference for research on quality, 
      molecular mechanisms and new drugs.

AB  - At the time of this writing, searching Google Scholar for 'light-sheet
      microscopy' returns almost 8500 results; over three-quarters of which were
      published in the last 5 years alone. Searching for other advanced imaging methods
      in the last 5 years yields similar results: 'super-resolution microscopy' (>16
      000), 'single-molecule imaging' (almost 10 000), SPIM (Single Plane Illumination 
      Microscopy, 5000), and 'lattice light-sheet' (1300). The explosion of new imaging
      methods has also produced a dizzying menagerie of acronyms, with over 100
      different species of 'light-sheet' alone, from SPIM to UM (Ultra microscopy) to
      SiMView (Simultaneous MultiView) to iSPIM (inclined SPIM, not to be confused with
      iSPIM, inverted SPIM). How then is the average biologist, without an advanced
      degree in physics, optics, or computer science supposed to make heads or tails of
      which method is best suited for their needs? Let us also not forget the plight of
      the optical physicist, who at best might need help with obtaining healthy samples
      and keeping them that way, or at worst may not realize the impact their newest
      technique could have for biologists. This review will not attempt to solve all
      these problems, but instead highlight some of the most recent, successful mergers
      between biology and advanced imaging technologies, as well as hopefully provide
      some guidance for anyone interested in journeying into the world of live-cell
      imaging.

TI  - MRI-targeted prostate biopsy: key considerations for pathologists.
PG  - 18-25
LID - 10.1111/his.14113 [doi]
AB  - We discuss the role of the pathologist for MRI-targeted prostate biopsy with a
      focus on specimen processing, reporting of pathological findings and quality
      assurance in establishing a successful MRI-targeted biopsy programme. The authors
      discuss the current issues relevant to pathologists regarding MRI-targeted
      prostate biopsy. In addition, a brief review of the recently published literature
      was performed using an English literature search on PubMed with a focus on
      original investigations related to MRI-targeted prostate biopsy. Our search terms
      included the following: 'prostate cancer', 'pathology', 'histology', 'reporting',
      'cores', 'imaging', 'MRI' and 'mpMRI'. Prostate multiparametric magnetic
      resonance imaging (mp-MRI) and MRI-targeted biopsy has been shown to improve the 
      diagnosis of clinically significant prostatic adenocarcinoma and can affect the
      management of patients with prostate cancer. The current active surveillance
      guidelines were based on data from TRUS biopsies and not MRI-targeted biopsies.
      MRI-targeted biopsy acquires multiple cores of tissue from one or more suspicious
      lesions found on mp-MRI. The way in which multiple targeted core biopsies
      obtained from a single image-directed region of interest are analysed and
      reported can potentially alter the Gleason score and tumour burden as reported on
      biopsy, which could undoubtedly alter patient management. Pathologists play an
      important role in the reporting of MRI-targeted prostate biopsies. How we report 
      prostate cancer grade and extent on these biopsies can influence patient
      management. In addition, the pathologist should be involved in the quality
      assurance for patients undergoing MRI-targeted prostate biopsy.

TI  - Physician-level variation in clinical outcomes and resource use in inpatient
      general internal medicine: an observational study.
PG  - 123-132
LID - 10.1136/bmjqs-2019-010425 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Variations in inpatient medical care are typically attributed to
      system, hospital or patient factors. Little is known about variations at the
      physician level within hospitals. We described the physician-level variation in
      clinical outcomes and resource use in general internal medicine (GIM). METHODS:
      This was an observational study of all emergency admissions to GIM at seven
      hospitals in Ontario, Canada, over a 5-year period between 2010 and 2015.
      Physician-level variations in inpatient mortality, hospital length of stay,
      30-day readmission and use of 'advanced imaging' (CT, MRI or ultrasound scans)
      were measured. Physicians were categorised into quartiles within each hospital
      for each outcome and then quartiles were pooled across all hospitals (eg,
      physicians in the highest quartile at each hospital were grouped together). We
      report absolute differences between physicians in the highest and lowest
      quartiles after matching admissions based on propensity scores to account for
      patient-level variation. RESULTS: The sample included 103 085 admissions to 135
      attending physicians. After propensity score matching, the difference between
      physicians in the highest and lowest quartiles for in-hospital mortality was 2.4%
      (95% CI 0.6% to 4.3%, p<0.01); for readmission was 3.3% (95% CI 0.7% to 5.9%,
      p<0.01); for advanced imaging was 0.32 tests per admission (95% CI 0.12 to 0.52, 
      p<0.01); and for hospital length of stay was 1.2 additional days per admission
      (95% CI 0.5 to 1.9, p<0.01). Physician-level differences in length of stay and
      imaging use were consistent across numerous sensitivity analyses and stable over 
      time. Differences in mortality and readmission were consistent across most
      sensitivity analyses but were not stable over time and estimates were limited by 
      sample size. CONCLUSIONS: Patient outcomes and resource use in inpatient medical 
      care varied substantially across physicians in this study. Physician-level
      variations in length of stay and imaging use were unlikely to be explained by
      patient factors whereas differences in mortality and readmission should be
      interpreted with caution and could be explained by unmeasured confounders.
      Physician-level variations may represent practice differences that highlight
      quality improvement opportunities.

AB  - In this review, we focus on the applications of machine learning methods for
      analyzing image data acquired in imaging flow cytometry technologies. We propose 
      that the analysis approaches can be categorized into two groups based on the type
      of data, raw imaging signals or features explicitly extracted from images, being 
      analyzed by a trained model. We hope that this categorization is helpful for
      understanding uniqueness, differences and opportunities when the machine
      learning-based analysis is implemented in recently developed 'imaging' cell
      sorters.

TI  - Magnetic resonance imaging in non-conditional pacemakers and implantable
      cardioverter-defibrillators: a systematic review and meta-analysis.
PG  - 288-298
LID - 10.1093/europace/euz343 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: There is growing evidence that magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanning in
      patients with non-conditional cardiac implantable electronic devices (CIEDs) can 
      be performed safely. Here, we aim to assess the safety of MRI in patients with
      non-conditional CIEDs. METHODS AND RESULTS: English scientific literature was
      searched using PubMed/Embase/CINAHL with keywords of 'magnetic resonance
      imaging', 'pacemaker', 'implantable defibrillator', and 'cardiac
      resynchronization therapy'. Studies assessing outcomes of adverse events or
      significant changes in CIED parameters after MRI scanning in patients with
      non-conditional CIEDs were included. References were excluded if the MRI
      conditionality of the CIEDs was undisclosed; number of patients enrolled was <10;
      or studies were case reports/series. About 35 cohort studies with a total of 5625
      patients and 7196 MRI scans (0.5-3 T) in non-conditional CIEDs were included. The
      overall incidence of lead failure, electrical reset, arrhythmia, inappropriate
      pacing and symptoms related to pocket heating, or torque ranged between 0% and
      1.43%. Increase in pacing lead threshold >0.5 V and impedance >50Omega was seen
      in 1.1% [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.7-1.8%] and 4.8% (95% CI 3.3-6.4%)
      respectively. The incidence of reduction in P- and R-wave sensing by >50% was
      1.5% (95% CI 0.6-2.9%) and 0.4% (95% CI 0.06-1.1%), respectively. Battery voltage
      reduction of >0.04 V was reported in 2.2% (95% CI 0.2-6.1%). CONCLUSION: This
      meta-analysis affirms the safety of MR imaging in non-conditional CIEDs with no
      death or implantable cardioverter-defibrillator shocks and extremely low
      incidence of lead or device-related complications.

AB  - One of the missions of the European Association of Cardiovascular Imaging (EACVI)
      is 'to promote excellence in clinical diagnosis, research, technical development,
      and education in cardiovascular imaging'. The future of imaging involves
      multimodality so each imager should have the incentive and the possibility to
      improve its knowledge in other cardiovascular techniques. This article presents
      the results of a 20 questions survey carried out in cardiovascular imaging (CVI) 
      centres across Europe. The aim of the survey was to assess the situation of
      experience and training of CVI in Europe, the availability and organization of
      modalities in each centre and to ask for vision about potential improvements in
      CVI at national and European level.

TI  - Trends in scientific research in Insights into Imaging: a bibliometric review.
PG  - 79
LID - 10.1186/s13244-019-0766-y [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To analyse the coverage and main bibliometric indicators of Insights 
      into Imaging in Scopus and the Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI) from the
      Web of Science Core Collection database. METHODS: The evolution of journal
      production in the Scopus database was analysed according to document types,
      collaboration indexes between authors and institutions, and citation indicators
      (number of citations, SCImago Journal Rank, quartile, h-index, and most cited
      works). Networks of collaboration among authors, institutions, and countries were
      also analysed, as well as those of co-word networks. As a complementary source of
      information, the Emerging Source Citation Index from the Web of Science database 
      was also considered. RESULTS: Four hundred seventy-four papers were included in
      Scopus and 292 in ESCI. The index of collaboration was 5.18 for authors and 2.74 
      for institutions. International collaboration occurred in 24.7% of the papers.
      The number of citations received in Scopus (4295) exceeds the number of citations
      received in ESCI (1177). The average number of citations per paper was 9.06 in
      Scopus versus 4.03 in ESCI. The h-index was 29 in Scopus and 16 in ESCI. Several 
      collaborative groups were identified at the national and international level.
      CONCLUSIONS: There is a progression of Insights into Imaging in the ranking of
      journals in the area that, if maintained, will allow it to remain in the first
      quartile in the Scopus database. The main topics of interest were technologies
      such as 'Magnetic resonance imaging', 'Computed tomography', 'Radiology', and
      'Ultrasonography' and diseases such as 'Breast cancer' and those related to
      'Paediatrics'.

TI  - Selfie fundus imaging: Innovative approach to retinopathy screening.
PG  - 345-346
LID - 10.4103/0970-258X.262914 [doi]
AB  - The currently available methods of screening for diabetic retinopathy (DR) depend
      on the availability of healthcare professionals and technology. The high
      prevalence of diabetes in India, and the need to repeatedly screen such patients 
      for DR and treat them, places an enormous economic and logistic burden. We
      introduce the concept of screening for DR with 'selfie retinal imaging' through
      this report of 3 patients. The patients can themselves capture retinal images and
      transfer to a grading centre for further deliberation. If incorporated into the
      current technological revolution of smartphones, this futuristic concept is
      likely to be of huge benefit in preventing loss of vision due to diabetes.

TI  - Common Data Elements for Radiological Imaging of Patients with Subarachnoid
      Hemorrhage: Proposal of a Multidisciplinary Research Group.
PG  - 60-78
LID - 10.1007/s12028-019-00728-1 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Lack of homogeneous definitions for imaging data and consensus on
      their relevance in the setting of subarachnoid hemorrhage and unruptured
      intracranial aneurysms lead to a difficulty of data pooling and lack of robust
      data. The aim of the National Institute of Health/National Institute of
      Neurological Disorders and Stroke, Unruptured Intracranial Aneurysm (UIA) and
      Subarachnoid Hemorrhage (SAH) Common Data Elements (CDE) Project was to
      standardize data elements to ultimately facilitate data pooling and establish a
      more robust data quality in future neurovascular research on UIA and SAH.
      METHODS: For the subcommittee 'Radiological imaging of SAH,' international
      cerebrovascular specialists with imaging expertise in the setting of SAH were
      selected by the steering committee. CDEs were developed after reviewing the
      literature on neuroradiology and already existing CDEs for other neurological
      diseases. For prioritization, the CDEs were classified into 'Core,'
      'Supplemental-Highly Recommended,' 'Supplemental' and 'Exploratory.' RESULTS: The
      subcommittee compiled 136 CDEs, 100 out of which were derived from previously
      established CDEs on ischemic stroke and 36 were newly created. The CDEs were
      assigned to four main categories (several CDEs were assigned to more than one
      category): 'Parenchymal imaging' with 42 CDEs, 'Angiography' with 49 CDEs,
      'Perfusion imaging' with 20 CDEs, and 'Transcranial doppler' with 55 CDEs. The
      CDEs were classified into core, supplemental highly recommended, supplemental and
      exploratory elements. The core CDEs were imaging modality, imaging modality type,
      imaging modality vessel, angiography type, vessel angiography arterial anatomic
      site and imaging vessel angiography arterial result. CONCLUSIONS: The CDEs were
      established based on the current literature and consensus across cerebrovascular 
      specialists. The use of these CDEs will facilitate standardization and
      aggregation of imaging data in the setting of SAH. However, the CDEs may require 
      reevaluation and periodic adjustment based on current research and improved
      imaging quality and novel modalities.

AB  - Considered with a poor outcome of subarachnoid hemorrhage due to rupture of
      intracranial aneurysms (IAs), treatment interventions to prevent rupture of the
      lesions are mandatory for social health. As treatment option is limited to
      surgical manipulations, like microsurgical clipping, endovascular coiling or
      deployment of flow diverter, and these surgical interventions have a potential
      risk of complications in nature, a proper selection of rupture-prone IAs among
      ones incidentally found is essential. Today, a rupture risk in each case is
      estimated by several factors like patient characteristics and morphological ones 
      of each lesion. However, unfortunately, an IA without treatment sometimes
      unexpectedly ruptures resulting in a devastating outcome or an IA surgically
      treated is turned out to have a thick wall. To achieve more efficient treatment
      interventions, the development of a novel diagnostic modality is required. Here, 
      mainly through the accumulation of experimental findings, the crucial
      contribution of macrophage-mediated chronic inflammatory responses to IA
      progression have been revealed, making macrophage being a promising target for a 
      diagnosis. If we could non-invasively visualize accumulation of macrophages in
      lesions, this imaging technique 'macrophage imaging' may enable a qualitative
      evaluation of IAs to stratify rupture-prone 'dangerous' lesions among many stable
      ones. Thereby, a development of macrophage imaging makes an indication of
      surgical interventions being more accurate and also greatly facilitates a
      development of a novel medical therapy if used as a surrogate marker.

AB  - Physical therapists employ ultrasound (US) imaging technology for a broad range
      of clinical and research purposes. Despite this, few physical therapy regulatory 
      bodies guide the use of US imaging, and there are limited continuing education
      opportunities for physical therapists to become proficient in using US within
      their professional scope of practice. Here, we (i) outline the current status of 
      US use by physical therapists; (ii) define and describe four broad categories of 
      physical therapy US applications (ie, rehabilitation, diagnostic, intervention
      and research US); (iii) discuss how US use relates to the scope of high value
      physical therapy practice and (iv) propose a broad framework for a
      competency-based education model for training physical therapists in US. This
      paper only discusses US imaging-not 'therapeutic' US. Thus, 'imaging' is implicit
      anywhere the term 'ultrasound' is used.

TI  - Small choroidal melanoma: detection with multimodal imaging and management with
      plaque radiotherapy or AU-011 nanoparticle therapy.
PG  - 206-214
LID - 10.1097/ICU.0000000000000560 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To explore risk factors for choroidal nevus transformation
      into melanoma using multimodal imaging and review current treatment options.
      RECENT FINDINGS: A recently published longitudinal study of 3806 choroidal nevi, 
      imaged with optical coherence tomography (OCT), ultrasonography, and standard
      wavelength autofluorescence, revealed transformation into melanoma in 5.8% at 5
      years and 13.9% at 10 years, using Kaplan-Meier analysis. Multivariate factors
      predictive of transformation included thickness more than 2 mm (by
      ultrasonography), fluid subretinal (by OCT), symptoms vision loss (by Snellen
      acuity), orange pigment (by autofluorescence), melanoma hollow (by
      ultrasonography), and DIaMeter more than 5 mm (by photography). These important
      factors can be recalled by the mnemonic 'To Find Small Ocular Melanoma Doing
      IMaging' (TFSOM-DIM). The mean 5-year estimate of nevus growth into melanoma was 
      1.1% for those with 0 risk factor, 11% with one factor, 22% with two factors, 34%
      with three factors, 51% with four factors, and 55% with five risk factors.
      Management of small choroidal melanoma typically involves plaque radiotherapy
      with 5 and 10-year rates of tumor recurrence at 7 and 11%, visual acuity loss
      (>/=3 Snellen lines) at 39 and 49%, and melanoma-related metastasis at 4 and 9%. 
      A novel infrared dye-conjugated virus-like nanoparticle (AU-011) is currently
      under investigation for treatment of small choroidal melanoma, with a goal to
      induce tumor regression and minimize vision loss. SUMMARY: The mnemonic,
      TFSOM-DIM, can assist the clinician in detection of small choroidal melanoma.
      Treatment of small melanoma with plaque radiotherapy offers tumor control but
      with potential vision loss. A novel nanoparticle therapy using AU-011 is
      currently under trial.

TI  - Role of multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging for patients under active
      surveillance for prostate cancer: a systematic review with diagnostic
      meta-analysis.
PG  - 206-220
LID - 10.1038/s41391-018-0113-2 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The use of multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) in the 
      setting of patients under active surveillance (AS) is promising. In this
      systematic-review we aimed to analyse the role of mpMRI in patients under AS.
      METHODS: A comprehensive literature research for English-language original and
      review articles, recently published, was carried out using Medline, Scopus and
      Web of sciences databases until 30 October 2017. The following MeSH terms were
      used: 'active surveillance', 'prostate cancer', 'multiparametric magnetic
      resonance imaging'. A diagnostic meta-analysis was performed for 3.0 T mpMRI in
      predicting disease re-classification. RESULTS: In total, 226 studies were
      selected after research and after removal of duplicates. After analysis on
      inclusion criteria, 43 studies were identified as eligible for this systematic
      review with a total of 6,605 patients. The timing of MRI during follow-up of AS
      differed from all studies like criteria for inclusion in the AS protocol.
      Overall, there was a low risk of bias across all studies. The diagnostic
      meta-analysis for 1.5 tesla showed a sensitivity of 0.60, negative predictive
      value (NPV) of 0.75 and a hierarchical summary receiving operating curve (HSROC) 
      of 0.74 while for 3.0 tesla mpMRI a sensitivity of 0.81, a NPV of 0.78 and a
      HSROC of 0.83. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the available evidence suggests that both
      1.5 or 3.0 Tesla mpMRI are a valid tool to monitor progression during AS
      follow-up, showing good accuracy capabilities in detecting PCa re-classification.
      However, the modality to better define what means 'disease progression' on mpMRI 
      must be further evaluated.

TI  - An LED-based multi-actinic illumination system for the high throughput study of
      photosynthetic light responses.
PG  - e5589
LID - 10.7717/peerj.5589 [doi]
AB  - The responses of photosynthetic organisms to light stress are of interest for
      both fundamental and applied research. Functional traits related to the
      photoinhibition, the light-induced loss of photosynthetic efficiency, are
      particularly interesting as this process is a key limiting factor of
      photosynthetic productivity in algae and plants. The quantitative
      characterization of light responses is often time-consuming and calls for
      cost-effective high throughput approaches that enable the fast screening of
      multiple samples. Here we present a novel illumination system based on the
      concept of 'multi-actinic imaging' of in vivo chlorophyll fluorescence. The
      system is based on the combination of an array of individually addressable low
      power RGBW LEDs and custom-designed well plates, allowing for the independent
      illumination of 64 samples through the digital manipulation of both exposure
      duration and light intensity. The illumination system is inexpensive and easily
      fabricated, based on open source electronics, off-the-shelf components, and
      3D-printed parts, and is optimized for imaging of chlorophyll fluorescence. The
      high-throughput potential of the system is illustrated by assessing the
      functional diversity in light responses of marine macroalgal species, through the
      fast and simultaneous determination of kinetic parameters characterizing the
      response to light stress of multiple samples. Although the presented illumination
      system was primarily designed for the measurement of phenotypic traits related to
      photosynthetic activity and photoinhibition, it can be potentially used for a
      number of alternative applications, including the measurement of chloroplast
      phototaxis and action spectra, or as the basis for microphotobioreactors.

TI  - Radiologic approach to axial spondyloarthritis: where are we now and where are we
      heading?
PG  - 1753-1762
LID - 10.1007/s00296-018-4130-1 [doi]
AB  - Current emphasis on diagnosing axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA) in early stage
      enforced the search for sensitive and specific diagnostic algorithms with the use
      of imaging methods. The aim of this review was to summarise current
      recommendations concerning the use of imaging techniques in diagnostics and
      monitoring of axSpA as well as to outline possible future directions of the
      development in this field. MEDLINE database was searched between March and April 
      2018. In the first phase, such keywords were applied: 'ASAS', 'EULAR',
      'ASAS-EULAR', 'ASAS/OMERACT', 'axial spondyloarthritis', while in the second
      step: 'axial spondyloarthritis', 'ankylosing spondylitis', 'magnetic resonance
      imaging', 'computed tomography', and 'radiography', 'imaging'. An up-to-date
      summary of European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) recommendations enriched
      with recent updates of Assessment of Spondyloarthritis International Society
      (ASAS) diagnostic criteria regarding imaging in axSpA course was created.
      Moreover, we outlined the role of new in this field, promising imaging
      techniques, such as diffusion-weighted imaging and dynamic contrast-enhanced
      sequences in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or low-dose computed tomography
      (CT). As precise monitoring of axSpA activity is vital, we reviewed the most
      precise methods: semiquantitative scores (e.g., Spondyloarthritis Research
      Consortium of Canada scores or CT Syndesmophyte Score) and quantitative analysis 
      of MRI-based apparent diffusion coefficient or perfusion maps and enhancement
      curves. According to EULAR and ASAS recommendations, radiography and MRI still
      remain basic methods of axSpA diagnostics and monitoring. However, the knowledge 
      of state-of-the-art international guidelines combined with the awareness of
      emerging imaging methods is the key to effective management of axSpA.

AB  - Digital ulcers (DU) are a common manifestation of systemic sclerosis (SSc) and
      occur at a variety of locations including the fingertips and over the extensor
      aspects of the hands. However, most recent clinical trials have included only
      fingertip DUs as these are believed to be ischaemic in aetiology, and therefore
      likely to benefit from treatment with vasoactive drug therapies. There is an
      emerging evidence base to suggest that all DUs in SSc could share an ischaemic
      component which is potentially responsive to vascular therapy. Our hypothesis is 
      that is that DUs occurring at sites other than the fingertips, in particular,
      those overlying the extensor aspect of the hands, may also have a potentially
      reversible ischaemic component. We review the evidence under the headings:
      'microvascular imaging', 'structural microvascular' and, 'functional vascular
      disease', 'macrovascular involvement' and 'vascular associates'. Based upon the
      current evidence, we would encourage the expert SSc community to reconsider the
      rationale for including only fingertip DUs in future SSc clinical trials, and
      suggest an agenda for future research.

AB  - Imaging is an indispensable tool for brain tumour diagnosis, surgical planning,
      and follow-up. Definite diagnosis, however, often demands histopathological
      analysis of microscopic features of tissue samples, which have to be obtained by 
      invasive means. A non-invasive alternative may be to probe corresponding
      microscopic tissue characteristics by MRI, or so called 'microstructure imaging'.
      The promise of microstructure imaging is one of 'virtual biopsy' with the goal to
      offset the need for invasive procedures in favour of imaging that can guide
      pre-surgical planning and can be repeated longitudinally to monitor and predict
      treatment response. The exploration of such methods is motivated by the striking 
      link between parameters from MRI and tumour histology, for example the
      correlation between the apparent diffusion coefficient and cellularity. Recent
      microstructure imaging techniques probe even more subtle and specific features,
      providing parameters associated to cell shape, size, permeability, and volume
      distributions. However, the range of scenarios in which these techniques provide 
      reliable imaging biomarkers that can be used to test medical hypotheses or
      support clinical decisions is yet unknown. Accurate microstructure imaging may
      moreover require acquisitions that go beyond conventional data acquisition
      strategies. This review covers a wide range of candidate microstructure imaging
      methods based on diffusion MRI and relaxometry, and explores advantages,
      challenges, and potential pitfalls in brain tumour microstructure imaging.

AB  - The mandate of Committee 3 of the International Commission on Radiological
      Protection (ICRP) is concerned with the protection of persons and unborn children
      when ionising radiation is used in medical diagnosis, therapy, and biomedical
      research. Protection in veterinary medicine has been newly added to the mandate. 
      Committee 3 develops recommendations and guidance in these areas. The most recent
      documents published by ICRP that relate to radiological protection in medicine
      are 'Radiological protection in cone beam computed tomography' (ICRP Publication 
      129) and 'Radiological protection in ion beam radiotherapy' (ICRP Publication
      127). A report in cooperation with ICRP Committee 2 entitled 'Radiation dose to
      patients from radiopharmaceuticals: a compendium of current information related
      to frequently used substances' (ICRP Publication 128) has also been published.
      'Diagnostic reference levels in medical imaging' (ICRP Publication 135),
      published in 2017, provides specific advice on the setting and use of diagnostic 
      reference levels for diagnostic and interventional radiology, digital imaging,
      computed tomography, nuclear medicine, paediatrics, and multi-modality
      procedures. 'Occupational radiological protection in interventional procedures'
      was published in March 2018 as ICRP Publication 139. A document on radiological
      protection in therapy with radiopharmaceuticals is likely to be published in
      2018. Work is in progress on several other topics, including appropriate use of
      effective dose in collaboration with the other ICRP committees, guidance for
      occupational radiological protection in brachytherapy, justification in medical
      imaging, and radiation doses to patients from radiopharmaceuticals (an update to 
      ICRP Publication 128). Committee 3 is also considering the development of
      guidance on radiological protection in medicine related to individual
      radiosusceptibility, in collaboration with ICRP Committee 1.

AB  - The effects of varying LiPF6 salt concentration and the presence of lithium
      bis(oxalate)borate additive on the electronic structure of commonly used
      lithium-ion battery electrolyte solvents (ethylene carbonate-dimethyl carbonate
      and propylene carbonate) have been investigated. X-ray Raman scattering
      spectroscopy (a non-resonant inelastic X-ray scattering method) was utilized
      together with a closed-circle flow cell. Carbon and oxygen K-edges provide
      characteristic information on the electronic structure of the electrolyte
      solutions, which are sensitive to local chemistry. Higher Li(+) ion concentration
      in the solvent manifests itself as a blue-shift of both the pi* feature in the
      carbon edge and the carbonyl pi* feature in the oxygen edge. While these oxygen
      K-edge results agree with previous soft X-ray absorption studies on LiBF4 salt
      concentration in propylene carbonate, carbon K-edge spectra reveal a shift in
      energy, which can be explained with differing ionic conductivities of the
      electrolyte solutions.

      application in uveitis.
PG  - 1648
LID - 10.1038/s41598-018-20092-y [doi]
AB  - Detection and evaluation of inflammatory activity in uveitis is essential to the 
      management of the condition, and yet continues to be largely dependent on
      subjective clinical measures. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) measurement of
      vitreous activity is an alternative to clinical vitreous haze scoring and has
      passed a number of early validation studies. In this study we aimed to evaluate
      the impact of 'operator factors' on the variability of the technique as part of
      the validation process, and to help evaluate its suitability for 'real world'
      use. Vitreous haze index was calculated as a ratio between the reflectivity of
      the vitreous and of the outer retina in each scan. Different scanning conditions 
      were tested and their effect on the measurement is reported. Our results show
      that the 'quantitative imaging' technique of OCT-measured vitreous activity had
      good reliability in normal subjects under a range of 'real world' conditions,
      such as when the operator changes the averaging value. The technique was however 
      vulnerable to highly inaccurate focussing or abnormal downward displacement of
      the image. OCT-based quantification of vitreous activity is a promising
      alternative to current subjective clinical estimates, with sufficient 'tolerance'
      to be used in routine clinical practice as well as clinical trials.

AB  - Synchrotron radiation based nanoscopic X-ray fluorescence (SR nano-XRF) analysis 
      can visualize trace level elemental distribution in a fully quantitative manner
      within single cells. However, in-air XRF analysis requires chemical fixation
      modifying the cell's chemical composition. Here, we describe first nanoscopic XRF
      analysis upon cryogenically frozen (-150 degrees C) fibroblasts at the ID16A-NI
      'Nano-imaging' end-station located at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility
      (ESRF) in Grenoble (France). Fibroblast cells were obtained from skin biopsies
      from control and Friedreich's ataxia (FRDA) patients. FRDA is an autosomal
      recessive disorder with dysregulation of iron metabolism as a key feature. By
      means of the X-ray Fundamental Parameter (FP) method, including absorption
      correction of the ice layer deposited onto the fibroblasts, background-corrected 
      mass fraction elemental maps of P, S, Cl, K, Ca, Fe and Zn of entire cryofrozen
      human fibroblasts were obtained. Despite the presence of diffracting
      microcrystals in the vitreous ice matrix and minor sample radiation damage
      effects, clusters of iron-rich hot-spots with similar mass fractions were found
      in the cytoplasm of both control and FRDA fibroblasts. Interestingly, no
      significant difference in the mean iron concentration was found in the cytoplasm 
      of FRDA fibroblasts, but a significant decrease in zinc concentration. This
      finding might underscore metal dysregulation, beyond iron, in cells derived from 
      FRDA patients. In conclusion, although currently having slightly increased limits
      of detection (LODs) compared to non-cryogenic mode, SR based nanoscopic XRF under
      cryogenic sample conditions largely obliterates the debate on chemical sample
      preservation and provides a unique tool for trace level elemental imaging in
      single cells close to their native state with a superior spatial resolution of 20
      nm.

AB  - Uterine fibroids can severely impact a woman's quality of life, result in
      significant morbidity and are a leading indication for hysterectomy. Many aspects
      of the disease remain largely obscure. Despite these knowledge gaps, no detailed 
      maps of the global fibroid research architecture have yet been generated. This
      study used the NewQIS approach to assess worldwide research productivity,
      encompassing numerous aspects of the scientific output, quality and socioeconomic
      features. Regression analysis indicated an increase in fibroid research activity 
      in the investigated time periods. Global research output was dominated by leading
      Western countries, with the USA at the forefront, but also by East Asian
      countries. Socioeconomic benchmarking revealed that Taiwan had the highest
      fibroid research activity per GDP, with a calculated average of 279.46
      fibroid-related publications per 1000 billion USD GDP. Finland was the most
      active country with respect to research activity per population size. Subject
      area analyses revealed major differences in research focuses, for example
      'Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Medical Imaging' was assigned to 29.92% of South
      Korean and to only 10.38% of US-American publications. In conclusion, this
      analysis of global fibroid research activity illustrates a multitude of important
      features ranging from quantitative and semi-qualitative fibroid research aspects 
      to socioeconomic benchmarking.

AB  - A key feature of optoacoustic imaging is the ability to illuminate tissue at
      multiple wavelengths and therefore record images with a spectral dimension. While
      optoacoustic images at single wavelengths reveal morphological features, in
      analogy to ultrasound imaging or X-ray imaging, spectral imaging concedes sensing
      of intrinsic chromophores and externally administered agents that can reveal
      physiological, cellular and subcellular functions. Nevertheless, identification
      of spectral moieties within images obtained at multiple wavelengths requires
      spectral unmixing techniques, which present a unique mathematical problem given
      the three-dimensional nature of the optoacoustic images. Herein we discuss
      progress with spectral unmixing techniques developed for multispectral
      optoacoustic tomography. We explain how different techniques are required for
      accurate sensing of intrinsic tissue chromophores such as oxygenated and
      deoxygenated haemoglobin versus extrinsically administered photo-absorbing agents
      and nanoparticles. Finally, we review recent developments that allow accurate
      quantification of blood oxygen saturation (sO2) by transforming and solving the
      sO2 estimation problem from the spatial to the spectral domain.This article is
      part of the themed issue 'Challenges for chemistry in molecular imaging'.

AB  - Molecular imaging, where the location of molecules or nanoscale constructs can be
      tracked in the body to report on disease or biochemical processes, is rapidly
      expanding to include combined modality or multimodal imaging. No single imaging
      technique can offer the optimum combination of properties (e.g. resolution,
      sensitivity, cost, availability). The rapid technological advances in hardware to
      scan patients, and software to process and fuse images, are pushing the
      boundaries of novel medical imaging approaches, and hand-in-hand with this is the
      requirement for advanced and specific multimodal imaging agents. These agents can
      be detected using a selection from radioisotope, magnetic resonance and optical
      imaging, among others. Nanoparticles offer great scope in this area as they lend 
      themselves, via facile modification procedures, to act as multifunctional
      constructs. They have relevance as therapeutics and drug delivery agents that can
      be tracked by molecular imaging techniques with the particular development of
      applications in optically guided surgery and as radiosensitizers. There has been 
      a huge amount of research work to produce nanoconstructs for imaging, and the
      parameters for successful clinical translation and validation of therapeutic
      applications are now becoming much better understood. It is an exciting time of
      progress for these agents as their potential is closer to being realized with
      translation into the clinic. The coming 5-10 years will be critical, as we will
      see if the predicted improvement in clinical outcomes becomes a reality. Some of 
      the latest advances in combination modality agents are selected and the
      progression pathway to clinical trials analysed.This article is part of the
      themed issue 'Challenges for chemistry in molecular imaging'.

      mechanisms and a role for phosphorus.
LID - 20170180 [pii]
LID - 10.1098/rsta.2017.0180 [doi]
AB  - No discussion of challenges for chemistry in molecular imaging would be complete 
      without addressing the elephant in the room-which is that the purest of chemical 
      compounds needs to interact with a biological system in a manner that does not
      perturb normal biology while still providing efficacious feedback to assist in
      diagnosis of disease. In the past decade, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) agents
      long considered inert have produced adverse effects in certain patient
      populations under certain treatment regimens. More recently, inert blood pool
      agents have been found to deposit in the brain. Release of free metal is often
      suspected as the culprit but that hypothesis has yet to be validated. In
      addition, even innocuous agents can cause painful side effects during injection
      in some patients. In this brief review, we summarize known biological effects for
      gadolinium- and iron-based MRI contrast agents, and discuss some of the potential
      mechanisms for the observed biological effects, including the potential role of
      phosphorus imbalance, related to kidney disease or cancer, in destabilizing
      gadolinium-based chelates and precipitating free gadolinium.This article is part 
      of the themed issue 'Challenges for chemistry in molecular imaging'.

      catalytic prototropic exchange and quenching of the CEST signal.
LID - 20170113 [pii]
LID - 10.1098/rsta.2017.0113 [doi]
AB  - The CEST properties of EuDOTA-tetraamide complexes bearing pendant carboxylate
      and carboxyl ethyl esters were measured as a function of pH. The CEST signal from
      the Eu(3+)-bound water molecule decreased in intensity between pH 8.5 and 4.5
      while the proton exchange rates (kex) increased over this same pH range. In
      comparison, the CEST signal in the corresponding carboxyl ester derivatives was
      nearly constant. Both observations are consistent with stepwise protonation of
      the four carboxylic acid groups over this same pH range. This indicates that
      negative charges on the carboxyl groups above pH 6 facilitate the formation of a 
      strong hydrogen-bonding network in the coordination second sphere above the
      single Eu(3+)-bound water molecule, thereby decreasing prototropic exchange of
      protons on the bound water molecule with bulk water protons. The percentage of
      square antiprismatic versus twisted square antiprism coordination isomers also
      decreased as the appended carboxylic acid groups were positioned further away
      from the amide. The net effect of lowering the pH was an overall increase in kex 
      and a quenching of the CEST signal.This article is part of the themed issue

LID - 20170112 [pii]
LID - 10.1098/rsta.2017.0112 [doi]
AB  - Pharmaceutical research and development requires a systematic interrogation of a 
      candidate molecule through clinical studies. To ensure resources are spent on
      only the most promising molecules, early clinical studies must understand
      fundamental attributes of the drug candidate, including exposure at the target
      site, target binding and pharmacological response in disease. Molecular imaging
      has the potential to quantitatively characterize these properties in small,
      efficient clinical studies. Specific benefits of molecular imaging in this
      setting (compared to blood and tissue sampling) include non-invasiveness and the 
      ability to survey the whole body temporally. These methods have been adopted
      primarily for neuroscience drug development, catalysed by the inability to access
      the brain compartment by other means. If we believe molecular imaging is a
      technology platform able to underpin clinical drug development, why is it not
      adopted further to enable earlier decisions? This article considers current drug 
      development needs, progress towards integration of molecular imaging into
      studies, current impediments and proposed models to broaden use and increase
      impact.This article is part of the themed issue 'Challenges for chemistry in

AB  - Biomedical engineering and its associated disciplines play a pivotal role in
      improving our understanding and management of disease. Motivated by past
      accomplishments, such as the clinical implementation of coronary stents,
      pacemakers or recent developments in antibody therapies, disease management now
      enters a new era in which precision imaging and nanotechnology-enabled
      therapeutics are maturing to clinical translation. Preclinical molecular imaging 
      increasingly focuses on specific components of the immune system that drive
      disease progression and complications, allowing the in vivo study of potential
      therapeutic targets. The first multicentre trials highlight the potential of
      clinical multimodality imaging for more efficient drug development. In this
      perspective, the role of integrating engineering, nanotechnology, molecular
      imaging and immunology to yield precision medicine is discussed.This article is
      part of the themed issue 'Challenges for chemistry in molecular imaging'.

AB  - Molecular imaging (MI), used in its wider sense of biology at the molecular
      level, is a field that lies at the intersection of molecular biology and
      traditional medical imaging. As advances in medicine have exponentially expanded 
      over the last few decades, so has our need to better understand the fundamental
      behaviour of living organisms in a non-invasive and timely manner. This
      commentary draws from topics the authors addressed in their presentations at the 
      2017 Royal Society Meeting 'Challenges for chemistry in molecular imaging', as
      well as a discussion of where MI is today and where it is heading in the
      future.This article is part of the themed issue 'Challenges for chemistry in
      molecular imaging'.

AB  - Molecular imaging enables us to non-invasively visualize cellular functions and
      biological processes in living subjects, allowing accurate diagnosis of diseases 
      at early stages. For successful molecular imaging, a suitable contrast agent with
      high sensitivity is required. To date, various nanoparticles have been developed 
      as contrast agents for medical imaging modalities. In comparison with
      conventional probes, nanoparticles offer several advantages, including
      controllable physical properties, facile surface modification and long
      circulation time. In addition, they can be integrated with various combinations
      for multimodal imaging and therapy. In this opinion piece, we highlight recent
      advances and future perspectives of nanomaterials for molecular imaging.This
      article is part of the themed issue 'Challenges for chemistry in molecular
      imaging'.

TI  - Development of cyanine probes with dinitrobenzene quencher for rapid fluorogenic 
      protein labelling.
LID - 20170018 [pii]
LID - 10.1098/rsta.2017.0018 [doi]
AB  - A multicolour protein labelling technique using a protein tag and fluorogenic
      probes is a powerful approach for spatio-temporal analyses of proteins in living 
      cells. Since cyanine fluorophores have attractive properties for multicolour
      imaging of proteins, there is a huge demand to develop fluorogenic cyanine probes
      for specific protein labelling in living cells. Herein, we develop fluorogenic
      cyanine probes for labelling a protein tag by using a dinitrobenzene fluorescence
      quencher. The probes enhanced fluorescence intensity upon labelling reactions and
      emitted orange or far-red fluorescence. Intramolecular interactions between the
      cyanine fluorophores and the dinitrobenzene quencher led not only to fluorescence
      quenching of the probes in the free state but also to promotion of labelling
      reactions. Furthermore, the probes successfully imaged cell-surface proteins
      without a washing process. These findings offer valuable information on the
      design of fluorogenic cyanine probes and indicate that the probes are useful as
      novel live-cell imaging tools.This article is part of the themed issue
      'Challenges for chemistry in molecular imaging'.

PG  - 521-535
LID - 10.1017/S0007087417000656 [doi]
AB  - With the recent advent of systems biology, developmental biology is taking a new 
      turn. Attempts to create a 'digital embryo' are prominent among systems
      approaches. At the heart of these systems-based endeavours, variously described
      as 'in vivo imaging', 'live imaging' or 'in toto representation', are
      visualization techniques that allow researchers to image whole, live embryos at
      cellular resolution over time. Ultimately, the aim of the visualizations is to
      build a computer model of embryogenesis. This article examines the role of such
      visualization techniques in the building of a computational model, focusing, in
      particular, on the cinematographic character of these representations. It asks
      how the animated representation of development may change the biological
      understanding of embryogenesis. By situating the animations of the digital embryo
      within the iconography of developmental biology, it brings to light the
      inextricably entwined, yet shifting, borders between the animated, the living and
      the computational.

TI  - 'Non-standard' panoramic programmes and the unusual artefacts they produce.
PG  - 248-252
LID - 10.1038/sj.bdj.2017.707 [doi]
AB  - Dental panoramic radiographs (DPTs) are commonly taken in dental practice in the 
      UK with the number estimated to be 2.7 million per annum. They are used to
      diagnose caries, periodontal disease, trauma, pathology in the jaws,
      supernumerary teeth and for orthodontic assessment. Panoramic radiographs are not
      simple projections but involve a moving X-ray source and detector plate. Ideally 
      only the objects in the focal trough are displayed. This is achieved with a
      tomographic movement and one or more centre(s) of rotation. One advantage of
      digital radiography is hardware and software changes to optimise the image. This 
      has led to increasingly complex manufacturer specific digital panoramic
      programmes. Panoramic radiographs suffer from ghost artefacts which can limit the
      effectiveness and make interpretation difficult. Conversely 'conventional dental 
      imaging' such as intraoral bitewings do not suffer the same problems. There are
      also now several 'non-standard' panoramic programmes which aim to optimise the
      image for different clinical scenarios. These include 'improved
      interproximality', 'improved orthogonality' and 'panoramic bitewing mode'.This
      technical report shows that these 'non-standard' panoramic programmes can produce
      potentially confusing ghost artefacts, of which the practitioner may not be
      aware.

TI  - Alexithymia in multiple sclerosis: A systematic review of literature.
PG  - 31-47
LID - S0028-3932(17)30287-7 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2017.07.034 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Alexithymia is a multidimensional personality construct characterized
      by difficulties identifying and describing one's feelings, and externally
      oriented thinking. Although extensively reported in psychiatric patients, little 
      attention has been paid regarding its occurrence and its pathophysiology in the
      context of multiple sclerosis (MS). METHODS: A research was conducted according
      to the PRISMA guidelines aiming to identify original research articles in English
      and French languages about alexithymia in MS. Computerized databases (MEDLINE,
      PubMed, Scopus) were consulted. The key terms used were the following: ('multiple
      sclerosis' OR 'MS') AND ('alexithymia' OR 'alexithymic' OR 'emotion processing'
      OR 'emotion awareness' OR 'Toronto Alexithymia Scale' OR 'Bermond-Vorst
      Alexithymia Questionnaire') AND ('imaging' OR 'neuroimaging' OR 'magnetic
      resonance imaging' or 'MRI'). References of the retrieved papers were scanned
      manually aiming to get additional sources. RESULTS: 14 papers matched the above
      criteria. The prevalence of alexithymia in MS ranges from 10% to 53%. It seems to
      be associated with anxiety, depression, fatigue, and some social cognitive
      aspects. Its relationship with clinical and classical cognitive variables was
      rarely assessed. Finally, only one study has addressed its pathophysiology and
      has suggested an aberrant interhemispheric transfer. CONCLUSION: Admitting the
      prevalence of alexithymia in MS and its potential negative impact on the quality 
      of life and interpersonal communication, screening for it is relevant for a
      better management. Its relationship with clinical, emotional and cognitive
      confounders merits to be further evaluated. Large-scale studies, employing
      neuroimaging techniques, are greatly needed in order to disentangle the neural
      underpinnings of this trait in MS.

AB  - The concept of a critical nucleus size (r*) is of pivotal importance in phase
      transformations involving nucleation and growth. The current investigation
      pertains to crystallization in nanoscale thin films and study of the same using
      high resolution lattice fringe imaging (HRLFI) and finite element simulations.
      Using the CuZrAl bulk metallic glass system as a model system for this study, we 
      demonstrate a liquid like nucleation behaviour in nanoscale free-standing films
      upon heating. The r* for the formation of the Cu10Zr7 phase in thin films (of
      decreasing thickness) approaches that of the r* for the formation of the crystal 
      from a liquid (i.e.). Working in the nucleation dominant regime, we introduce the
      concept of 'depth sensitive lattice fringe imaging'. The thickness of the film is
      determined by electron energy loss spectroscopy and the strain energy of the
      system is computed using finite element computations.

TI  - MRI of the scrotum: Recommendations of the ESUR Scrotal and Penile Imaging
      Working Group.
PG  - 31-43
LID - 10.1007/s00330-017-4944-3 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The Scrotal and Penile Imaging Working Group (SPI-WG) appointed by
      the board of the European Society of Urogenital Radiology (ESUR) has produced
      recommendations for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the scrotum. METHODS: The
      SPI-WG searched for original and review articles published before September 2016 
      using the Pubmed and Medline databases. Keywords used were 'magnetic resonance
      imaging', 'testis or testicle or testicular', 'scrotum', 'intratesticular',
      'paratesticular', 'extratesticular' 'diffusion-weighted', 'dynamic MRI'.
      Consensus was obtained among the members of the subcommittee. The expert panel
      proposed recommendations using Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine 2011
      Levels of Evidence. RESULTS: The recommended MRI protocol should include T1-,
      T2-weighted imaging, diffusion-weighted imaging and dynamic contrast-enhanced
      MRI. Scrotal MRI can be clinically applied for lesion characterisation (primary),
      including both intratesticular and paratesticular masses, differentiation between
      germ-cell and non-germ-cell neoplasms (evolving), characterisation of the
      histological type of testicular germ cell neoplasms (TGCNs, in selected cases),
      local staging of TGCNs (primary), acute scrotum (in selected cases), trauma (in
      selected cases) and undescended testes (primary). CONCLUSIONS: The ESUR SPI-WG
      produced this consensus paper in which the existing literature on MRI of the
      scrotum is reviewed. The recommendations for the optimal imaging technique and
      clinical indications are presented. KEY POINTS: * This report presents
      recommendations for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the scrotum. * Imaging
      acquisition protocols and clinical indications are provided. * MRI is becoming
      established as a worthwhile second-line diagnostic tool for scrotal pathology.

TI  - Biomarkers and Surrogate Endpoints in Uveitis: The Impact of Quantitative
      Imaging.
PG  - BIO131-BIO140
LID - 10.1167/iovs.17-21788 [doi]
AB  - Purpose: Uveitis is a major cause of sight loss across the world. The reliable
      assessment of intraocular inflammation in uveitis ('disease activity') is
      essential in order to score disease severity and response to treatment. In this
      review, we describe how 'quantitative imaging', the approach of using automated
      analysis and measurement algorithms across both standard and emerging imaging
      modalities, can develop objective instrument-based measures of disease activity. 
      Methods: This is a narrative review based on searches of the current world
      literature using terms related to quantitative imaging techniques in uveitis,
      supplemented by clinical trial registry data, and expert knowledge of surrogate
      endpoints and outcome measures in ophthalmology. Results: Current measures of
      disease activity are largely based on subjective clinical estimation, and are
      relatively insensitive, with poor discrimination and reliability. The development
      of quantitative imaging in uveitis is most established in the use of optical
      coherence tomographic (OCT) measurement of central macular thickness (CMT) to
      measure severity of macular edema (ME). The transformative effect of CMT in
      clinical assessment of patients with ME provides a paradigm for the development
      and impact of other forms of quantitative imaging. Quantitative imaging
      approaches are now being developed and validated for other key inflammatory
      parameters such as anterior chamber cells, vitreous haze, retinovascular leakage,
      and chorioretinal infiltrates. Conclusions: As new forms of quantitative imaging 
      in uveitis are proposed, the uveitis community will need to evaluate these tools 
      against the current subjective clinical estimates and reach a new consensus for
      how disease activity in uveitis should be measured. The development, validation, 
      and adoption of sensitive and discriminatory measures of disease activity is an
      unmet need that has the potential to transform both drug development and routine 
      clinical care for the patient with uveitis.

TI  - Development toward high-resolution X-ray phase imaging.
PG  - 155-166
LID - 10.1093/jmicro/dfx013 [doi]
AB  - Since the 1990s, the use of X-ray phase contrast has been extensively studied for
      imaging weakly absorbing objects consisting of low-Z elements such as biological 
      soft tissues and polymers. The development of X-ray microscopy was also
      progressing during this time, although absorption contrast was only available. It
      was straightforward and important to develop phase-contrast X-ray microscopy. One
      characteristic in the development is that quantitative phase measurement is
      possible through the acquisition of phase-contrast images under a specific
      procedure, thanks to digital X-ray image detectors. Therefore, such a technique
      is called 'phase imaging' rather than phase-contrast imaging in this review.
      Highly sensitive three-dimensional phase imaging is feasible in combination with 
      tomography. This article reviews the progress in X-ray phase imaging, especially 
      with regards to X-ray microscopy.

TI  - Neural correlates of experimental trauma memory retrieval.
PG  - 3592-3602
LID - 10.1002/hbm.23613 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Traumatic memories such as intrusions and flashbacks play a major
      role in the development and maintenance of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
      A thorough understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying traumatic memories
      is indispensable for precise diagnosis, for personalized treatment and
      prevention. In particular, the identification of early neural predictor variables
      for intrusion development shortly after trauma exposure requires detailed
      investigation. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Here, we examined the neural correlates of
      early experimental trauma memory retrieval in a traumatic film paradigm in 42
      young healthy females, using both implicit and explicit retrieval tasks.
      PRINCIPAL OBSERVATIONS: We show that implicit experimental trauma retrieval
      specifically involved the retrosplenial cortex and the anterior cingulate cortex 
      (ACC), while both retrieval tasks resulted in trauma-related activity in the
      posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) and the precuneus. Importantly, neural activity 
      early after experimental trauma exposure predicted later intrusion development,
      with independent contributions from activity in the retrosplenial cortex
      (implicit retrieval) and the PCC (explicit retrieval). Additional analyses
      revealed a stronger connectivity between the bilateral amygdala and the
      supplementary motor area, precentral and paracentral lobule for the control group
      compared to the experimental trauma group. CONCLUSIONS: Our study gives new
      insights in the neural correlates of experimental trauma memory retrieval and
      their predictive value for subsequent symptom development. Our results could
      provide the basis for personalized early treatment and prevention of PTSD. Hum

TI  - Left main coronary artery stenosis: severity evaluation and implications for
      management.
PG  - 157-163
LID - 10.1080/14779072.2017.1294065 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The significant stenosis of the left main coronary artery is
      associated with poor outcomes and is considered a strong indication for
      revascularization. However, deciding whether the stenosis is significant can
      sometimes be challenging, especially when the degree of stenosis is intermediate,
      and can necessitate additional tests and imaging modalities. Areas covered: We
      did a literature search using keywords like 'left main', 'imaging',
      'intravascular ultrasound', 'fractional flow reserve', 'computed tomographic
      angiography' and 'magnetic resonance imaging'. The most commonly used methods for
      better characterizing intermediate left main coronary stenoses are intravascular 
      ultrasound and fractional flow reserve, while optical coherence tomography is the
      newer technique that provides better images, but for which not as much data is
      available. The noninvasive techniques are coronary computed tomographic
      angiography and, to a lesser degree, coronary magnetic resonance imaging. Expert 
      commentary: Accurately determining the severity of left main coronary stenosis
      can mean the difference between a major intervention and conservative therapy.

TI  - [Magnetic Resonance Imaging Conversion Predictors of Clinically Isolated Syndrome
      to Multiple Sclerosis].
PG  - 742-748
LID - 10.20344/amp.7650 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Clinically isolated syndrome may be the first manifestation of
      multiple sclerosis, a chronic demyelinating disease of the central nervous
      system, and it is defined by a single clinical episode suggestive of
      demyelination. However, patients with this syndrome, even with long term follow
      up, may not develop new symptoms or demyelinating lesions that fulfils multiple
      sclerosis diagnostic criteria. We reviewed, in clinically isolated syndrome, what
      are the best magnetic resonance imaging findings that may predict its conversion 
      to multiple sclerosis. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A search was made in the PubMed
      database for papers published between January 2010 and June 2015 using the
      following terms: 'clinically isolated syndrome', 'cis', 'multiple sclerosis',
      'magnetic resonance imaging', 'magnetic resonance' and 'mri'. RESULTS: In this
      review, the following conventional magnetic resonance imaging abnormalities found
      in literature were included: lesion load, lesion location, Barkhof's criteria and
      brain atrophy related features. The non conventional magnetic resonance imaging
      techniques studied were double inversion recovery, magnetization transfer
      imaging, spectroscopy and diffusion tensor imaging. DISCUSSION: The number and
      location of demyelinating lesions have a clear role in predicting clinically
      isolated syndrome conversion to multiple sclerosis. On the other hand, more data 
      are needed to confirm the ability to predict this disease development of non
      conventional techniques and remaining neuroimaging abnormalities. CONCLUSION: In 
      forthcoming years, in addition to the established predictive value of the above
      mentioned neuroimaging abnormalities, different clinically isolated syndrome
      neuroradiological findings may be considered in multiple sclerosis diagnostic
      criteria and/or change its treatment recommendations.

PG  - 75-82

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Anastomotic leak (AL) after colorectal surgery is a devastating
      complication; decreased blood perfusion is an important risk factor. Surgeons
      rely on subjective measures to assess bowel perfusion. Fluorescence imaging (FI) 
      with indocyanine green (ICG) provides a real-time objective assessment of
      intestinal perfusion. Areas covered: A PubMed search using the terms
      'fluorescence imaging', 'indocyanine green', 'colon and rectal surgery' was
      undertaken. Sixteen articles between 2010 to present were identified. Main
      outcomes were leak rate reduction, change in surgical plan, and technical
      feasibility. Change in surgical strategy due to FI was recorded in 11 studies.
      Two case control studies showed overall reduction of 4% and 12% in AL rate and
      one showed no change in AL rate between groups. Expert commentary: According to
      the available literature, FI is technically feasible and alters surgical strategy
      in a non-negligible number of patients possibly effecting AL rates.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The success of flap surgery is highly dependant of vascularisation,
      according to the principle of dermal and subdermal perfusion. This principle
      requires compatible dimensions for the survival of the flap. Indocyanine green
      angiography (ICG), a technique enabling an assessment of vascularization by
      fluorescence, has received a considerable impetus during the last two decades.
      The purpose of this article was to conduct a review on this technique and to
      evaluate its relevance in flap surgery. METHOD: We reviewed all articles
      referenced on PubMed from 1995 till 2015 using a search combining the terms
      'indocyanine green', 'flap', 'near-infrared', 'fluorescence', 'imaging' OR
      'angiography'. RESULTS: One hundred fifty five articles were found and among
      those thirty-four were selected. ICG is a reliable technique to locate perforants
      vessels, to determine the outlines of the flat and evaluate its per- and
      postoperative viability and to appraise anastomoses. CONCLUSION: This technique
      allows a reliable and real-time assessment of potential necrotic areas and an
      improvement in the detection of complications compared to conventional
      techniques.

TI  - Controversies in the management of deep neck space infection in children: an
      evidence-based review.
PG  - 156-163
LID - 10.1111/coa.12692 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Deep neck space infection (DNSI) is defined as infection in the
      potential spaces and fascial planes of the neck. Early recognition of DNSI can be
      challenging due to the complex head and neck anatomy; hence, a high index of
      suspicion is required to prevent a delay in diagnosis and appropriate management.
      OBJECTIVE OF REVIEW: There remains a lack of consensus on the management of
      paediatric DNSI with many advocating a more aggressive approach with immediate
      surgical drainage, while others favour a more conservative approach with medical 
      management in the first instance. The current literature on the management of
      paediatric DNSI is reviewed. TYPE OF REVIEW AND SEARCH STRATEGY: A literature
      review performed in November 2015 searched PubMed using the terms 'deep neck
      space', 'infection', 'paediatric', 'pediatric', 'children', 'imaging',
      'conservative', 'antibiotic' and 'surgery'. Articles not in the English language 
      were excluded. RESULTS: (i) Clinical presentation: Management of a compromised
      airway is the priority. Clinical history and examination enables the
      identification of the primary source of infection and presence of complications. 
      (ii) Investigations: Laboratory and microbiological investigations should be
      appropriately targeted, and CT imaging is the modality utilised in most cases.
      The presence of specific complications may warrant other imaging modalities.
      (iii) Antibiotics: An evidence-based antibiotic regime is proposed. (iv)
      Conservative treatment: In children lacking indications for surgical
      intervention, a trial 48 h of intravenous antibiotics (IV Abx) should be
      commenced. v) Surgical intervention: Indications include signs of airway
      compromise, presence of complications, no clinical improvement after 48 h of IV
      Abx, abscess >2.2 cm on CT imaging, age <4 years and ITU admission. CONCLUSIONS: 
      An appreciation of head and neck anatomy is vital to understanding disease
      pathology and potential complications of DNSI, which may be life threatening.
      Both conservative and surgical approaches are viable treatment options and may
      compliment each other. Current evidence suggests that clinical management should 
      be targeted towards the individual patient as factors such as age of the child
      may influence the balance of a conservative versus a surgical approach.

TI  - Vessel wall imaging for intracranial vascular disease evaluation.
PG  - 1154-1159
LID - 10.1136/neurintsurg-2015-012127 [doi]
AB  - Accurate and timely diagnosis of intracranial vasculopathies is important owing
      to the significant risk of morbidity with delayed and/or incorrect diagnosis both
      from the disease process and inappropriate therapies. Conventional luminal
      imaging techniques for analysis of intracranial vasculopathies are limited to
      evaluation of changes in the vessel lumen. Vessel wall MRI techniques can allow
      direct characterization of pathologic changes of the vessel wall. These
      techniques may improve diagnostic accuracy and improve patient outcomes.
      Extracranial carotid vessel wall imaging has been extensively investigated in
      patients with atherosclerotic disease and has been shown to accurately assess
      plaque composition and identify vulnerable plaque characteristics that may
      predict stroke risk beyond luminal stenosis alone. This review provides a brief
      history of vessel wall MRI, an overview of the intracranial vessel wall MRI
      techniques, its applications, and imaging findings of various intracranial
      vasculopathies pertinent to the neurointerventionalist, neurologist, and
      neuroradiologist. We searched MEDLINE, PubMed, and Google for English
      publications containing any of the following terms: 'intracranial vessel wall
      imaging', 'intracranial vessel wall', and 'intracranial vessel wall MRI'.
