TI  - Clinical role of fluorescence imaging in colorectal surgery - a review.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Anastomotic leak (AL) after colorectal surgery is a devastating
      complication; decreased blood perfusion is an important risk factor. Surgeons
      rely on subjective measures to assess bowel perfusion. Fluorescence imaging (FI) 
      with indocyanine green (ICG) provides a real-time objective assessment of
      intestinal perfusion. Areas covered: A PubMed search using the terms
      'fluorescence imaging', 'indocyanine green', 'colon and rectal surgery' was
      undertaken. Sixteen articles between 2010 to present were identified. Main
      outcomes were leak rate reduction, change in surgical plan, and technical
      feasibility. Change in surgical strategy due to FI was recorded in 11 studies.
      Two case control studies showed overall reduction of 4% and 12% in AL rate and
      one showed no change in AL rate between groups. Expert commentary: According to
      the available literature, FI is technically feasible and alters surgical strategy
      in a non-negligible number of patients possibly effecting AL rates.

TI  - Controversies in the management of deep neck space infection in children: an
      evidence-based review.
PG  - 156-163
LID - 10.1111/coa.12692 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Deep neck space infection (DNSI) is defined as infection in the
      potential spaces and fascial planes of the neck. Early recognition of DNSI can be
      challenging due to the complex head and neck anatomy; hence, a high index of
      suspicion is required to prevent a delay in diagnosis and appropriate management.
      OBJECTIVE OF REVIEW: There remains a lack of consensus on the management of
      paediatric DNSI with many advocating a more aggressive approach with immediate
      surgical drainage, while others favour a more conservative approach with medical 
      management in the first instance. The current literature on the management of
      paediatric DNSI is reviewed. TYPE OF REVIEW AND SEARCH STRATEGY: A literature
      review performed in November 2015 searched PubMed using the terms 'deep neck
      space', 'infection', 'paediatric', 'pediatric', 'children', 'imaging',
      'conservative', 'antibiotic' and 'surgery'. Articles not in the English language 
      were excluded. RESULTS: (i) Clinical presentation: Management of a compromised
      airway is the priority. Clinical history and examination enables the
      identification of the primary source of infection and presence of complications. 
      (ii) Investigations: Laboratory and microbiological investigations should be
      appropriately targeted, and CT imaging is the modality utilised in most cases.
      The presence of specific complications may warrant other imaging modalities.
      (iii) Antibiotics: An evidence-based antibiotic regime is proposed. (iv)
      Conservative treatment: In children lacking indications for surgical
      intervention, a trial 48 h of intravenous antibiotics (IV Abx) should be
      commenced. v) Surgical intervention: Indications include signs of airway
      compromise, presence of complications, no clinical improvement after 48 h of IV
      Abx, abscess >2.2 cm on CT imaging, age <4 years and ITU admission. CONCLUSIONS: 
      An appreciation of head and neck anatomy is vital to understanding disease
      pathology and potential complications of DNSI, which may be life threatening.
      Both conservative and surgical approaches are viable treatment options and may
      compliment each other. Current evidence suggests that clinical management should 
      be targeted towards the individual patient as factors such as age of the child
      may influence the balance of a conservative versus a surgical approach.
