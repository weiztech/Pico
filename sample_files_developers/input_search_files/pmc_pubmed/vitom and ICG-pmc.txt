TI  - A pilot study of near-infrared fluorescence guided surgery for primary tumor
      localization and lymph node mapping in colorectal cancer.
LID - 1342
AB  - Background: This pilot study aimed to evaluate the feasibility of near-infrared
      fluorescence imaging for primary tumor localization, lymph node mapping, and
      metastatic lymph node detection in colorectal cancer (CRC) using indocyanine
      green (ICG). Methods: A total of 11 patients with CRC were prospectively
      enrolled. ICG (25 mg dissolved in 30 mL sterile water) was intravenously injected
      preoperatively, and the fluorescence intensity of the primary tumor, lymph nodes,
      and normal tissues, as well as the signal-to-background ratio (SBR) and
      contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) were measured at 0.5, 1, 2, 4, and 24 h after ICG
      injection. Results: The primary tumor could be located intraoperatively, and the 
      tumor boundary was clear at 2–4 h. There was good contrast in the fluorescence
      intensity between tumor and normal tissues (SBR =2.11±0.36, CNR =8.74±0.35). The 
      lymph node detection rate was 95% (38/40), and the SBR threshold of lymph nodes
      was 1.13. Conclusions: This pilot study showed that primary tumor localization
      and lymph node mapping in CRC is feasible using near-infrared fluorescence
      imaging technology, though metastatic lymph nodes cannot be discriminated from
      benign ones. In addition, cancer nodules missed by both white light mode and
      palpation by the surgeon were unexpectedly found, resulting in a change in the
      surgical prognosis in 9.1% (1/11) of patients.

TI  - Evaluation of a Novel Three-Dimensional Robotic Digital Microscope (Aeos) in
      Neurosurgery.
LID - 4273
AB  - Simple Summary: Current literature debates the development and implementation of 
      three-dimensional Exoscopes in the daily routine of neurosurgical practice. This 
      study evaluates the grade of satisfaction and intraoperative handling of the
      novel Aesculap Aeos Three-Dimensional Robotic Digital Microscope used in a
      Neurosurgical Department in the daily practice in a larger series of
      neurosurgical procedures. Our evaluation of this modern microscope technology
      focuses on three central aspects of microsurgical procedures. First, the
      visualization of tumor tissue and its discernment from healthy tissue, which is
      of utmost importance during neurooncological procedures. Furthermore, the aspect 
      of ergonomics and fatigue during long, repetitive surgical procedures have been
      shown to cause work-related musculoskeletal disorders. Finally, the
      implementation of novel three-dimensional microscopes may be a promising tool for
      surgical education. Improved image quality, superior ergonomic comfort for the
      surgeon and increased accessibility within the surgical field have been noted as 
      major advantages to date. Abstract: Objective: Current literature debates the
      role of newly developed three-dimensional (3D) Exoscopes in the daily routine of 
      neurosurgical practice. So far, only a small number of cadaver lab studies or
      case reports have examined the novel Aesculap Aeos Three-Dimensional Robotic
      Digital Microscope. This study aims to evaluate the grade of satisfaction and
      intraoperative handling of this novel system in neurosurgery. Methods: Nineteen
      neurosurgical procedures (12 cranial, 6 spinal and 1 peripheral nerve) performed 
      over 9 weeks using the Aeos were analyzed. Ten neurosurgeons of varying levels of
      training were included after undergoing device instruction and training.
      Following every surgery, a questionnaire consisting of 43 items concerning
      intraoperative handling was completed. The questionnaires were analyzed using
      descriptive statistics. Results: No intraoperative complications occurred.
      Surgical satisfaction was ranked high (78.95%). In total, 84.21% evaluated
      surgical ergonomics as satisfactory, while 78.95% of the surgeons would like to
      use this system frequently. Image quality, independent working zoom function and 
      depth of field were perceived as suboptimal by several neurosurgeons. Conclusion:
      The use of Aeos is feasible and safe in microsurgical procedures, and surgical
      satisfaction was ranked high among most neurosurgeons in our study. The system
      might offer advanced ergonomic conditions in comparison to conventional
      ocular-based microscopes.

TI  - Meta-analysis Comparing Fluorescence Imaging with Radioisotope and Blue
      Dye-Guided Sentinel Node Identification for Breast Cancer Surgery.
PG  - 3738-48
AB  - Introduction: Conventional methods for axillary sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB)
      are fraught with complications such as allergic reactions, skin tattooing,
      radiation, and limitations on infrastructure. A novel technique has been
      developed for lymphatic mapping utilizing fluorescence imaging. This
      meta-analysis aims to compare the gold standard blue dye and radioisotope (BD-RI)
      technique with fluorescence-guided SLNB using indocyanine green (ICG). Methods:
      This study was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42019129224). The MEDLINE, EMBASE,
      Scopus, and Web of Science databases were searched using the Medical Subject
      Heading (MESH) terms ‘Surgery’ AND ‘Lymph node’ AND ‘Near infrared fluorescence’ 
      AND ‘Indocyanine green’. Studies containing raw data on the sentinel node
      identification rate in breast cancer surgery were included. A heterogeneity test 
      (using Cochran’s Q) determined the use of fixed- or random-effects models for
      pooled odds ratios (OR). Results: Overall, 1748 studies were screened, of which
      10 met the inclusion criteria for meta-analysis. ICG was equivalent to
      radioisotope (RI) at sentinel node identification (OR 2.58, 95% confidence
      interval [CI] 0.35–19.08, p < 0.05) but superior to blue dye (BD) (OR 9.07, 95%
      CI 6.73–12.23, p < 0.05). Furthermore, ICG was superior to the gold standard
      BD-RI technique (OR 4.22, 95% CI 2.17–8.20, p < 0.001). Conclusion: Fluorescence 
      imaging for axillary sentinel node identification with ICG is equivalent to the
      single technique using RI, and superior to the dual technique (RI-BD) and single 
      technique with BD. Hospitals using RI and/or BD could consider changing their
      practice to ICG given the comparable efficacy and improved safety profile, as
      well as the lesser burden on hospital infrastructure. Electronic supplementary

TI  - Micro- and macro-borderless surgery using a newly developed high-resolution (4K) 
      three-dimensional video system.
LID - e0250559
AB  - Objective: Microsurgery using conventional optical microscopes or surgical loupes
      features a limited field of view and imposes a serious strain on surgeons
      especially during long surgeries. Here we advocate the micro- and
      macro-borderless surgery (MMBS) using a novel high-resolution (4K)
      three-dimensional (3D) video system. This study aimed to confirm the
      applicability of this concept in several surgical procedures. Methods: We
      evaluated the possible use and efficacy of MMBS in the following experiments in
      porcine subjects. Experiment 1 (non-inferiority test) consisted of dissection and
      anastomosis of carotid artery, portal vein, proper hepatic artery, and
      pancreatoduodenectomy with surgical loupe versus MMBS. Experiment 2 (feasibility 
      test) consisted of intra-abdominal and intra-thoracic smaller arteries
      anastomosed by MMBS as a pre-clinical setting. Experiment 3 (challenge on new
      surgery) consisted of orthotopic liver transplantation of the graft from a donor 
      after circulatory death maintained by machine perfusion. Circulation of the
      cardiac sheet with a vascular bed in experiment 2 and liver graft during
      preservation in experiment 3 was evaluated with indocyanine green fluorescence
      imaging equipped with this system. Results: Every procedure was completed by
      MMBS. The operator and assistants could share the same field of view in heads-up 
      status. The focal depth was deep enough not to be disturbed by pulsing blood
      vessels or respiratory movement. The tissue circulation could be evaluated using 
      fluorescence imaging of this system. Conclusions: MMBS using the novel system is 
      applicable to various surgeries and valuable for both fine surgical procedures
      and high-level surgical education.

TI  - Exploratory Study of the Clinical Value of Near-Infrared Sentinel Lymph Node
      Mapping With Indocyanine Green in Vulvar Cancer Patients.
LID - 652458
AB  - Background: This study aimed to evaluate the clinical value of indocyanine green 
      sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping in patients with vulvar cancer. The
      conventional procedure of SLN mapping in vulvar cancer includes peritumoral
      injection of technetium-99m nanocolloid before surgery and intraoperative
      injection of a blue dye. However, these techniques harbor some limitations.
      Near-infrared fluorescence imaging with indocyanine green has gained popularity
      in SLN mapping in different types of cancer. Methods: We analyzed retrospectively
      vulvar cancer patients at our institution between 2013 and 2020 undergoing
      indocyanine green SLN mapping by applying video telescope operating microscope
      system technology. Results: 64 groins of 34 patients were analyzed. In 53 groins 
      we used technetium-99m nanocolloid, in four patent blue, and in five both
      techniques, additionally to indocyanine green for SLN detection. In total, 120
      SLNs were identified and removed. The SLN detection rate of indocyanine green was
      comparable to technetium-99m nanocolloid (p=.143) and higher than patent blue
      (p=.003). The best results were achieved using a combination of ICG and
      technetium-99m nanocolloid (detection rate of 96.9%). SLN detection rates of
      indocyanine green were significantly higher in patients with positive lymph nodes
      (p=.035) and lymphatic space invasion (p=.004) compared to technetium-99m
      nanocolloid. Conclusion: Indocyanine green SLN mapping in vulvar cancer is
      feasible and safe, with reasonable detection rates. Due to its easy application
      and few side effects, it offers a sound alternative to the conventional SLN
      mapping techniques in vulvar cancer. In patients with lymph node metastasis,
      indocyanine green even outperformed technetium-99m nanocolloid in terms of
      detection rate.

TI  - Current Advances in Robotics for Head and Neck Surgery—A Systematic Review.
LID - 1398
AB  - Simple Summary: The means of therapy in oncologic diseases have been developing
      continuously over the past years, intending to improve the overall survival and
      quality of life of affected patients. In head and neck oncology the surgical
      therapy is one of the key pillars in curative treatment. The standardized
      surgical techniques are supplemented and improved by the application of technical
      devices. The ambition is the reduction in peri- and postoperative morbidity,
      hospitalization time, and the enhancement of functional outcome. In other
      surgical specialties, the application of robotics is widely seen as standard. The
      purpose of this review is to outline the current status of robotics in head and
      neck surgery in the context of the present literature, to demonstrate reasonable 
      application fields, and to discuss the expenditure of the usage of such tools.
      Furthermore, this review offers an overview of current research in this field.
      Abstract: Background. In the past few years, surgical robots have recently
      entered the medical field, particularly in urology, gynecology, and general
      surgery. However, the clinical effectiveness and safety of robot-assisted surgery
      (RAS) in the field of head and neck surgery has not been clearly established. In 
      this review, we evaluate to what extent RAS can potentially be applied in head
      and neck surgery, in which fields it is already daily routine and what advantages
      can be seen in comparison to conventional surgery. Data sources. For this
      purpose, we conducted a systematic review of trials published between 2000 and
      2021, as well as currently ongoing trials registered in clinicaltrials.gov. The
      results were structured according to anatomical regions, for the topics “Costs,” 
      “current clinical trials,” and “robotic research” we added separate sections for 
      the sake of clarity. Results. Our findings show a lack of large-scale systematic 
      randomized trials on the use of robots in head and neck surgery. Most studies
      include small case series or lack a control arm which enables a comparison with
      established standard procedures. Conclusion. The question of financial
      reimbursement is still not answered and the systems on the market still require
      some specific improvements for the use in head and neck surgery.

TI  - VITOM 4K 3D Exoscope: A Preliminary Experience in Thyroid Surgery.
LID - e12694
AB  - Since its introduction in 2008, the Karl Storz 4K 3D VITOM® exoscope (Karl
      Storz SE & Co. KG, Tuttlingen, Germany) has been successfully used in various
      surgical disciplines. This paper describes our department’s experience using this
      technology and its use in the first total thyroidectomy case. The set up of the
      3D VITOM exoscope in the operating theatre allows for a user-friendly approach to
      thyroid surgery with the exoscope placed out of the line of sight of the surgeon 
      with a monitor placed directly ahead. The surgeon has a control panel within
      reach, which allows for adjustments to image magnification and focus. The use of 
      the 3D VITOM exoscope has the potential to confer significant improvements in
      patient outcomes by promoting efficient and safer surgery through superior
      operative visualisation.

TI  - A Pilot Study Evaluating the Effects of Magtrace® for Sentinel Node Biopsy in
      Breast Cancer Patients Regarding Care Process Optimization, Reimbursement,
      Surgical Time, and Patient Comfort Compared With Standard Technetium99.
PG  - 3232-40
AB  - Background: Sentinel lymph node biopsy after technetium-99 (Tc99) localization is
      a mainstay of oncologic breast surgery. The timing of Tc99 injection can
      complicate operating room schedules, which can cause increasing overall costs of 
      care and patient discomfort. Methods: This study compared 59 patients who
      underwent breast cancer surgery including sentinel lymph node biopsy. Based on
      the surgeon’s choice, 29 patients were treated with Tc99, and 30 patients
      received the iron-based tracer, Magtrace. The primary outcomes were time spent on
      the care pathway and operating time from commissioning of the probe to removal of
      the sentinel node. The secondary outcomes were patient pain levels and
      reimbursement. Results: The mean time spent on the preoperative breast cancer
      care pathway was significantly shorter for the Magtrace group (5.4 ± 1.3 min)
      than for the Tc99 group (82 ± 20 min) (p < 0.0001). The median time from probe
      usage to sentinel node extirpation was slightly but not significantly shorter in 
      the Magtrace group (5 min; interquartile range [IQR], 3–15 min vs 10 min; IQR,
      7–15 min; p = 0.151). Reimbursement and pain levels remained unchanged, and the
      hospital length of stay was similar in the two groups (Magtrace: 5.1 ± 2.3 days
      vs Tc99: 4.5 ± 3.2 days). Conclusions: Magtrace localization shortened the
      preoperative care pathway and did not affect surgical time or reimbursement. Once
      established, it could allow for cost reduction and improve patient comfort.

TI  - Sentinel lymph node mapping with indocyanine green in cervical cancer patients
      undergoing open radical hysterectomy: a single-institution series.
PG  - 649-59
AB  - Purpose: To assess the rate of bilateral sentinel lymph node (SLN) detection with
      indocyanine green (ICG), to evaluate the sensitivity and the negative predictive 
      value of cervical cancer patients undergoing open radical hysterectomy; to
      compare open versus minimally invasive SLN biopsy performance and to assess
      factors related to no/unilateral SLN mapping. Methods: We retrospectively
      reviewed consecutive patients with FIGO 2018 stage IA1 with lymph-vascular space 
      involvement to IIB and IIIC1p cervical carcinoma who underwent SLN mapping with
      ICG followed by systematic pelvic lymphadenectomy between 05/2017 and 06/2020.
      Patients were divided according to surgical approach for statistical analysis.
      Results: Eighty-five patients met inclusion criteria. Twenty-seven (31.8%)
      underwent open and 58 (68.2%) underwent minimally invasive SLN mapping. No
      difference in any SLN mapping (laparotomy 92.6% and minimally invasive 91.4%) or 
      in SLN bilateral detection (laparotomy 72.0% and minimally invasive 84.9%)
      (p = 0.850 and p = 0.222, respectively), in median number of SLNs mapped and
      retrieved (2 in both groups, p = 0.165) and in site of SLN mapping per
      hemi-pelvis (right side, p = 0273 and left side, p = 0.618) was evident between
      open and minimally invasive approach. Per-patient sensitivity of SLN biopsy in
      laparotomy was 83.3% (95% CI 35.9–99.6%) and the negative predictive value was
      95.0% (95% CI 76.0–99.1%). No difference in per-patient sensitivity was noted
      between two approaches (p = 0.300). None of the analyzed variables was associated
      with no/unilateral SLN mapping. Conclusion: The use of ICG to detect SLN in
      cervical cancer treated with open surgery allows a bilateral detection,
      sensitivity and negative predictive value comparable to minimally invasive
      surgery with potential advantages of ICG compared to other tracers. Electronic

TI  - Indocyanine Green Fluorescence Versus Blue Dye or Radioisotope Regarding
      Detection Rate of Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy and Nodes Removed in Breast Cancer: 
      A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.
PG  - 1187-95
AB  - Background:: Either blue dye (BD) or radioisotope (RI) is mainly used for
      sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) in breast cancer patients. Unlike the BD, RI
      has lower false-negative rate of SLNB. However, its lymphoscintigraphy,
      difficulty in preoperative injection, and undetected sentinel lymph nodes in some
      cases cause surgeons to rely only on BD. Currently, indocyanine green (ICG)
      fluorescence method (ICG-SLNB) is increasingly used as an alternative to the
      conventional mapping methods in many centers. This systematic review compared ICG
      with the conventional method of BD or RI in terms of detection rate of SLNB and
      the number of sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) removed in. Methods: : We searched all 
      relevant studies published between January 2000 and October 2019. All data on for
      evaluation of SLN detection rate, number of SLNs removed per patient, and tumor
      positive rate of SLNB were extracted. Results:: A total of 30 studies, including 
      4,216 SLN procedures were retrieved. There was a statistically significant
      difference between ICG and BD method in terms of SLN detection rate (OR, 6.73;
      95% CI, 4.20-10.78). However, there was no significant difference between ICG and
      RI in this regard (OR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.40-2.03). The number of SLNs removed per
      patient were 2.35 (1.46-5.4), 1.92 (1.0-3.64), and 1.72 (1.35-2.08) for ICG, BD, 
      and RI, respectively. Only in 8 studies, the tumor positive rates in SLNB could
      be analyzed (ICG, 8.5-20.7%; BD, 12.7-21.4%; RI, 11.3-16%). Conclusion:: ICG-SLNB
      could be an additional or an alternative method for axillary node mapping in
      breast cancer.

TI  - Real-Time Fluorescence Imaging in Thoracic Surgery.
PG  - 205-20
AB  - Near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence imaging provides a safe and cost-efficient
      method for immediate data acquisition and visualization of tissues, with
      technical advantages including minimal autofluorescence, reduced photon
      absorption, and low scattering in tissue. In this review, we introduce recent
      advances in NIR fluorescence imaging systems for thoracic surgery that improve
      the identification of vital tissues and facilitate the resection of tumorous
      tissues. When coupled with appropriate NIR fluorophores, NIR fluorescence imaging
      may transform current intraoperative thoracic surgery methods by enhancing the
      precision of surgical procedures and augmenting postoperative outcomes through
      improvements in diagnostic accuracy and reductions in the remission rate.

TI  - Preliminary experience with a digital robotic exoscope in cranial and spinal
      surgery: a review of the Synaptive Modus V system.
PG  - 2175-80
AB  - Background: The microscope is the standard tool for microneurosurgery worldwide. 
      However, the reduced illumination of the surgical field with the use of a
      conventional microscope during surgeries of deeply located pathologies remains
      unaddressed. Accordingly, different exoscope systems have recently been
      introduced in clinical practice. Here, we report our initial experience with the 
      digital 2-dimensional Synaptive Modus V exoscope system in spinal and cranial
      surgery. Methods: During a 2-week period between 27 September to 11 October 2018,
      we used the Synaptive Modus V exoscope system and performed eight neurosurgical
      procedures including spine (n = 4) and cranial procedures (n = 4). Visual
      quality, depth perception, complications, switching to microscope comfort level
      of the surgeon, and learning curve during surgery were evaluated. Results: A
      total of eight procedures were performed, namely, vestibular schwannoma (n = 1), 
      skull base meningioma (n = 1), olfactory groove meningioma (n = 1), tentorial
      meningioma (n = 1), anterior cervical discectomy (n = 1), cervical laminectomy
      (n = 1), and lumbar disc herniation (n = 2). The overall results were comparable 
      to the operative microscope with better visual quality and greater comfort for
      the surgeon. Conclusion: The Synaptive Modus V system is a safe tool to perform
      common spinal surgeries and intracranial tumor resection. Image quality is better
      than a microscope but with slightly less depth perception. Vigorous training in
      the laboratory may be helpful before clinical use. Electronic supplementary

TI  - Intraoperative biophotonic imaging systems for image-guided interventions.
PG  - 99-116
AB  - Biophotonic imaging has revolutionized the operation room by providing surgeons
      intraoperative image-guidance to diagnose tumors more efficiently and to resect
      tumors with real-time image navigation. Among many medical imaging modalities,
      near-infrared (NIR) light is ideal for image-guided surgery because it penetrates
      relatively deeply into living tissue, while nuclear imaging provides quantitative
      and unlimited depth information. It is therefore ideal to develop an integrated
      imaging system by combining NIR fluorescence and gamma-positron imaging to
      provide surgeons with highly sensitive and quantitative detection of diseases,
      such as cancer, in real-time without changing the look of the surgical field. The
      focus of this review is to provide recent progress in intraoperative biophotonic 
      imaging systems, NIR fluorescence imaging and intraoperative nuclear imaging
      devices, and their future perspectives for image-guided interventions.

TI  - Usefulness of colonic tattooing using indocyanine green in patients with
      colorectal tumors.
PG  - 632-40
AB  - AIM: To prove that tattooing using indocyanine green (ICG) is feasible in
      laparoscopic surgery for a colon tumor. METHODS: From January 2012 to December
      2016, all patients who underwent laparoscopic colonic surgery were
      retrospectively screened, and 1010 patients with colorectal neoplasms were
      included. Their lesions were tattooed with ICG the day before the operation. The 
      tattooed group (TG) included 114 patients, and the non-tattooed group (NTG) was
      selected by propensity score matching of subjects based on age, sex, tumor
      staging, and operation method (n = 228). In total, 342 patients were enrolled.
      Between the groups, the changes in [Delta (Δ), preoperative-postoperative] the
      hemoglobin and albumin levels, operation time, hospital stay, oral ingestion
      period, transfusion, and perioperative complications were compared. RESULTS:
      Preoperative TG had a shorter operation time (174.76 ± 51.6 min vs 192.63 ± 59.9 
      min, P < 0.01), hospital stay (9.55 ± 3.36 d vs 11.42 ± 8.23 d, P < 0.01), and
      post-operative oral ingestion period (1.58 ± 0.96 d vs 2.81 ± 1.90 d, P < 0.01). 
      The Δ hemoglobin (0.78 ± 0.76 g/dL vs 2.2 ± 1.18 g/dL, P < 0.01) and Δ albumin
      (0.41 ± 0.44 g/dL vs 1.08 ± 0.39 g/dL, P < 0.01) levels were lower in the TG. On 
      comparison of patients in the “N0” and “N1 or N2” groups, the N0 colon cancer
      group had a better operation time, length of hospital stay, oral ingestion
      period, Δ hemoglobin, and Δ albumin results than those of the N1 or N2 group. The
      operation methods affected the results, and laparoscopic anterior resection (LAR)
      showed similar results. However, for left and right hemicolectomy, both groups
      showed no difference in operation time or hospital stay. CONCLUSION: Preoperative
      tattooing with ICG is useful for laparoscopic colectomy, especially in the N0
      colon cancer group and LAR.

TI  - The Utility of Intraoperative Near Infrared Fluorescence (NIR) Imaging with
      Indocyanine Green (ICG) for the Assessment of Kidney Allograft Perfusion.
LID - 6703056
AB  - Background: Near infrared light (NIR) fluorescence imaging with indocyanine green
      (ICG) has been used in various aspects of surgery, such as in the assessment of
      vascular anastomosis, tissue perfusion, and the identification of lymph nodes. In
      this study we evaluated the utility of NIR/ICG fluorescence imaging in kidney
      transplantation. Materials and Methods: NIR/ICG imaging was used to assess
      allograft perfusion in n=1 living donor (LDRT) and n=2 deceased donor (DDRT)
      renal transplantations, performed in February 2017. The allograft arterial and
      venous anastomoses were done end-to-side to the corresponding recipient external 
      iliacs, and ureteroneocystostomies were performed for urinary reconstructions.
      After completion of vascular anastomosis, ICG was given as intravenous bolus at
      0.3mg/kg, followed by visual assessment of tissue perfusion and vascular
      anastomoses at 1-minute interval using fluorescence imaging (KARL STORZ NIR/ICG
      System). Results: Homogenous global fluorescence of the allograft and vascular
      anastomosis was observed in all 3 cases. Immediate postoperative perfusion
      studies showed patent inflow and outflow vessels and well perfused transplanted
      kidneys. Immediate graft function was observed in 2 recipients (1 LDRT and 1
      DDRT). One session of haemodialysis was performed in 1 DDRT recipient, for high
      serum potassium in the immediate postoperative setting, who otherwise had good
      urine output and serially declining serum creatinine. Conclusions: NIR/ICG
      fluorescence imaging can be useful in renal transplantation for the
      intraoperative assessment of allograft perfusion, especially in complex cases
      with multiple renal arteries and vascular reconstructions.

TI  - Indocyanine green fluorescence angiography during liver and pancreas
      transplantation: a tool to integrate perfusion statement’s evaluation.
PG  - 161-6
AB  - Background: Indocyanine green (ICG) fluorescence imaging is a promising tool for 
      intraoperative decision-making during surgical procedures, in particular to
      assess organs perfusion. Methods: We used the ICG fluorescence during liver
      transplantations in six cirrhotic patients to help assessing the graft biliary
      duct perfusion in order to identify the appropriate level to perform the
      anastomosis. We also used ICG fluorescence also in five patients receiving
      kidney-pancreas transplantation to evaluate the perfusion levels of the duodenal 
      stump of the pancreas graft. Results: Follow-up period for the patients was 12
      months. The perioperative period was uneventful, no biliary complications such as
      leaks or stenosis were reported after liver transplantation, no complications of 
      the entero-enteric anastomoses occurred after pancreatic transplantation.
      Conclusions: ICG fluorescence seems to safely provide important objectifiable
      perfusion information during organ transplantation procedures that can integrate 
      surgeon’s expertise. In fact, detecting intra-operatively perfusion defects, it
      allows real time modifications on technical strategies potentially useful to
      reduce the feared risk of anastomotic leakage and consequent severe
      complications.

TI  - Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy in Breast Cancer Patients by Means of Indocyanine
      Green Using the Karl Storz VITOM® Fluorescence Camera.
LID - 6251468
AB  - Currently, the use of radioisotope and blue dye for sentinel lymph node biopsy
      (SLNB) for axillary staging in breast cancer is common. Recently, indocyanine
      green (ICG) has been proposed as an alternative sentinel lymph node (SLN)
      tracking agent. We evaluated the clinical value of ICG as an additional tracer in
      combination with Technetium99m and as an alternative to Technetium99m for the
      identification of SLN in 104 breast cancer patients. 21 patients had at least 1
      histologically tumor-positive SLN. All 21 patients were detected by ICG; in one
      of these 21 sentinel-positive patients, Technetium99m was unable to identify
      lymph node involvement. Our results show that ICG is as effective as the
      radioisotope for SLNB. In addition, as a near-infrared dye, it has the advantages
      of real-time visualization, lower cost, and wider availability, since no
      radioactive material needs to be handled. This trial is registered with German
      Clinical Trial Register Main ID: DRKS00013606.

TI  - Hybrid intraoperative imaging techniques in radioguided surgery: present clinical
      applications and future outlook.
PG  - 323-41
AB  - Purpose: This review aims to summarise the hybrid modality radioguidance
      techniques currently in clinical use and development, and to discuss possible
      future avenues of research. Due to the novelty of these approaches, evidence of
      their clinical relevance does not yet exist. The purpose of this review is to
      inform nuclear medicine practitioners of current cutting edge research in
      radioguided surgery which may enter standard clinical practice within the next
      5–10 years. Hybrid imaging is of growing importance to nuclear medicine
      diagnostics, but it is only with recent advances in technology that hybrid
      modalities are being investigated for use during radioguided surgery. These
      modalities aim to overcome some of the difficulties of surgical imaging while
      maintaining many benefits, or providing entirely new information unavailable to
      surgeons with traditional radioguidance. Methods: A literature review was carried
      out using online reference databases (Scopus, PubMed). Review articles obtained
      using this technique were citation mined to obtain further references. Results:
      In total, 2367 papers were returned, with 425 suitable for further assessment. 60
      papers directly related to hybrid intraoperative imaging in radioguided surgery
      are reported on. Of these papers, 25 described the clinical use of hybrid
      imaging, 22 described the development of new hybrid probes and tracers, and 13
      described the development of hybrid technologies for future clinical use. Hybrid 
      gamma–NIR fluorescence was found to be the most common clinical technique, with
      35 papers associated with these modalities. Other hybrid combinations include
      gamma–bright field imaging, gamma–ultrasound imaging, gamma–β imaging and β–OCT
      imaging. The combination of preoperative and intraoperative images is also
      discussed. Conclusion: Hybrid imaging offers new possibilities for assisting
      clinicians and surgeons in localising the site of uptake in procedures such as in
      sentinel node detection.

TI  - Sentinel Lymph Nodes Mapping in Cervical Cancer a Comprehensive Review.
PG  - 154-8
AB  - Objective: A comprehensive literature search for more recent studies pertaining
      to sentinel lymph node mapping in the surveillance of cervical cancer to assess
      if sentinel lymph node mapping has sensitivity and specificity for evaluation of 
      the disease; assessment of posttreatment response and disease recurrence in
      cervical cancer. Materials and Methods: The literature review has been
      constructed on a step wise study design that includes 5 major steps. This
      includes search for relevant publications in various available databases,
      application of inclusion and exclusion criteria for the selection of relevant
      publications, assessment of quality of the studies included, extraction of the
      relevant data and coherent synthesis of the data. Results: The search yielded
      numerous studies pertaining to sentinel lymph node mapping, especially on the
      recent trends, comparison between various modalities and evaluation of the
      technique. Evaluation studies have appraised high sensitivity, high negative
      predictive values and low false-negative rate for metastasis detection using
      sentinel lymph node mapping. Comparative studies have established that of all the
      modalities for sentinel lymph node mapping, indocyanine green sentinel lymph node
      mapping has higher overall and bilateral detection rates. Corroboration of the
      deductions of these studies further establishes that the sentinel node detection 
      rate and sensitivity are strongly correlated to the method or technique of
      mapping and the history of preoperative neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Conclusions:
      The review takes us to the strong conclusion that sentinel lymph node mapping is 
      an ideal technique for detection of sentinel lymph nodes in cervical cancer
      patients with excellent detection rates and high sensitivity. The review also
      takes us to the supposition that a routine clinical evaluation of sentinel lymph 
      nodes is feasible and a real-time florescence mapping with indocyanine green dye 
      gives better statistically significant overall and bilateral detection than
      methylene blue.
