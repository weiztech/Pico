TI  - Cryo‐FIB preparation of whole cells and tissue for cryo‐TEM: use of high‐pressure
      frozen specimens in tubes and planchets.
PG  - 125-37
AB  - The desire to study macromolecular complexes within their cellular context
      requires the ability to produce thin samples suitable for cryo‐TEM
      (cryo‐transmission electron microscope) investigations. In this paper, we discuss
      two similar approaches, which were developed independently in Utrecht (the
      Netherlands) and Albany (USA). The methods are particularly suitable for both
      tissue samples and cell suspensions prepared by a high‐pressure freezer (HPF).
      The workflows are explained with particular attention to potential pitfalls,
      while underlying principles are highlighted (‘why to do so’). Although both
      workflows function with a high success rate, full execution requires considerable
      experience and remains demanding. In addition, throughput is low. We hope to
      encourage other research groups worldwide to take on the challenge of improving
      the HPF– cryo‐FIB‐SEM – cryo‐TEM workflow. We discuss a number of suggestions to 
      this end. Lay Description: Life is ultimately dictated by the interaction of
      molecules in our bodies. Highly complex equipment is being used and further
      developed to study these interactions. The present paper describes methods to
      prepare small, very thin lamellae (area of 5×5 µm2, thickness 50–300 nm) of a
      cell to be studied in a cryo‐transmission electron microscope (cryo‐TEM). Special
      care must be taken to preserve the natural state of molecules in their natural
      environment. In the case of cryo‐TEM, the samples must be frozen and kept frozen 
      to be compatible with the vacuum conditions in the microscope. The frozen
      condition imposes technical challenges which are addressed. Two approaches to
      obtain the thin lamellae are described. Both make use of a focused ion beam (FIB)
      microscope. The FIB allows removal of material with nanometre precision by
      focusing a beam of ionised atoms (gallium ions) onto the sample. Careful control 
      of the FIB allows cutting out of the required thin lamellae. In both strategies, 
      the thin lamellae remain attached to the original sample, and the ensemble of
      sample with section and sample holder is transported from the FIB microscope to
      the TEM while being kept frozen.

TI  - Bimodal magnetic resonance and optical imaging of extracellular matrix
      remodelling by orthotopic ovarian tumours.
PG  - 216-25
AB  - Background: The extracellular matrix modulates the development of ovarian
      tumours. Currently, evaluation of the extracellular matrix in the ovary is
      limited to histological methods. Both magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and
      two-photon microscopy (2PM) enable dynamic visualisation and quantification of
      fibrosis by endogenous contrast mechanisms: magnetisation transfer (MT) MRI and
      second-harmonic generation (SHG) 2PM, respectively. Methods: Here, we applied the
      MT-MRI protocol for longitudinal imaging of the stroma in orthotopic human
      ovarian cancer ES-2 xenograft model in CD1 athymic nude mice, and for
      orthotopically implanted ovarian PDX using a MR-compatible imaging window chamber
      implanted into NSG mice. Results: We observed differences between ECM deposition 
      in ovarian and skin lesions, and heterogeneous collagen distribution in ES-2
      lesions. An MR-compatible imaging window chamber enabled visual matching between 
      T2 MRI maps of orthotopically implanted PDX grafts and anatomical images of their
      microenvironment acquired with a stereomicroscope and SHG–2PM intravital
      microscopy of the collagen. Bimodal MRI/2PM imaging allowed us to quantify the
      fibrosis within the same compartments, and demonstrated the consistent results
      across the modalities. Conclusions: This work demonstrates a novel approach for
      measuring the stromal biomarkers in orthotopic ovarian tumours in mice, on both
      macroscopic and microscopic levels.

TI  - Technique, protocols and adverse reactions for contrast-enhanced spectral
      mammography (CESM): a systematic review.
LID - 76
AB  - We reviewed technical parameters, acquisition protocols and adverse reactions
      (ARs) for contrast-enhanced spectral mammography (CESM). A systematic search in
      databases, including MEDLINE/EMBASE, was performed to extract publication year,
      country of origin, study design; patients; mammography unit/vendor, radiation
      dose, low-/high-energy tube voltage; contrast molecule, concentration and dose;
      injection modality, ARs and acquisition delay; order of views; examination time. 
      Of 120 retrieved articles, 84 were included from 22 countries (September
      2003–January 2019), totalling 14012 patients. Design was prospective in 44/84
      studies (52%); in 70/84 articles (83%), a General Electric unit with factory-set 
      kVp was used. Per-view average glandular dose, reported in 12/84 studies (14%),
      ranged 0.43–2.65 mGy. Contrast type/concentration was reported in 79/84 studies
      (94%), with Iohexol 350 mgI/mL mostly used (25/79, 32%), dose and flow rate in
      72/84 (86%), with 1.5 mL/kg dose at 3 mL/s in 62/72 studies (86%). Injection was 
      described in 69/84 articles (82%), automated in 59/69 (85%), manual in 10/69
      (15%) and flush in 35/84 (42%), with 10–30 mL dose in 19/35 (54%). An examination
      time < 10 min was reported in 65/84 studies (77%), 120 s acquisition delay in
      65/84 (77%) and order of views in 42/84 (50%) studies, beginning with the
      craniocaudal view of the non-suspected breast in 7/42 (17%). Thirty ARs were
      reported by 14/84 (17%) studies (26 mild, 3 moderate, 1 severe non-fatal) with a 
      pooled rate of 0.82% (fixed-effect model). Only half of CESM studies were
      prospective; factory-set kVp, contrast 1.5 mL/kg at 3 mL/s and 120 s acquisition 
      delay were mostly used; only 1 severe AR was reported. CESM protocol
      standardisation is advisable.

TI  - Historical influence on the practice of chiropractic radiology: part II -
      thematic analysis on the opinions of diplomates of the American Chiropractic
      College of Radiology about the future.
LID - 15
AB  - Background: Over the past 20 years, various authors have addressed the question
      of the future of chiropractic. Most were positive about the future, with some
      advocating evidence-based practice and integration with mainstream healthcare,
      some advocating continued separation with an emphasis on subluxation-based care
      or the traditional/historical paradigm of chiropractic, and some calling for
      tolerance and unity. No papers were found specifically inquiring about the future
      of chiropractic radiology. Methods: The study population consisted of all current
      members of the American Chiropractic College of Radiology (ACCR), estimated at
      190 people, known as chiropractic radiologists or Diplomates of the American
      Chiropractic Board of Radiology (DACBRs). An internet-based, anonymous survey
      using SurveyMonkey was implemented, supplemented by hard copies distributed at a 
      conference. The main point of interest for this paper is the final item of the
      overall questionnaire. This item inquired about the future of chiropractic
      radiology. Thematic analysis was used on the responses, coded in both
      constructionist and inductive ways to extract both a general outlook and more
      specific themes. The inductive themes were also assigned secondarily to a SWOT
      (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats) analysis. Results: The
      overall response rate to the survey was 38% (73/190); within the group of
      respondents, 71 of 73 (98%) answered the item that is the subject of this paper. 
      Opinions on the outlook for chiropractic radiology in the future were more
      negative than positive, with 14 respondents giving a positive outlook, 26
      negative, and 14 non-committal. 28 respondents advocated integration with the
      wider healthcare community, 11 recommended emphasising separateness or a focus on
      working within chiropractic, and 15 did not express an opinion on this issue. Ten
      strengths were noted, 11 weaknesses, 57 opportunities, and 30 threats.
      Conclusions: The increasing necessity of demonstrating evidence for diagnostic
      and therapeutic procedures in healthcare makes it likely that chiropractic
      radiologists and the wider chiropractic profession will need to take a more
      active position on evidence-based practice. Re-evaluation of guidelines and
      legislation as well as enforcement policies and practices will be necessary. The 
      consequences of failing to do so may include increased marginalisation and
      reduced viability as a profession. Electronic supplementary material: The online
