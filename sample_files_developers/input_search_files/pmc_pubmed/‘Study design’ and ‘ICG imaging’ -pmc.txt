TI  - A physical approach to model occlusions in the retinal microvasculature.
PG  - 189-94
AB  - Blood occlusions in the retinal microvasculature contribute to the pathology of
      many disease states within the eye. These events can cause haemorrhaging and
      retinal detachment, leading to a loss of vision in the affected patient. Here, we
      present a physical approach to characterising the collective cell dynamics
      leading to plug formation, through the use of a bespoke microfluidic device, and 
      through the derivation of a probabilistic model. Our microfluidic device is based
      on a filtration design that can tune the particle volume fraction of a flowing
      suspension within a conduit, with sizes similar to arterioles. This allows us to 
      control and reproduce an occlusive event. The formation of the occlusion can be
      examined through the extracted motion of particles within the channel, which
      enables the assessment of individual and collective particle dynamics in the time
      leading to the clogging event. In particular, we observe that at the onset of the
      occlusion, particles form an arch bridging the channel walls. The data presented 
      here inform the development of our mathematical model, which captures the
      essential factors promoting occlusions, and notably highlights the central role
      of adhesion in these processes. Both the physical and probabilistic models rely
      on significant approximations, and future investigation will seek to assess these
      approximations, including the deformability and complex flow profiles of the
      blood constituents. However, we anticipate that the general mechanisms of
      occlusion may be elucidated from these simple models. As microvascular flows in
      the eye can now be measured in vivo and non-invasively with single cell
      resolution, our model will also be compared to the pathophysiological
      characteristics of the human microcirculation.
