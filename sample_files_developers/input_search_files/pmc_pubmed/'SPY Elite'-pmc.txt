TI  - Digital higher education: a divider or bridge builder? Leadership perspectives on
      edtech in a COVID-19 reality.
LID - 51
AB  - The edtech community has promoted claims that digital education enhances access, 
      learning, and collaboration. The COVID-19 pandemic tested these claims like never
      before, as higher education systems seemingly overnight had to move teaching
      online. Through a sequential mixed-method approach, we investigated how 85 higher
      education leaders in 24 countries experienced this rapid digital transformation. 
      Through their experiences, we identified the multiple and overlapping factors
      that contribute to an institution’s ability to realize the potential of digital
      education, in terms of access, learning and collaboration, whilst highlighting
      deeply rooted inequalities at the individual, institutional and system level.
      Drawing on these empirics, we put forth recommendations for closing the digital
      divides and pathways forward. Higher education leaders are uniquely positioned to
      move beyond the emergency adoption of online learning towards inclusive,
      long-term visions for digital education, which emphasize collaboration over
      individual gain.Supplementary Information: The online version contains

TI  - Emotions in Indian music history: anxiety in late Mughal Hindustan.
PG  - 182-205
AB  - Music’s ability to stimulate the emotions has long been fundamental to the
      aesthetics and reception of India’s elite rāga-based traditions. These emotions
      are generally studied aesthetically through the lens of ‘rasa’: the Sanskrit
      theory that proposes the musician’s role is to stimulate one of nine distilled
      emotional essences (rasas) that is ‘tasted’ by the audience. But here I ask the
      inverse question: what emotions arose when historical listeners were threatened
      with the loss of that crucial source of emotional stimulus; and how were those
      negative emotions expressed through historical texts? In this paper, I consider
      the Hayy al-Arwāh, a music treatise and tazkira (biographical collection) written
      by an ex-Mughal official from Delhi living in exile in Patna c. 1785–88, Miyan
      Zia-ud-din ‘Zia’. Zia-ud-din’s work reveals much about the emotions felt by
      musicians and music lovers affected by the violent political upheaval centred on 
      late Mughal Delhi c1740–80 – but not in obvious ways. For such an emotional
      subject, his writing is curiously dispassionate. Nevertheless, I argue that his
      writing was impelled by one very powerful emotion in particular: anxiety. In
      order to approach the question I examine some alternative ways we might get at
      the emotional resonances of texts like the Hayy al-Arwāh: through genre, in this 
      case the tazkira; the etic observations of modern neuroscience; and a turn
      outwards to writings of more emotionally loquacious contemporaries, here the Urdu
      poet Mir Taqi ‘Mir’. I argue it is precisely Zia-ud-din’s detatched attention to 
      detail, as he traced hundreds of lost and scattered musicians and listeners, that
      reveals the emotional driving force behind the writing of the Hayy al-Arwāh to be
      a deep and abiding anxiety engendered by the very real existential threat of war 
      and exile to the music of late Mughal Delhi. In writing the Hayy al-Arwāh,
      Zia-ud-din acted as witness and record keeper for his community to insure against
      the potential loss of the music of his beloved homeland. At the same time, the
      work of gathering and reporting information acted to alleviate his anxiety over
      the threatened disappearance of what was to him a most important source of
      personal solace.

TI  - The uneven distribution of futurity: Slow emergencies and the event of COVID‐19.
LID - 10.1111/1745-5871.12501
AB  - The ongoing COVID‐19 pandemic strains conventional temporal imaginaries through
      which emergencies are typically understood and governed. Rather than a
      transparent and linear temporality, a smooth transition across the series
      event/disruption–response–post‐event recovery, the pandemic moves in fits and
      starts, blurring the boundary between normalcy and emergency. This distended
      temporality brings into sharp relief other slow emergencies such as racism,
      poverty, biodiversity loss, and climate change, which inflect how the pandemic is
      known and governed as an emergency. In this article, we reflect on COVID‐19
      responses in two settler colonial societies—Australia and the United States—to
      consider how distinct styles of pandemic responses in each context resonate and
      dissonate across the racially uneven distribution of futurity that structures
      liberal order. In each case, the event of COVID‐19 has indeed opened a window
      that reveals multiple slow emergencies; yet in these and other responses this
      revelation is not leading to meaningful changes to address underlying forms of
      structural violence. In Australia and the United States, we see how specific slow
      emergencies—human‐induced climate change and anti‐Black violence in White
      supremacist societies, respectively—become intensified as liberal order
      recalibrates itself in response to the event of COVID‐19.

TI  - Populist politics of representation and foreign policy: evidence from Poland.
PG  - 1-19
AB  - This article characterizes and analyses variations in Poland’s foreign policy
      under the Law and Justice (PiS) government with a view to shed light on the
      distinctive influence of populism. I argue that this influence has mainly to do
      with the ‘politics of representation’, understood both in the sense of meaning
      production and of theatrical performance. Building on the discursive and
      stylistic approaches to populism as well as on the post-structuralist literature 
      in Foreign Policy Analysis, this article conceptualizes populism as a set of
      representational practices in domestic politics that spill over, and affect,
      foreign policy. By promoting distinct representations of Self and Other in
      international affairs and by investing foreign policy making as a site to perform
      a rupture with technocratic elites, populist practices contribute to enable or
      constrain certain policy choices and mode of diplomatic actions. In Poland, this 
      has translated into a securitization of the EU, a partial de-Europeanization of
      the national interest and a re-shuffling of partnership prioritizations, as well 
      as in disruptive and ‘undiplomatic’ comments on the part of the PiS foreign
      policy executive.

TI  - Building the evidence base for global health policy: the need to strengthen
      institutional networks, geographical representation and global collaboration.
LID - e006852
AB  - National public health institutes and WHO collaborating centres, and their global
      networks, are a key resource to support public health system strengthening with
      essential public health functions and generate evidence for health policy central
      to national health and socioeconomic development. The COVID-19 pandemic has laid 
      bare global inequities in public health capacities, made urgent the need to
      examine sources of global knowledge and understand how to better invest in and
      use public health institutes and their capacities. This analysis paper
      incorporates experiences and perspectives from the WHO and International
      Association of National Public Health Institutes including the ongoing pandemic
      and work conducted in the UK-WHO ‘Tackling Deadly Diseases in Africa Programme’. 
      We acknowledge geographical disparities in public health capacities both within
      and across countries and regions, provide examples of novel ways of working for
      global health actors, and define the challenging environment in which public
      health authorities operate. We identify four incentives for all countries to
      invest in public health and strengthen institutions: (1) transparency and trust; 
      (2) socioeconomic dividends; (3) collective health protection and (4) knowledge
      sharing and equity. By pursuing shared priorities; enabling voices from
      low-resource settings to be more equitably heard; facilitating collaboration and 
      learning within and across regions, we articulate actionable next steps to
      develop and better harness public health institutes and international networks.

TI  - The Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on ICU Healthcare Professionals: A Mixed
      Methods Study.
LID - 9243
AB  - The large numbers of patients admitted to intensive care units due to COVID-19
      has had a major impact on healthcare professionals. The incidence of mental
      health disorders among these professionals has increased considerably and their
      professional quality of life has suffered during the pandemic. This study aims to
      explore the impact of the provision of COVID-19 patient care on ICU healthcare
      professionals. A mixed methods study with an exploratory concurrent design was
      conducted between June and November 2020 in the Balearic Islands, Spain. Data
      were collected using a self-report online survey (n = 122) based on three
      validated questionnaires, and individual semi-structured in-depth online
      interviews (n = 11). Respondents scored 2.5 out of 5 on the moral distress scale,
      moderate/high on the compassion satisfaction scale, and moderate on the burnout
      and compassion fatigue subscales. Age was significantly and negatively related to
      professional quality of life but was positively related to workload and
      unavailability of protective equipment. Three main groups of themes relating to
      the impact of the pandemic emerged from the in-depth interviews: (a) clinical,
      (b) professional, and (c) personal and family impacts in the two waves. ICU
      healthcare professionals should be viewed as second victims of the COVID-19
      pandemic as they have suffered significant psychological, professional, and moral
      harm.

TI  - Genome-resolved metagenomics using environmental and clinical samples.
LID - bbab030
AB  - Recent advances in high-throughput sequencing technologies and computational
      methods have added a new dimension to metagenomic data analysis i.e.
      genome-resolved metagenomics. In general terms, it refers to the recovery of
      draft or high-quality microbial genomes and their taxonomic classification and
      functional annotation. In recent years, several studies have utilized the
      genome-resolved metagenome analysis approach and identified previously unknown
      microbial species from human and environmental metagenomes. In this review, we
      describe genome-resolved metagenome analysis as a series of four necessary steps:
      (i) preprocessing of the sequencing reads, (ii) de novo metagenome assembly,
      (iii) genome binning and (iv) taxonomic and functional analysis of the recovered 
      genomes. For each of these four steps, we discuss the most commonly used tools
      and the currently available pipelines to guide the scientific community in the
      recovery and subsequent analyses of genomes from any metagenome sample.
      Furthermore, we also discuss the tools required for validation of assembly
      quality as well as for improving quality of the recovered genomes. We also
      highlight the currently available pipelines that can be used to automate the
      whole analysis without having advanced bioinformatics knowledge. Finally, we will
      highlight the most widely adapted and actively maintained tools and pipelines
      that can be helpful to the scientific community in decision making before they
      commence the analysis.

TI  - Organising knowledge to prevent global health crises: a comparative analysis of
      pandemic preparedness indicators.
LID - e006864
AB  - Preparing for the possibility of a global pandemic presents a transnational
      organisational challenge: to assemble and coordinate knowledge over
      institutionally diverse countries with high fidelity. The COVID-19 pandemic has
      laid these problems bare. This article examines the construction of the three
      main cross-national indicators of pandemic preparedness: a database with
      self-reported data by governments, external evaluations organised by the WHO and 
      a global ranking known as the Global Health Security Index. Each of these
      presents a different model of collecting evidence and organising knowledge: the
      collation of self-reports by national authorities; the coordination of evaluation
      by an epistemic community authorised by an intergovernmental organisation and on 
      the basis of a strict template; and the cobbling together of different sources
      into a common indicator by a transnational multi-stakeholder initiative. We posit
      that these models represent different ways of creating knowledge to inform policy
      choices, and each has different forms of potential bias. In turn, this shapes how
      policymakers understand what is ‘best practice’ and appropriate policy in
      pandemic preparedness.

TI  - Financialisation of schooling in Australia through private debt: a case study of 
      Edstart.
PG  - 1-17
AB  - In Australia, a range of financial services, including education bonds, high
      interest personal loans and credit card debt, have long been used to help
      families pay for the cost of schooling. However, innovative financial technology 
      (fintech) solutions are emerging which align with the growth of a lower risk ‘buy
      now, pay later’ phenomenon. Fintechs claim to expand financial inclusion to more 
      people, particularly when their lending activities are compared to traditional
      banking services. This paper focuses on Edstart, a fintech edu-business that
      provides low-risk lending for families managing the cost of school fees. In
      conducting qualitative content analysis of Edstart’s website and blog, I
      catalogue its market-making activities and how it is leveraging logics of school 
      choice to create a new education service market in Australia that normalises
      school privatisation and the payment of school fees. I end this paper with a
      discussion of how school choice—as a key policy reform of governments—is
      associated with the rollback of the welfare state and increased levels of
      individual financialisation. I argue that parent consumers have become
      increasingly invested in choosing the ‘best’ school for their children, and that 
      this often increases their level of private debt.

TI  - Forum: Did “America First” Construct America Irrelevant?
LID - ekab013
AB  - Did “America First” construct America irrelevant? Answering this question has
      been the subject of much debate in the popular press, the policy community, and
      scholarly circles. That asked, it is worth remembering that scholars and
      policymakers have long argued that one of the most enduring and important aspects
      of the US role in the world is American structural power. Perhaps nowhere has the
      Trump administration's approach to world affairs been more notable in perhaps
      diminishing US structural power than in withdrawing from multilateral forums. On 
      an individual level of analysis, however, Trump's ever-changing, whiplash style
      of leadership made allies and adversaries less certain about American actions,
      intentions, and the direction of future policy trajectories. These issues point
      to the possibility that such impacts were more about Trump being Trump and less
      about a decline in American structural power. Only time will tell whether
      President Biden is able to rebuild from that structural wreckage. With these
      ideas in mind, the forum editors asked scholars representing diverse voices and
      perspectives to provide varying analyses of America First, specifically in light 
      of the emergence of multiple global challenges from the COVID-19 pandemic to
      racial reckoning through the climate crisis and more. As you will see, each
      author brings a decidedly different lens to the questions we pose below and also 
      generates divergent analyses of the present and the future.

TI  - Association between Polymorphism rs1799732 of DRD2 Dopamine Receptor Gene and
      Personality Traits among MMA Athletes.
LID - 1217
AB  - Four factors—namely, harm avoidance, novelty seeking, reward addiction and
      persistence—represent the nature of temperament that is not genetically
      determined in itself. It was shown in earlier studies that a strong propensity to
      look for novelty or a tendency to engage in risky behavior is correlated with
      genetic variants in the area of the genes encoding dopamine receptors. Therefore,
      the aim of this study is to determine whether there is a relationship between
      personality traits and genetic variants in the area of the DRD2 dopamine receptor
      gene in MMA athletes. The participants consisted of 85 mixed martial arts (MMA)
      athletes and 284 healthy, non-MMA male participants. Their personality traits
      were measured using the Revised Temperament and Character Inventory. Blood was
      collected for genetic assays and all samples were genotyped using the real-time
      PCR method. We observed a statistically significant effect of a complex factor of
      the DRD2 rs1799732 genotype on MMA participants’ control and reward dependence.
      Engaging in high-risk sport may be associated with several personality
      characteristics. The DRD2 rs1799732 polymorphism may be associated with reduced
      harm avoidance in martial arts athletes, thereby modulating athletes’
      predisposition to participate in high-risk sport.

TI  - The Daily Mile in practice: implementation and adaptation of the school running
      programme in a multiethnic city in the UK.
LID - e046655
AB  - Objectives: The aim of this study was to generate new evidence on how The Daily
      Mile (TDM), a popular school-based running programme in the UK, is implemented in
      a diverse and multiethnic city in the UK and also the barriers faced by
      non-implementer schools. Design: Mixed method cross-sectional study (including
      survey data collection and qualitative interviews). Setting: Primary schools in a
      multiethnic city in the East Midlands, UK. Participants: Forty-two schools in
      Leicester city completed an online survey, and five teaching staff from five
      schools took part in follow-up semistructured qualitative interviews. Results:
      Overall, 40.5% of schools who completed the survey reported having never
      implemented TDM, and 96.0% of implementer schools reported delivering TDM on
      three or more days per week. Reported barriers included space limitations and
      safety issues, timetabling and curriculum pressures, and pupil and teacher
      attitudes. Facilitators of implementation were teacher engagement and school
      culture/ethos, communication of the initiative and substantial delivery
      adaptations. Conclusions: The findings from this study, based on data from
      schools in a multiethnic city in the UK, suggest that implementation of TDM is
      variable, and is influenced by a range of factors related to the school context, 
      as well as the characteristics of TDM itself.

      meta-analysis.
LID - e001094
AB  - Aim: To estimate the incidence of injury in adult elite women’s football and to
      characterise the nature and anatomical location of injuries. Design: Systematic
      review and meta-analysis. Data sources: Combinations of the key terms were
      entered into the following electronic databases (PubMed, SPORTDiscus, Science
      Direct and Discover) from inception to May 2021. Eligibility criteria for
      selecting studies: (1) Used a prospective cohort design; (2) captured data on
      elite adult women players; (3) reported injury incidence by anatomical site; (4) 
      captured data of at least one season or national team tournament; (5) included a 
      definition of injury; and (6) written in English. Results: The search identified 
      1378 records. Twelve studies published between 1991 and 2018 were included in our
      review and sampled 129 teams. In domestic club football, injury incidence rate
      was estimated to be 5.7/1000 hours (total), 19.5/1000 hours (match) and 3.1/1000 
      hours (training). In tournament, football match incidence was estimated to be
      55.7/1000 hours. The knee (22.8%; 368/1822) was the most common site of injury in
      domestic club football. The ankle (23.7%, 105/443) was the most common site of
      injury in tournament football. Ligament sprains were the most common type of
      injury (27.8%), followed by muscle strains (19.1%). Severn studies (58%) had a
      high risk of bias associated with exposure definition and measurement and
      considerable heterogeneity exists between the included studies (I2=49.7%–95%).
      Summary/conclusion: Ligament sprains occur more frequently in adult elite women
      football players. We advise caution in interpretating point estimates of the
      incidence of injury due to high statistical heterogeneity. Standardising injury
      reporting and the accurate recording of match and training exposure will overcome
      such limitations. PROSPERO registration number: CRD42019130407.su

TI  - Beyond the metrics of health research performance in African countries.
LID - e006019
AB  - While it is important to be able to evaluate and measure a country’s performance 
      in health research (HR), HR systems are complex and multifaceted in nature. As
      such, attempts at measurement can suffer several limitations which risk leading
      to inadequate indices or representations. In this study, we critically review
      common indicators of HR capacity and performance and explore their strengths and 
      limitations. The paper is informed by review of data sources and documents,
      combined with interviews and peer-to-peer learning activities conducted with
      officials working in health and education ministries in a set of nine African
      countries. We find that many metrics that can assess HR performance have gaps in 
      the conceptualisation or fail to address local contextual realities, which makes 
      it a challenge to interpret them in relation to other theoretical constructs. Our
      study identified several concepts that are excluded from current definitions of
      indicators and systems of metrics for HR performance. These omissions may be
      particularly important for interpreting HR performance within the context and
      processes of HR in African countries, and thus challenging the relevance,
      utility, appropriateness and acceptability of universal measures of HR in the
      region. We discuss the challenges that scholars may find in conceptualising such 
      a complex phenomenon—including the different and competing viewpoints of
      stakeholders, in setting objectives of HR measurement work, and in navigating the
      realities of empirical measurement where missing or partial data may necessitate 
      that proxies or alternative indicators may be chosen. These findings are
      important to ensure that the global health community does not rely on
      over-simplistic evaluations of HR when analysing and planning for improvements in
      low-income and middle-income countries.

TI  - Defining “elite” status in sport: from chaos to clarity.
PG  - 1-5
AB  - The past two decades have seen a rapid rise in attention towards talent
      identification, athlete development and skill acquisition. However, there are
      important limitations to the evidentiary foundations of this field of research.
      For instance, variability in describing the performance levels of individuals has
      made it challenging to draw inferences about inter- and intrapopulation
      differences. More specifically, recent reviews on high performers in sport have
      noted considerable variation in how terms such as “elite” are used. This may be
      particularly concerning for researchers in high-performance disciplines, since
      they regularly struggle with small sample sizes and rely on research synthesis

TI  - Neural response during temporal – and spatial luminance contrast processing and
      its manifestation in the blood-oxygen-level-dependent-signal in striate and
      extra-striate cortex.
PG  - 994-1000
AB  - The primate visual system has been the prime site for investigating the
      relationship between stimulus property, neural response and
      blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD)-signal; yet this relationship remains
      ill-understood. Electrophysiological studies have shown that the ability to
      visualise a neural response is determined by stimulus property and presentation
      paradigm. The neural response in the human visual cortex consists of a phasic
      response processing temporal and tonic response processing spatial luminance
      contrast. We investigated their influence on the BOLD signal from the visual
      cortex. To do so, we compared BOLD signal amplitude from BA17 and BA18 of 15
      human volunteers to visual patterns varying the size of the active neural
      population and the discharge activity of this population. The BOLD signal
      amplitude in both areas reflected the discharge activity of the active neural
      population but not the size of the active neural population. For identical
      stimuli, BOLD signal amplitude in BA17 exceeded than that of BA18. This indicates
      that the BOLD signal reflects the tonic neural neuronal response during spatial
      luminance contrast processing. The difference in BOLD signal amplitude between
      BA17 and BA18 is accounted for by differences in neurophysiological and
      cytoarchitectonic differences between the two areas. Our findings offer an
      understanding of the relationship between stimulus property, neural response and 
      the BOLD signal by considering the cytoarchitectonic, and neurophysiological
      make-up between different cortical areas and the influence of a phasic and tonic 
      neural response on local deoxyhaemoglobin concentration. Conversely, differences 
      in BOLD signal between brain structures and stimuli provide cues to the influence
      of different neurophysiological mechanisms on the neural response.

TI  - The impact of intra-specific diversity in the rhizobia-legume symbiosis.
LID - 001051
AB  - Rhizobia - nitrogen-fixing, root-nodulating bacteria - play a critical role in
      both plant ecosystems and sustainable agriculture. Rhizobia form intracellular
      infections within legumes roots where they produce plant accessible nitrogen from
      atmospheric nitrogen and thus reduce the reliance on industrial inputs. The
      rhizobia-legume symbiosis is often treated as a pairwise relationship between
      single genotypes, both in research and in the production of rhizobial inoculants.
      However in nature individual plants are infected by a high diversity of rhizobia 
      symbionts. How this diversity affects productivity within the symbiosis is
      unclear. Here, we use a powerful statistical approach to assess the impact of
      diversity within the Rhizobium leguminosarum - clover symbiosis using a
      biodiversity-ecosystem function framework. Statistically, we found no significant
      impact of rhizobium diversity. However this relationship was weakly positive -
      rather than negative - indicating that there is no significant cost to increasing
      inoculant diversity. Productivity was influenced by the identity of the strains
      within an inoculant; strains with the highest individual performance showed a
      significant positive contribution within mixed inoculants. Overall, inoculant
      effectiveness was best predicted by the individual performance of the best
      inoculant member, and only weakly predicted by the worst performing member.
      Collectively, our data suggest that the Rhizobium leguminosarum - clover
      symbiosis displays a weak diversity-function relationship, but that inoculant
      performance can be improved through the inclusion of high performing strains.
      Given the wide environmental dependence of rhizobial inoculant quality,
      multi-strain inoculants could be highly successful as they increase the
      likelihood of including a strain well adapted to local conditions across
      different environments.

TI  - Public engagement with science—Origins, motives and impact in academic literature
      and science policy.
LID - e0254201
AB  - ‘Public engagement with science’ has become a ‘buzzword’ reflecting a concern
      about the widening gap between science and society and efforts to bridge this
      gap. This study is a comprehensive analysis of the development of the
      ‘engagement’ rhetoric in the pertinent academic literature on science
      communication and in science policy documents. By way of a content analysis of
      articles published in three leading science communication journals and a
      selection of science policy documents from the United Kingdom (UK), the United
      States of America (USA), the European Union (EU), and South Africa (SA), the
      variety of motives underlying this rhetoric, as well as the impact it has on
      science policies, are analyzed. The analysis of the science communication
      journals reveals an increasingly vague and inclusive definition of ‘engagement’
      as well as of the ‘public’ being addressed, and a diverse range of motives
      driving the rhetoric. Similar observations can be made about the science policy
      documents. This study corroborates an earlier diagnosis that rhetoric is running 
      ahead of practice and suggests that communication and engagement with clearly
      defined stakeholder groups about specific problems and the pertinent scientific
      knowledge will be a more successful manner of ‘engagement’.

TI  - Gendered Infrastructural Citizenship: Shared Sanitation Facilities in Quarry Road
      West Informal Settlement, Durban, South Africa.
PG  - 1-20
AB  - One significant component of the South African citizenship narrative is centred
      around the right to basic services and corresponding elements, including dignity 
      and a healthy living environment. This paper employs the concept of
      infrastructural citizenship, which draws on both infrastructure and citizenship
      discourses to explore how participants experience and challenge public
      infrastructure and as such engage with questions surrounding citizenship on an
      everyday basis (Lemanski, 2019a). Adopting a gendered approach, this paper draws 
      on the empirical case of Quarry Road West, an informal settlement located in
      Durban, and uses a qualitative methodology. Residents have access to Community
      Ablution Blocks, free shared sanitation facilities provided by the eThekwini
      Municipality. This paper argues that restricted access to the facilities
      undermines perceptions of privacy and health and negatively impacts women
      individually and in the community. Furthermore, this paper evaluates civic
      responses to inadequate infrastructure in the form of participation, protest and 
      state-directed actions. As such, it examines how women-state relationships are
      embedded in public infrastructure, and limitations in regards to infrastructure
      shape interactions and engagements with the state, their experiences of
      citizenship, actualisation of rights and identities.

TI  - Capitalising on chaos – exploring the impact and future of social media
      influencer engagement during the early stages of a global pandemic.
PG  - 106-13
AB  - This article examines the role of influencers during the early stages of the
      COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the impact of the global pandemic on Social Media
      Influencers’ (SMIs) lifestyle and business model, using the concept of Disaster
      Capitalism as a springboard for discussion. Worldwide it first appeared that the 
      global pandemic would severely impact SMI sole traders, as income from travel,
      luxury goods and other ‘lifestyle’ brands dried up. However, we suggest that
      brands and influencers themselves have pivoted to meet the COVID challenge, with 
      some brands exploiting the opaque influence of these micro-celebrities. We
      further suggest that while a handful of governments and health organisations have
      recognised the reach and social capital of SMIs, their potential in health
      communication has been underutilised. We write this essay as a starting point,
      raising questions and calling for further research to be conducted to inform the 
      understanding of SMIs’ role and potential as conveyors of public health
      information.

      data.
PG  - 766-75
AB  - Background: People with lived‐experience of the phenomenon under investigation
      are seldom involved in the analysis of qualitative data, and there exists little 
      guidance for those wishing to involve contributors at this stage of research.
      Aims: To critically reflect on the process of involving people with
      lived‐experience in a thematic analysis and to offer direction to other
      researchers. Methods: An individual with lived‐experience of residing in prison
      contributed to a co‐analysis of qualitative data using thematic analysis. This
      paper reports on involvement at each stage of a thematic analysis and follows an 
      established reporting checklist. Results: A number of challenges and benefits
      were encountered in the process of co‐analysing the data. These are discussed in 
      relation to previous research and how to overcome the challenges encountered.
      Conclusions: The paper concludes by giving recommendations and guidance for
      future researchers wishing to involve people with lived‐experience in qualitative
      data analysis.

TI  - Resequencing of 672 Native Rice Accessions to Explore Genetic Diversity and Trait
      Associations in Vietnam.
LID - 52
AB  - Background: Vietnam possesses a vast diversity of rice landraces due to its
      geographical situation, latitudinal range, and a variety of ecosystems. This
      genetic diversity constitutes a highly valuable resource at a time when the
      highest rice production areas in the low-lying Mekong and Red River Deltas are
      enduring increasing threats from climate changes, particularly in rainfall and
      temperature patterns. Results: We analysed 672 Vietnamese rice genomes, 616 newly
      sequenced, that encompass the range of rice varieties grown in the diverse
      ecosystems found throughout Vietnam. We described four Japonica and five Indica
      subpopulations within Vietnam likely adapted to the region of origin. We compared
      the population structure and genetic diversity of these Vietnamese rice genomes
      to the 3000 genomes of Asian cultivated rice. The named Indica-5 (I5)
      subpopulation was expanded in Vietnam and contained lowland Indica accessions,
      which had very low shared ancestry with accessions from any other subpopulation
      and were previously overlooked as admixtures. We scored phenotypic measurements
      for nineteen traits and identified 453 unique genotype-phenotype significant
      associations comprising twenty-one QTLs (quantitative trait loci). The strongest 
      associations were observed for grain size traits, while weaker associations were 
      observed for a range of characteristics, including panicle length, heading date
      and leaf width. Conclusions: We showed how the rice diversity within Vietnam
      relates to the wider Asian rice diversity by using a number of approaches to
      provide a clear picture of the novel diversity present within Vietnam, mainly
      around the Indica-5 subpopulation. Our results highlight differences in genome
      composition and trait associations among traditional Vietnamese rice accessions, 
      which are likely the product of adaption to multiple environmental conditions and
      regional preferences in a very diverse country. Our results highlighted traits
      and their associated genomic regions that are a potential source of novel loci
      and alleles to breed a new generation of low input sustainable and climate
      resilient rice. Supplementary Information: The online version contains

TI  - Advances in Cereal Crop Genomics for Resilience under Climate Change.
LID - 502
AB  - Adapting to climate change, providing sufficient human food and nutritional
      needs, and securing sufficient energy supplies will call for a radical
      transformation from the current conventional adaptation approaches to more
      broad-based and transformative alternatives. This entails diversifying the
      agricultural system and boosting productivity of major cereal crops through
      development of climate-resilient cultivars that can sustainably maintain higher
      yields under climate change conditions, expanding our focus to crop wild
      relatives, and better exploitation of underutilized crop species. This is
      facilitated by the recent developments in plant genomics, such as advances in
      genome sequencing, assembly, and annotation, as well as gene editing
      technologies, which have increased the availability of high-quality reference
      genomes for various model and non-model plant species. This has necessitated
      genomics-assisted breeding of crops, including underutilized species,
      consequently broadening genetic variation of the available germplasm; improving
      the discovery of novel alleles controlling important agronomic traits; and
      enhancing creation of new crop cultivars with improved tolerance to biotic and
      abiotic stresses and superior nutritive quality. Here, therefore, we summarize
      these recent developments in plant genomics and their application, with
      particular reference to cereal crops (including underutilized species).
      Particularly, we discuss genome sequencing approaches, quantitative trait loci
      (QTL) mapping and genome-wide association (GWAS) studies, directed mutagenesis,
      plant non-coding RNAs, precise gene editing technologies such as CRISPR-Cas9, and
      complementation of crop genotyping by crop phenotyping. We then conclude by
      providing an outlook that, as we step into the future, high-throughput
      phenotyping, pan-genomics, transposable elements analysis, and machine learning
      hold much promise for crop improvements related to climate resilience and
      nutritional superiority.

TI  - Seeing the workers for the trees: exalted and devalued manual labour in the
      Pacific Northwest craft cider industry.
PG  - 1-14
AB  - Craft food and beverage makers regularly emphasize transparency about the
      ethical, sustainable sourcing of their ingredients and the human labour
      underpinning their production, all of which helps elevate the status of their
      products and occupational communities. Yet, as with other niche ethical
      consumption markets, craft industries continue to rely on employment conditions
      for agricultural workers that reproduce inequalities of race, class, and
      citizenship in the dominant food system. This paper interrogates the
      contradiction between the exaltation of craft cidermakers’ labour and the
      devaluation of farmworker labour by assessing how craft beverage actors make
      sense of inequalities facing manually skilled agricultural workers. Through a
      focus on the emerging craft cider industry, this paper draws on in-depth
      interviews and ethnographic data with a range of urban and rural cider actors in 
      the Pacific Northwest (British Columbia, Oregon, and Washington State). I find
      that actors in the craft cider industry engage with inequalities affecting
      farmworkers through three main patterns: (1) Justifications of the status quo;
      (2) Supply chain fog; and (3) Misgiving/critique. By using an analytical
      framework that integrates critical agrarianism and the politics of sight, this
      study provides insights into both barriers and opportunities to redistribute
      social recognition and material rewards across food supply chains.

TI  - Motivating antibiotic stewardship in Bangladesh: identifying audiences and target
      behaviours using the behaviour change wheel.
LID - 968
AB  - Background: South Asia is a hotspot for antimicrobial resistance due largely to
      over-the-counter antibiotic sales for humans and animals and from a lack of
      policy compliance among healthcare providers. Additionally, there is high
      population density and high infectious disease burden. This paper describes the
      development of social and behavioural change communication (SBCC) to increase the
      appropriate use of antibiotics. Methods: We used formative research to explore
      contextual drivers of antibiotic sales, purchase, consumption/use and promotion
      among four groups: 1) households, 2) drug shop staff, 3) registered physicians
      and 4) pharmaceutical companies/medical sales representatives. We used formative 
      research findings and an intervention design workshop with stakeholders to select
      target behaviours, prioritise audiences and develop SBCC messages, in
      consultation with a creative agency, and through pilots and feedback. The
      behaviour change wheel was used to summarise findings. Results: Workshop
      participants identified behaviours considered amenable to change for all four
      groups. Household members and drug shop staff were prioritised as target
      audiences, both of which could be reached at drug shops. Among household members,
      there were two behaviours to change: suboptimal health seeking and ceasing
      antibiotic courses early. Thus, SBCC target behaviours included: seek registered 
      physician consultations; ask whether the medicine provided is an antibiotic; ask 
      for instructions on use and timing. Among drug shop staff, important antibiotic
      dispensing practices needed to change. SBCC target behaviours included: asking
      customers for prescriptions, referring them to registered physicians and
      increasing customer awareness by instructing that they were receiving antibiotics
      to take as a full course. Conclusions: We prioritised drug shops for intervention
      delivery to all drug shop staff and their customers to improve antibiotic
      stewardship. Knowledge deficits among these groups were notable and considered
      amenable to change using a SBCC intervention addressing improved health seeking
      behaviours, improved health literacy on antibiotic use, and provision of
      information on policy governing shops. Further intervention refinement should
      consider using participatory methods and address the impact on profit and
      livelihoods for drug shop staff for optimal compliance.

TI  - The Application of ‘Elite Interviewing’ Methodology in Transdisciplinary
      Research: a Record of Process and Lessons Learned during a 3-Year Pilot in Urban 
      Planetary Health Research.
PG  - 404-14
AB  - This paper sets out the rationale and process for the interviewing methodology
      utilized during a 3-year research pilot, ‘Moving Health Upstream in Urban
      Development’ (UPSTREAM). The project had two primary aims: firstly, to attempt to
      value economically the health cost benefits associated with the quality of urban 
      environments and secondly, to engage with those in control of urban development
      in the UK in order to determine what are the barriers to and opportunities for
      creating healthy urban environments, including those identified through the
      utilisation of economic valuation. Engagement at senior level with those who have
      most control over key facets of planning and development implementation—such as
      land disposal, investment, development delivery and planning permission—was
      central to the approach, which encompassed the adoption of ‘elite interviewing’, 
      a method developed in the USA in the 1950s and used in the political sciences but
      relatively unutilized in the health and environmental sciences [1]. Two rounds of
      semi-structured interviews were undertaken with 15 senior decision-makers from
      the UK’s main urban development delivery agencies, both public and private. The
      ‘elite interviewing’ approach successfully enabled the UPSTREAM project to
      capture and analyse the information received from the interviewees, all of whom
      held influential or leadership posts in organisations that are important actors
      in the process of planning, developing and constructing the built environment in 
      the UK. Having academic and practitioner research leads on an equal footing
      created some minor tensions, but it also appeared to strengthen the rigor of the 
      approach through a broad knowledge of context ‘in-house’. This form of
      co-production at times challenged academic traditions in qualitative analysis,
      but it also appeared to build trust with interviewees and provided greater
      clarity of the real-world context under investigation. Findings from this study
      are written up in a separate paper.

TI  - Differential rotational movement and symmetry values of the thoracolumbosacral
      region in high-level dressage horses when trotting.
LID - e0251144
AB  - High-level dressage horses regularly perform advanced movements, requiring
      coordination and force transmission between front and hind limbs across the
      thoracolumbosacral region. This study aimed at quantifying kinematic differences 
      in dressage horses when ridden in sitting trot–i.e. with additional load applied 
      in the thoracolumbar region–compared with trotting in-hand. Inertial sensors were
      glued on to the midline of the thoracic (T) and lumbar (L) spine at T5, T13, T18,
      L3 and middle of the left and right tubera sacrale of ten elite dressage horses
      (Mean±SD), age 11±1 years, height 1.70±0.10m and body mass 600±24kg; first
      trotted in-hand, then ridden in sitting trot on an arena surface by four Grand
      Prix dressage riders. Straight-line motion cycles were analysed using a general
      linear model (random factor: horse; fixed factor: exercise condition; covariate: 
      stride time, Bonferroni post hoc correction: P<0.05). Differential roll, pitch
      and yaw angles between adjacent sensors were calculated. In sitting trot,
      compared to trotting in-hand, there was increased pitch (mean±S.D), (in-hand, 3.9
      (0.5°, sitting trot 6.3 (0.3°, P = <0.0001), roll (in-hand, 7.7 (1.1°, sitting
      trot 11.6 (0.9°, P = 0.003) and heading values (in-hand, 4.2 (0.8), sitting trot 
      9.5 (0.6°, P = <0.0001) in the caudal thoracic and lumbar region (T18-L3) and a
      decrease in heading values (in-hand, 7.1 (0.5°, sitting trot 5.2 (0.3°, P = 0.01)
      in the cranial thoracic region (T5-T13). Kinematics of the caudal thoracic and
      lumbar spine are influenced by the rider when in sitting trot, whilst lateral
      bending is reduced in the cranial thoracic region. This biomechanical difference 
      with the addition of a rider, emphasises the importance of observing horses
      during ridden exercise, when assessing them as part of a loss of performance
      assessment.

TI  - The role of professional elites in healthcare governance: Exploring the work of
      the medical director.
LID - 113882
AB  - Medical leaders occupy a prominent position in healthcare policy in many
      countries, both in terms of the governance of quality and safety within
      healthcare organisations, and in broader system-wide governance. There is
      evidence that having doctors on hospital boards is associated with higher quality
      services. What is not known is how they have this effect. Analysing data
      collected from observations, interviews and documents from 15 healthcare
      providers in England (2014–2019), we elaborate the role of medical directors in
      healthcare governance as ‘translation work’, ‘diplomatic work’, and ‘repair
      work’. Our study highlights the often enduring emotional effects of repeated
      structural changes to clinical services. It also contributes to theories of
      professional restratification, showing the work of medical directors as regional 
      ‘political elites’, and as ‘corporate elites’ in publicly-funded healthcare
      systems.

PG  - 1-35
AB  - This research focuses on a sample of European and Chinese elite universities for 
      the period 2011–2015. We adopt a meta-frontier methodology to decompose their
      overall productivity in three main determinants: (1) technical efficiency
      compared with contemporaneous technology, (2) change in technical efficiency and 
      (3) technology relative superiority of the two groups of universities. The
      results reveal different patterns of evolution: Chinese institutions’
      productivity grows faster than that of their European counterparts (+ 7.15%/year 
      vs 4.51%/year), however the latter maintain a higher level of technology in
      efficient production as a group.

TI  - The cis-regulatory effects of modern human-specific variants.
LID - e63713
AB  - The Neanderthal and Denisovan genomes enabled the discovery of sequences that
      differ between modern and archaic humans, the majority of which are noncoding.
      However, our understanding of the regulatory consequences of these differences
      remains limited, in part due to the decay of regulatory marks in ancient samples.
      Here, we used a massively parallel reporter assay in embryonic stem cells, neural
      progenitor cells, and bone osteoblasts to investigate the regulatory effects of
      the 14,042 single-nucleotide modern human-specific variants. Overall, 1791 (13%) 
      of sequences containing these variants showed active regulatory activity, and 407
      (23%) of these drove differential expression between human groups. Differentially
      active sequences were associated with divergent transcription factor binding
      motifs, and with genes enriched for vocal tract and brain anatomy and function.
      This work provides insight into the regulatory function of variants that emerged 
      along the modern human lineage and the recent evolution of human gene expression.

TI  - The virtual physiological human gets nerves! How to account for the action of the
      nervous system in multiphysics simulations of human organs.
LID - 20201024
AB  - This article shows how to couple multiphysics and artificial neural networks to
      design computer models of human organs that autonomously adapt their behaviour to
      environmental stimuli. The model simulates motility in the intestine and adjusts 
      its contraction patterns to the physical properties of the luminal content.
      Multiphysics reproduces the solid mechanics of the intestinal membrane and the
      fluid mechanics of the luminal content; the artificial neural network replicates 
      the activity of the enteric nervous system. Previous studies recommended training
      the network with reinforcement learning. Here, we show that reinforcement
      learning alone is not enough; the input–output structure of the network should
      also mimic the basic circuit of the enteric nervous system. Simulations are
      validated against in vivo measurements of high-amplitude propagating contractions
      in the human intestine. When the network has the same input–output structure of
      the nervous system, the model performs well even when faced with conditions
      outside its training range. The model is trained to optimize transport, but it
      also keeps stress in the membrane low, which is exactly what occurs in the real
      intestine. Moreover, the model responds to atypical variations of its functioning
      with ‘symptoms’ that reflect those arising in diseases. If the healthy intestine 
      model is made artificially ill by adding digital inflammation, motility patterns 
      are disrupted in a way consistent with inflammatory pathologies such as
      inflammatory bowel disease.

TI  - Discovering latent node Information by graph attention network.
LID - 6967
AB  - In this paper, we propose graph attention based network representation (GANR)
      which utilizes the graph attention architecture and takes graph structure as the 
      supervised learning information. Compared with node classification based
      representations, GANR can be used to learn representation for any given graph.
      GANR is not only capable of learning high quality node representations that
      achieve a competitive performance on link prediction, network visualization and
      node classification but it can also extract meaningful attention weights that can
      be applied in node centrality measuring task. GANR can identify the leading
      venture capital investors, discover highly cited papers and find the most
      influential nodes in Susceptible Infected Recovered Model. We conclude that link 
      structures in graphs are not limited on predicting linkage itself, it is capable 
      of revealing latent node information in an unsupervised way once a appropriate
      learning algorithm, like GANR, is provided.

TI  - Predicting the Patriarchal Politics of Pandemics From Mary Shelley to COVID-19.
LID - 624909
AB  - I examine the predictive powers of the political science fictions of Mary
      Shelley, Octavia Butler, and Margaret Atwood for understanding the patriarchal—or
      men-dominant—dynamics of the politics of pandemics in the twenty-first century.
      Like her literary followers in post-apocalyptic plague literature, Butler and
      Atwood, Shelley foresaw that the twenty-first century would be the age of lethal 
      pandemics. Their post-apocalyptic fictions also projected the ways that
      patriarchal and authoritarian forms of populism could shape the cultural
      circumstances that can turn a local outbreak of a new and deadly contagious
      disease, like COVID-19, into a politically chaotic and economically devastating
      global plague. Modern feminist political science fiction born of Shelley's great 
      pandemic novel The Last Man (1826) is seemingly clairvoyant not because of any
      supernatural powers of the authors but rather because of their studied attention 
      to the wisdom of plague literature, the lessons of epidemic history, and the
      political dynamics of patriarchy and populism.

TI  - Loops and Building Blocks: a Knowledge co-Production Framework for Equitable
      Urban Health.
PG  - 394-403
AB  - This paper sets out a structured process for the co-production of knowledge
      between researchers and societal partners and illustrates its application in an
      urban health equity project in Accra, Ghana. The main insight of this approach is
      that research and knowledge co-production is always partial, both in the sense of
      being incomplete, as well as being circumscribed by the interests of
      participating researchers and societal partners. A second insight is that
      project-bound societal engagement takes place in a broader context of public and 
      policy debate. The approach to co-production described here is formed of three
      recursive processes: co-designing, co-analysing, and co-creating knowledge. These
      ‘co-production loops’ are themselves iterative, each representing a stage of
      knowledge production. Each loop is operationalized through a series of research
      and engagement practices, which we call building blocks. Building blocks are
      activities and interaction-based methods aimed at bringing together a range of
      participants involved in joint knowledge production. In practice, recursive
      iterations within loops may be limited due of constraints on time, resources, or 
      attention. We suggest that co-production loops and building blocks are deployed
      flexibly.

PG  - 3-8
AB  - The peer review process is essential for quality checks and validation of journal
      submissions. Although it has some limitations, including manipulations and biased
      and unfair evaluations, there is no other alternative to the system. Several peer
      review models are now practised, with public review being the most appropriate in
      view of the open science movement. Constructive reviewer comments are
      increasingly recognised as scholarly contributions which should meet certain
      ethics and reporting standards. The Publons platform, which is now part of the
      Web of Science Group (Clarivate Analytics), credits validated reviewer
      accomplishments and serves as an instrument for selecting and promoting the best 
      reviewers. All authors with relevant profiles may act as reviewers. Adherence to 
      research reporting standards and access to bibliographic databases are
      recommended to help reviewers draft evidence-based and detailed comments.

TI  - Prognostic value of PD-L1 expression in bronchopulmonary neuroendocrine tumours.
PG  - 180-90
AB  - Programmed death protein 1 (PD-1) and its ligand, PD-L1, have emerged as
      promising therapeutic targets for many types of cancer that overexpress PD-L1.
      However, data on PD-L1 expression levels in bronchopulmonary neuroendocrine
      neoplasms (BP-NEN) are limited and contradictory. In the present study, a total
      of 298 archived, formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded BP-NEN samples from 97
      patients diagnosed with typical carcinoid (TC), atypical carcinoid (AC), small
      cell lung cancer (SCLC), or large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma of the lung
      (LCNEC) were evaluated for PD-L1 expression by immunohistochemistry using the
      highly sensitive monoclonal anti-PD-L1 antibody 73-10. PD-L1 expression levels
      were semiquantitatively estimated by tumour grading. Of the 298 BP-NEN samples,
      85% were positive for PD-L1 expression. PD-L1 immunostaining predominantly
      localized to the plasma membrane of both tumour cells and tumour-infiltrating
      immune cells. SCLC and LCNEC exhibited significantly higher PD-L1 expression
      levels than TC or AC. PD-L1 expression levels were also higher in patients with
      lymph node or distant metastases, in patients who smoked, and in patients who
      died during the follow-up period. Moreover, PD-L1 expression levels correlated
      positively with tumour grading, Ki-67 index and the expression of the chemokine
      receptor CXCR4 and negatively with the levels of somatostatin receptor 1 and
      chromogranin A. High tumour PD-L1 levels were associated with poor patient
      outcomes. In conclusion, PD-L1 expression is common in BP-NEN, increases with
      malignancy, and is associated with poor prognosis. Therefore, targeting the
      PD-1/PD-L1 axis could be a promising strategy for treating BP-NEN. PD-L1 may also
      represent a useful prognostic biomarker for this tumour entity.

TI  - Lumbosacral injuries in elite Paralympic athletes with limb deficiency: a
      retrospective analysis of patient records.
LID - e001001
AB  - Background: Compared to injury data in able-bodied athletes, relatively little
      literature exists for Paralympic athletes. Injury data underpins the design and
      evaluation of injury prevention strategies in elite sport. The aim of this study 
      was to investigate frequency, characteristics and management of lumbosacral
      injuries in elite athletes with limb deficiency. Methods: A retrospective
      analysis of injuries in elite athletes with limb deficiency (2008 to 2017) was
      conducted using available data extracted from The English Institute of Sport
      (EIS) clinical records. Eligibility criteria: funded athletes, eligible for EIS
      physiotherapy support with full or partial limb deficiency. Data were analysed
      descriptively using frequencies. Results: A total of 107 injuries from 32
      athletes were included. Participants comprised 18 men (59%), from 9 sports, with 
      mean age for index injuries of 27 years (range 18 to 38 years) and 15 with
      congenital limb deficiency (47%). Average number of index injuries for congenital
      and traumatic limb deficient groups were 13 and 19, respectively. Where injury
      onset was recorded (n=79), half of injuries occurred during training (40%, n=43).
      Arthrogenic structures accounted for 32.7% of injuries, myogenic 26.2%, with
      neurogenic, discogenic and osteogenic each <5%. The number of treatments
      delivered in each injury episode ranged from 1 to 43, with symptom resolution
      taking 2 to 439 days. Conclusion: Elite athletes with limb deficiency experience 
      lumbosacral injuries predominantly involving muscles and joints. While
      consistency and accuracy of data recording limits definitive conclusions,
      findings highlight the importance of precision in recording injury data as part
      of surveillance to enable implementation of effective injury prevention
      strategies.

TI  - Re-visioning Ideological Assemblages Through De-punctualizing and Activist
      Science, Mathematics and Technology Education.
PG  - 1-14
AB  - It seems clear to many analysts that there are several existential and many
      ‘normalized’ threats to wellbeing of individuals, societies and environments—such
      as disruption from climate change, diseases from manufactured foods and species
      losses linked to habitat destruction—that have been associated with fields of
      science, mathematics and technology (and, likely, engineering). Culpability for
      such threats, while perhaps engaging much of humanity, seems most likely
      attributable to pro-capitalist individuals (e.g., financiers) and groups (e.g.,
      corporations and transnational trade organizations)—which appear to have
      relatively successfully influenced most living and nonliving entities to form
      assemblages (dispositifs) that serve their self-interested ideologies. Given
      harms associated with such assemblages, it seems clear to many analysts that they
      need to be severely disrupted or, perhaps, replaced with alliances of entities
      that are based on ideological perspectives that may contribute to comprehensive
      wellbeing. Although pro-capitalist assemblages have been extremely resilient, it 
      seems that current sociopolitical instability and, moreover, considerable
      disruption from the CoViD-19 pandemic may provide unprecedented opportunities for
      dramatic changes. In this article, after consideration of characteristics and
      extents of harms linked to fields of science, mathematics and
      technology/engineering, possibilities are described and critically defended for
      uses of a particular curriculum and pedagogical framework for helping students to
      imagine and, perhaps, realize new assemblages of entities that are held together 
      by ideologies that they consider appropriate.

      perennial crops and its improvement has been the focus of human effort for
      thousands of years. Here, we genetically characterise over 1000 apple accessions 
      from the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) germplasm collection
      using over 30,000 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). We confirm the close
      genetic relationship between modern apple cultivars and their primary progenitor 
      species, Malus sieversii from Central Asia, and find that cider apples derive
      more of their ancestry from the European crabapple, Malus sylvestris, than do
      dessert apples. We determine that most of the USDA collection is a large complex 
      pedigree: over half of the collection is interconnected by a series of
      first-degree relationships. In addition, 15% of the accessions have a
      first-degree relationship with one of the top 8 cultivars produced in the USA.
      With the exception of ‘Honeycrisp’, the top 8 cultivars are interconnected to
      each other via pedigree relationships. The cultivars ‘Golden Delicious’ and ‘Red 
      Delicious’ were found to have over 60 first-degree relatives, consistent with
      their repeated use by apple breeders. We detected a signature of intense
      selection for red skin and provide evidence that breeders also selected for
      increased firmness. Our results suggest that Americans are eating apples largely 
      from a single family tree and that the apple’s future improvement will benefit
      from increased exploitation of its tremendous natural genetic diversity.

      ants.
LID - e61298
AB  - Ants use debris as tools to collect and transport liquid food to the nest.
      Previous studies showed that this behaviour is flexible whereby ants learn to use
      artificial material that is novel to them and select tools with optimal soaking
      properties. However, the process of tool use has not been studied at the
      individual level. We investigated whether workers specialise in tool use and
      whether there is a link between individual personality traits and tool use in the
      ant Aphaenogaster senilis. Only a small number of workers performed tool use and 
      they did it repeatedly, although they also collected solid food. Personality
      predicted the probability to perform tool use: ants that showed higher
      exploratory activity and were more attracted to a prey in the personality tests
      became the new tool users when previous tool users were removed from the group.
      This suggests that, instead of extreme task specialisation, variation in
      personality traits within the colony may improve division of labour.

TI  - Making sense of professional enablers’ involvement in laundering organized crime 
      proceeds and of their regulation.
PG  - 1-15
AB  - Money laundering has ascended the enforcement and criminological agenda in the
      course of this century, and has been accompanied by an increased focus on legal
      professionals as ‘enablers’ of crime. This article explores the dynamics of this 
      enforcement, media and political agenda, and how the legal profession has
      responded in the UK and elsewhere, within the context of ignoring the
      difficulties of judging the effectiveness of anti money laundering. It concludes 
      that legal responses are a function of their lobbying power, the determination of
      governments to clamp down on the toxic impacts of legal structures, and different
      legal cultures. However, it remains unclear what the effects on the levels and
      organization of serious crimes for gain are of controls on the professions.

TI  - Backlash Against Globalisation and the Shadow of Phobos.
PG  - 1-19
AB  - This article addresses challenges to the established international order. Its
      critique becomes particularly discernible at the domestic level, where political 
      and economic frameworks are contested by electorates and anti-establishment
      movements in Western countries, engulfed by anti-globalisation sentiments and
      disillusioned with the asymmetric formula of globalisation. Populism implies that
      the ‘social revolt’ facing the West today, regardless of whether it takes place
      in France, Greece, Hungary, Poland, the UK or the USA, is not a legitimate
      response to deep-seated problems but rather is the problem itself. The main aims 
      of this article are to investigate what has caused this surge of support for
      populism in the West; what the role of the default system of economic governance 
      is in inspiring populist resentment; and, finally, what the identity crisis,
      stemming from ‘hyperglobalisation’, and wrecking the social order in Western
      societies has to do with fear, (un)fairness and the redistributive effects of
      economic globalisation.

TI  - Mental toughness and self-efficacy of elite ultra-marathon runners.
LID - e0241284
AB  - Minimal research has examined psychological processes underpinning ultra-marathon
      runners’ performance. This study examined the relationships between mental
      toughness and self-efficacy with performance in an elite sample of ultra-marathon
      runners competing in the 2019 Hawaiian Ultra Running Team’s Trail 100-mile
      endurance run (HURT100). The Mental Toughness Questionnaire (SMTQ) and the
      Endurance Sport Self-Efficacy Scale (ESSES) were completed by 56 elite
      ultra-marathon runners in the HURT100 (38 males, 18 females; Mage = 38.86 years, 
      SDage = 9.23). Findings revealed mental toughness and self-efficacy are highly
      related constructs (r(54) = 0.72, p < 0.001). Mental toughness and self-efficacy 
      did not significantly relate to ultra-marathon performance (mental toughness and 
      self-efficacy with Ultra-Trail World Tour (UTWT) rank F(2, 53) = 0.738, p =
      0.483; mental toughness and self-efficacy with likelihood would finish the
      HURT100 χ2 = 0.56, p = 0.756; mental toughness and self-efficacy with HURT100
      placing and time F(2, 53) = 1.738, p = 0.186 and F(2, 30) = 2.046, p = 0.147,
      respectively). However, participants had significantly and meaningfully higher
      mental toughness (M = 45.42, SD = 4.26, medium and large effect sizes) than
      athletes from other sports previously published. Our interpretation is that these
      results taken in conjunction, suggest a threshold of mental toughness that
      performers require to be of the standard needed to be able to prepare for and
      compete in elite ultra-marathon events such as the HURT100; once this mental
      toughness threshold is met, other factors are likely to be more influential in
      determining elite level ultra-marathon performance.

TI  - A qualitative analysis of vaccine decision makers’ conceptualization and
      fostering of ‘community engagement’ in India.
LID - 185
AB  - Background: Globally, and in India, research has highlighted the importance of
      community engagement in achieving national vaccination goals and in promoting
      health equity. However, community engagement is not well-defined and remains an
      underutilized approach. There is also paucity of literature on community
      engagement’s effectiveness in achieving vaccination outcomes. To address that
      gap, this study interviewed Indian vaccination decision makers to derive a shared
      understanding of the evolving conceptualization of community engagement, and how 
      it has been fostered during India’s Decade of Vaccines (2010-2020). Methods:
      Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 25 purposefully sampled
      national-level vaccine decision makers in India, including policymakers,
      immunization program heads, and vaccine technical committee leads. Participants
      were identified by their ‘elite’ status among decisionmakers in the Indian
      vaccination space. Schutz’ Social Phenomenological Theory guided development of
      an a priori framework derived from the Social Ecological Model. The framework
      helped organize participants’ conceptualizations of communities, community
      engagement, and related themes. Inter-rater reliability was computed for a
      subsample of coded interviews, and findings were validated in a one-day member
      check-in meeting with study participants and teams. Results: The interviews
      successfully elucidated participants’ understanding of key terminology
      (“community”) and approaches to community engagement propagated by the vaccine
      decision makers. Participants conceptualized ‘communities’ as vaccine-eligible
      children, their parents, frontline healthcare workers, and vaccination
      influencers. Engagement with those communities was understood to mean vaccine
      outreach, capacity-building of healthcare workers, and information dissemination.
      However, participants indicated that there were neither explicit policy
      guidelines defining community engagement nor pertinent evaluation metrics,
      despite awareness that community engagement is complex and under-researched.
      Examples of different approaches to community engagement ranged from vaccine
      imposition to empowered community vaccination decision-making. Finally,
      participants proposed an operational definition of community engagement and
      discussed concerns related to implementing it. Conclusions: Although decision
      makers had different perceptions about what constitutes a community, and how
      community engagement should optimally function, the combined group articulated
      its importance to ensure vaccination equity and reiterated the need for concerted
      political will to build trust with communities. At the same time, work remains to
      be done both in terms of research on community engagement as well as development 
      of appropriate implementation and outcome metrics.

TI  - Cross-border reproductive care in the USA: Who comes, why do they come, what do
      they purchase?
PG  - 42-7
AB  - This article explores the participation of non-US-resident patients/clients in
      the US reproductive market, garnering a picture of cross-border reproductive care
      (CBRC) into the USA by drawing on the existing literature, identifying the
      frequency of and motivations for such arrangements, the primary sending
      countries, and the reproductive services sought. I find that although the expense
      of US CBRC necessarily limits the patient/client pool, it is largely non-economic
      factors that drive CBRC into the USA. The US CBRC patient/client base, which is
      diverse in terms of national origin, race and sexual orientation, is recruited by
      the US fertility industry and drawn to the full range of assisted reproductive
      technology (ART) services, such as in-vitro fertilization, surrogacy, oocyte
      donation and preimplantation genetic screening/preimplantation genetic diagnosis,
      available in the US market which are often restricted or limited in their
      countries of origin. CBRC patients/clients enjoy the legal clarity for
      establishing parentage and citizenship for their children available in the USA,
      as well as what some view as a medically and ethically superior ART market.

TI  - Celebrity Politicians as Health-Promoting Role Models in the Media: the Cases of 
      Vladimir Putin, Donald Trump, and Benjamin Netanyahu.
PG  - 1-21
AB  - In recent years, scholars have increasingly revealed the importance of
      celebrities in society, among them celebrity politicians. These celebrities not
      only influence political attitudes but also serve as role models for many
      individuals. Yet, little is known regarding what types of role models’
      politicians serve as in the context of health. To fill this gap, we examined
      three influential contemporary political leaders: Vladimir Putin, Donald Trump
      and Benjamin Netanyahu, and the type of mediated role models each possibly
      comprise in the context of healthy living. By conducting a qualitative content
      analysis, we analyzed 90 articles from 2018 to 2019 from two leading newspapers
      in each of the three politician’s countries, namely Russia, the USA, and Israel
      as well as the respective politician’s Facebook pages. Our findings point to
      three types of potential role models’ as political leaders: a health-promoting
      model (Putin), a hybrid model (Trump), and a model of non-existence (Netanyahu), 
      as the literature points to mediated role models influencing individuals’ beliefs
      and behaviors. This study contributes to the understanding of mediated types of
      role models’ politicians potentially serve as in the context of health vital to
      people’s personal health.

TI  - Trends and inequalities in the nutritional status of adolescent girls and adult
      women in sub-Saharan Africa since 2000: a cross-sectional series study.
LID - e002948
AB  - Introduction: Evidence on the rate at which the double burden of malnutrition
      unfolds is limited. We quantified trends and inequalities in the nutritional
      status of adolescent girls and adult women in sub-Saharan Africa. Methods: We
      analysed 102 Demographic and Health Surveys between 1993 and 2017 from 35
      countries. We assessed regional trends through cross-sectional series analyses
      and ran multilevel linear regression models to estimate the average annual rate
      of change (AARC) in the prevalence of underweight, anaemia, anaemia during
      pregnancy, overweight and obesity among women by their age, residence, wealth and
      education levels. We quantified current absolute inequalities in these indicators
      and wealth-inequality trends. Results: There was a modest decline in underweight 
      prevalence (AARC=−0.14 percentage points (pp), 95% CI −0.17 to -0.11). Anaemia
      declined fastest among adult women and the richest pregnant women with an AARC of
      −0.67 pp (95% CI −1.06 to -0.28) and −0.97 pp (95% CI −1.60 to -0.34),
      respectively, although it affects all women with no marked disparities.
      Overweight is increasing rapidly among adult women and women with no education.
      Capital city residents had a threefold more rapid rise in obesity (AARC=0.47 pp, 
      95% CI 0.39, 0.55), compared with their rural counterparts. Absolute inequalities
      suggest that Ethiopia and South Africa have the largest gap in underweight (15.4 
      pp) and obesity (28.5 pp) respectively, between adult and adolescent women.
      Regional wealth inequalities in obesity are widening by 0.34 pp annually.
      Conclusion: Underweight persists, while overweight and obesity are rising among
      adult women, the rich and capital city residents. Adolescent girls do not present
      adverse nutritional outcomes except anaemia, remaining high among all women.
      Multifaceted responses with an equity lens are needed to ensure no woman is left 
      behind.

      particularly the Estado da Índia (sixteenth to eighteenth centuries).
PG  - 449-66
AB  - This article deals with the presence of physicians, surgeons and apothecaries in 
      the early modern Portuguese empire and the dissemination of medical knowledge
      there. In Portugal itself, the health care sector had been the target of
      considerable royal interference since the final years of the fifteenth century,
      during the construction of the early modern state. Regulatory frameworks were
      established to harmonise health care practice throughout the country and to
      control the organisation and distribution of the available health care
      practitioners among local communities. As this was also the time when Portugal
      was investing heavily in its colonies, how were these policies reflected in the
      empire? Did health care feature in the Portuguese government’s colonial
      strategies? How did the official policy to send medical personnel overseas work
      on the ground? Did it operate at a large enough scale to transform local
      practices?

TI  - Mobilizing collective hatred through humour: Affective–discursive production and 
      reception of populist rhetoric.
PG  - 610-34
AB  - This research examines the mobilization of populist rhetoric of the 2019 Finns
      Party election video. By focusing on both the FP’s election video (production)
      and Youtube users’ comments (reception), we examine the constructions and uses of
      social categories and humour as well as responses to their rhetorical deployment 
      among like‐minded supporters and opponents. The multimodal analysis of the
      production of a populist campaign video demonstrates the construction of social
      categories and humour through the five steps of collective hate. These humorous
      messages are differently received by like‐minded and opposing YouTube users. Two 
      supportive affective–discursive practices – glorification and schadenfreude –
      both express shared joy and laughter, but while glorification emphasizes the
      positive self‐understanding of the in‐group, schadenfreude belittles the
      ‘political Other’. Two opposing affective–discursive practices – irritation and
      scorn – place FP voters in subject positions of morally and intellectually
      inferior fascists, racists, and idiots. The populist message fosters expressions 
      of social anger and polarization between FP supporters and opponents. Humour
      entangled with hatred encourages a sense of moral superiority in both groups.
      This study contributes to the current knowledge of mobilizing populist rhetoric
      and polarization, and responds to the call to broaden analysis of political
      communication in the field of multimodality.

TI  - International consensus statement: methods for recording and reporting of
      epidemiological data on injuries and illnesses in golf.
PG  - 1136-41
AB  - Epidemiological studies of injury in elite and recreational golfers have lacked
      consistency in methods and definitions employed and this limits comparison of
      results across studies. In their sports-generic statement, the Consensus Group
      recruited by the IOC (2020) called for sport-specific consensus statements. On
      invitation by International Golf Federation, a group of international experts in 
      sport and exercise medicine, golf research and sports injury/illness epidemiology
      was selected to prepare a golf-specific consensus statement. Methodological
      stages included literature review and initial drafting, online feedback from the 
      consensus group, revision and second draft, virtual consensus meetings and
      completion of final version. This consensus statement provides golf-specific
      recommendations for data collection and research reporting including: (i) injury 
      and illness definitions, and characteristics with golf-specific examples, (ii)
      definitions of golf-specific exposure measurements and recommendations for the
      calculation of prevalence and incidence, (iii) injury, illness and exposure
      report forms for medical staff and for golfers, and (iv) a baseline
      questionnaire. Implementation of the consensus methodology will enable comparison
      among golf studies and with other sports. It facilitates analysis of causative
      factors for injuries and illness in golf, and can also be used to evaluate the
      effects of prevention programmes to support the health of golfers.

TI  - Structure and function in human and primate social networks: implications for
      diffusion, network stability and health.
LID - 20200446
AB  - The human social world is orders of magnitude smaller than our highly urbanized
      world might lead us to suppose. In addition, human social networks have a very
      distinct fractal structure similar to that observed in other primates. In part,
      this reflects a cognitive constraint, and in part a time constraint, on the
      capacity for interaction. Structured networks of this kind have a significant
      effect on the rates of transmission of both disease and information. Because the 
      cognitive mechanism underpinning network structure is based on trust, internal
      and external threats that undermine trust or constrain interaction inevitably
      result in the fragmentation and restructuring of networks. In contexts where
      network sizes are smaller, this is likely to have significant impacts on
      psychological and physical health risks.

TI  - Nutritional knowledge of youth academy athletes.
LID - 35
AB  - Background: Youth athletes are under increasing pressures to excel in their
      chosen sport and many turn to nutritional supplements in order to enhance sports 
      performance. However, athletes may obtain their nutritional information via
      illegitimate sources such as the internet, media, and other athletes,
      representing miscommunication between sound scientific information and anecdotal 
      experiences. The objective of this investigation was to examine nutrition
      knowledge of elite youth athletes from a non-residential regional academy of
      sport. Methods: A previously validated two-part nutrition knowledge questionnaire
      (NKQ) was administered to 101 (37 male and 64 female) non-residential regional
      Academy of Sport elite youth athletes at an annual training camp. Part 1 of the
      NKQ presented demographic questions. Part 2 presented 90 sports nutrition
      knowledge questions in seven knowledge subcategories (1) Nutrients; (2) Dietary
      reference intakes (DRI); (3) Fluids/Hydration; (4) Recovery; (5) Weight gain; (6)
      Weight loss; and (7) Supplements. Results: The mean NKQ score of all athletes was
      43.8% (± 11.4). No gender differences observed between nutritional knowledge
      total scores, however female athletes recorded more ‘correct’ responses than
      males (p = 0.02) in the Nutrients subcategory. Majority of athletes had
      difficulty identifying correct DRI with this subcategory featuring the lowest
      percentage of ‘correct’ to ‘incorrect’ responses (27.1% ± 2.3; p = 0.02).
      Supplements subcategory displayed much uncertainty with significantly more
      ‘unsure’ than ‘incorrect’ responses (42.4% ± 20.3; p < 0.05). Conclusions: In
      agreement with previous research, results of the current study indicate that
      elite youth athletes lack fundamental nutritional knowledge, specifically related
      to DRI and supplementation. These data provide further support of current
      recommendations that Academy of Sport youth athletes may benefit from integrated 
      nutrition education conducted by qualified nutrition professionals.

TI  - The Quest for a European Safe Asset—A Comparative Legal Analysis of Sovereign
      Bond-Backed Securities, E-Bonds, Purple Bonds, and Coronabonds.
LID - fjaa009
AB  - The European sovereign debt crisis and, more recently, the COVID-19 pandemic have
      revealed the European Economic and Monetary Union’s fragility, which essentially 
      emanates from the inherent tension between a single monetary policy and
      decentralized fiscal policies. To cushion economic and financial shocks and sever
      the sovereign-bank doom loop, different proposals to create a common public debt 
      security have been put forward, although none of them has so far seen the light
      of day. Building on pertinent economic and finance scholarship, this article
      reviews four promising safe asset proposals from a legal perspective: Sovereign
      bond-backed securities (SBBS), E-bonds, Purple bonds, and Coronabonds. Rather
      than focusing on their feasibility under EU law or national constitutional law,
      this article compares the proposals from an investor perspective against the
      backdrop of the following formal and functional legal characteristics that render
      assets ‘safe’: governing law, dispute settlement forum, investor protection, and 
      investor representation in sovereign debt restructurings. Against this backdrop, 
      targeted recommendations on critical design elements of safe assets, with the aim
      of reconciling the economic policy objectives with the pertinent legal
      constraints, are advanced.

TI  - Tweeting in the Time of Coronavirus: How Social Media Use and Academic Research
      Evolve during Times of Global Uncertainty.
LID - 2056305120948258
AB  - Our international research team was in the midst of a comparative study about the
      day-to-day experience of Twitter users in Berlin and Jerusalem through a series
      of daily short surveys, when our Jerusalem data were becoming increasingly
      “compromised” by the growing public concern, and tightening government measures, 
      around the spread of the Coronavirus in Israel. During the two waves of our
      10-day survey of salient Twitter users in Jerusalem (March 9–March 19, N = 34;
      March 23–April 2, N = 25), Israel shifted from 50 confirmed Coronavirus cases to 
      over 6,800 and from relative routine to almost full stay-at-home orders. This
      essay presents two intersecting narratives. First, we consider the methodological
      challenges of adapting ongoing academic survey studies to changing conditions. We
      then offer a mixed-methods analysis of the experiences of our Twitter users and
      how they saw the Coronavirus crisis shaping their use of Twitter. The essay thus 
      offers a unique methodological and empirical vantage point on how social media
      use—and academic research—evolve during times of global uncertainty.

TI  - CerealsDB—new tools for the analysis of the wheat genome: update 2020.
LID - baaa060
AB  - CerealsDB (www.cerealsdb.uk.net) is an online repository of mainly hexaploid
      wheat (Triticum aestivum) single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and genotyping
      data. The CerealsDB website has been designed to enable wheat breeders and
      scientists to select the appropriate markers for research breeding tasks, such as
      marker-assisted selection. We report a large update of genotyping information for
      over 6000 wheat accessions and describe new webtools for exploring and
      visualizing the data. We also describe a new database of quantitative trait loci 
      that links phenotypic traits to CerealsDB SNP markers and allelic scores for each
      of those markers. CerealsDB is an open-access website that hosts information on
      wheat SNPs considered useful for both plant breeders and research scientists. The
      latest CerealsDB database is available at
      https://www.cerealsdb.uk.net/cerealgenomics/CerealsDB/indexNEW.php.

TI  - A footprint of plant eco-geographic adaptation on the composition of the barley
      rhizosphere bacterial microbiota.
LID - 12916
AB  - The microbiota thriving in the rhizosphere, the thin layer of soil surrounding
      plant roots, plays a critical role in plant’s adaptation to the environment.
      Domestication and breeding selection have progressively differentiated the
      microbiota of modern crops from the ones of their wild ancestors. However, the
      impact of eco-geographical constraints faced by domesticated plants and crop wild
      relatives on recruitment and maintenance of the rhizosphere microbiota remains to
      be fully elucidated. Here we performed a comparative 16S rRNA gene survey of the 
      rhizosphere of 4 domesticated and 20 wild barley (Hordeum vulgare) genotypes
      grown in an agricultural soil under controlled environmental conditions. We
      demonstrated the enrichment of individual bacteria mirrored the distinct
      eco-geographical constraints faced by their host plants. Unexpectedly, Elite
      varieties exerted a stronger genotype effect on the rhizosphere microbiota when
      compared with wild barley genotypes adapted to desert environments with a
      preferential enrichment for members of Actinobacteria. Finally, in wild barley
      genotypes, we discovered a limited, but significant, correlation between
      microbiota diversity and host genomic diversity. Our results revealed a footprint
      of the host’s adaptation to the environment on the assembly of the bacteria
      thriving at the root–soil interface. In the tested conditions, this recruitment
      cue layered atop of the distinct evolutionary trajectories of wild and
      domesticated plants and, at least in part, is encoded by the barley genome. This 
      knowledge will be critical to design experimental approaches aimed at elucidating
      the recruitment cues of the barley microbiota across a range of soil types.

TI  - Reliability of a musculoskeletal profiling test battery in elite academy soccer
      players.
LID - e0236341
AB  - The study aimed to quantify the measurement error / reliability of a
      musculoskeletal profiling test battery administered in young, elite academy
      soccer players, and to examine if the order in which the test battery was
      administered, and who it was administered by, influenced reliability. Players (n 
      = 75; age 12–20 years; stature 1.47–1.95 m; body mass 36–89 kg) from U-12 to U-23
      age groups were assigned to either: 1) intra-rater-fixed order; 2)
      intra-rater-non-fixed order; 3) inter-rater-fixed order; or, 4)
      inter-rater-non-fixed order groups. On two separate occasions separated by 3 to 7
      days, 12 raters conducted a musculoskeletal profiling test battery comprising 10 
      tests (Supine Medial Hip Rotation, Supine Lateral Hip Rotation, Hamstring 90/90, 
      Prone Medial Hip Rotation [degrees]; Combined Elevation, Thoracic Rotation,
      Weight-Bearing Dorsiflexion, Y-Balance [centimetres]; Beighton, Lumbar Quadrant
      [categorical]). The measurement error / reliability for tests measured in degrees
      and centimetres was evaluated using the intraclass correlation (relative
      reliability), coefficient of variation and ratio limits of agreement (absolute
      reliability). Intraclass correlations varied from 0.04 (“poor”) to 0.95
      (“excellent”), coefficient of variation from 2.9 to 43.4%, and the ratio limits
      of agreement from 1.058 (*/÷ 1.020) to 2.026 (*/÷ 1.319) for the tests measured
      in degrees and centimetres. The intraclass correlation, coefficient of variation 
      and ratio limits of agreement were smallest for five out of eight tests measured 
      in degrees and centimetres when the tests were administered in an
      intra-rater-fixed test order. These findings emphasise that different testing
      methods, and the administration of a musculoskeletal profiling test battery using
      a less than optimal design, will influence measurement error and hence test
      reliability. These observations need to be considered when investigating
      musculoskeletal function and age, injury, training or asymmetry in young, elite
      academy soccer players.

TI  - Admission policies and methods at crossroads: a review of medical school
      admission policies and methods in seven Asian countries.
PG  - 243-56
AB  - Selecting the right applicants is an important part of medical student admission.
      While one universally accepted selection criterion is academic capacity, there
      are other criteria such as communication skills and local criteria (e.g.,
      socio-cultural values) that are no less important. This article reviews the
      policies and methods of selection to medical schools in seven countries with
      varying socio-economic conditions and healthcare systems. Senior academics
      involved in medical education in Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, the Philippines,
      Singapore, Sri Lanka, and Taiwan completed a pre-agreed pro-forma per each
      country to describe the country’s admission policies and methods. The details
      were then compared and contrasted. This review identifies tension between many of
      the policies and methods used in medical school admissions, such as between the
      need to assess non-cognitive abilities and widen access, and between the need for
      more medical professionals and the requirement to set high entry standards.
      Finding the right balance requires careful consideration of all variables,
      including the country’s human resource needs; socio-economic status; graduates’
      expected competencies; and the school’s vision, mission, and availability of
      resources.

TI  - Modelling the maximal active consumption rate and its plasticity in
      humans—perspectives from hot dog eating competitions.
LID - 20200096
AB  - Gut capacity and plasticity have been examined across multiple species, but are
      not typically explored in the context of extreme human performance. Here, I
      estimate the theoretical maximal active consumption rate (ACR) in humans, using
      39 years of historical data from the annual Nathan's Famous Hot Dog Eating
      Contest. Through nonlinear modelling and generalized extreme value analysis, I
      show that humans are theoretically capable of achieving an ACR of approximately
      832 g min−1 fresh matter over 10 min duration. Modelling individual performances 
      across 5 years reveals that maximal ACR significantly increases over time in
      ‘elite’ competitive eaters, likely owing to training effects. Extreme digestive
      plasticity suggests that eating competition records are quite biologically
      impressive, especially in the context of carnivorous species and other human
      athletic competitions.

TI  - Four Loci Are Associated with Cardiorespiratory Fitness and Endurance Performance
      in Young Chinese Females.
LID - 10117
AB  - Cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) and endurance performance are characterized by a 
      complex genetic trait with high heritability. Although research has identified
      many physiological and environmental correlates with CRF, the genetic
      architecture contributing to CRF remains unclear, especially in non-athlete
      population. A total of 762 Chinese young female participants were recruited and
      an endurance run test was used to determine CRF. We used a fixed model of
      genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for CRF. Genotyping was performed using
      the Affymetrix Axiom and illumina 1 M arrays. After quality control and
      imputation, a linear regression-based association analysis was conducted using a 
      total of 5,149,327 variants. Four loci associated with CRF were identified to
      reach genome-wide significance (P < 5.0 × 10-8), which located in 15q21.3
      (rs17240160, P = 1.73 × 10-9, GCOM1), 3q25.31 (rs819865, P = 8.56 × 10-9, GMPS), 
      21q22.3 (rs117828698, P = 9.59 × 10-9, COL18A1), and 17q24.2 (rs79806428,
      P = 3.85 × 10-8, PRKCA). These loci (GCOM1, GMPS, COL18A1 and PRKCA) associated
      with cardiorespiratory fitness and endurance performance in Chinese non-athlete
      young females. Our results suggest that these gene polymorphisms provide further 
      genetic evidence for the polygenetic nature of cardiorespiratory endurance and be
      used as genetic biomarkers for future research.

TI  - Reorienting entrepreneurial support infrastructure to tackle a social crisis: A
      rapid response.
PG  - e00181
AB  - Chile is experiencing its worst economic and social crisis in decades, which is
      adversely impacting entrepreneurs and SMEs. Chile’s Economic Development Agency
      is seeking to support recovery efforts by reorienting its entrepreneurship
      programs and ecosystem support capacity. What makes the reorientation especially 
      challenging is the need to ensure all actions are sensitive to the causes of the 
      social unrest, where arguably extant entrepreneurship policy has played a role.
      Theory and evidence in entrepreneurship literature seem insufficient to inform
      immediate actions. In this rapid response paper, we leverage and translate
      research on ecosystem democracy, spontaneous venturing and
      entrepreneurship-enabled social cohesion to inform decision-making and contribute
      to the development of policy solutions. We propose an entrepreneurship policy
      reorientation model, including interventions during and post crisis, potentially 
      capable of minimizing the effects of the crisis and changing the orientation of
      future support.

TI  - Recurrent inversion toggling and great ape genome evolution.
PG  - 849-58
AB  - Inversions play an important role in disease and evolution but are difficult to
      characterize because their breakpoints map to large repeats. We increased by
      six-fold the number (n = 1,069) of previously reported great ape inversions using
      Strand-seq and long-read sequencing. We find that the X chromosome is most
      enriched (2.5-fold) for inversions based on its size and duplication content.
      There is an excess of differentially expressed primate genes near the breakpoints
      of large (>100 kb) inversions but not smaller events. We show that when great ape
      lineage-specific duplications emerge they preferentially (~75%) occur in an
      inverted orientation compared to their ancestral locus. We construct
      megabase-pair-scale haplotypes for individual chromosomes and identify 23 genomic
      regions that have recurrently toggled between a direct and inverted state over 15
      million years. The direct orientation is most frequently the derived state for
      human polymorphisms that predispose to recurrent copy number variants associated 
      with neurodevelopmental disease.

TI  - Injury surveillance in elite Paralympic athletes with limb deficiency: a
      retrospective analysis of upper quadrant injuries.
LID - 36
AB  - Background: Compared to injury surveillance in Olympic athletes relatively little
      literature exists for Paralympic athletes. Injury surveillance data underpin
      design and evaluation of injury prevention strategies in elite sport. The aim of 
      this study is investigate upper quadrant injuries in elite athletes with limb
      deficiency. Methods: A retrospective analysis of upper quadrant injuries in elite
      athletes with limb deficiency with available data (2008–2016) was conducted using
      medical notes extracted from English Institute of Sport (EIS) records.
      Eligibility criteria included funded athletes, eligible for EIS physiotherapy
      support with an upper and/or lower limb disability arising from full or partial
      limb deficiency. Results: A total 162 injuries from 34 athletes were included.
      Participant characteristics: 20 males (59%), from 9 sports, with mean age
      27 years (range 16–50 years) and 15 with congenital limb loss (44%). Athletes age
      20–29 years experienced most injuries, four per athlete. The glenohumeral joint
      was the reported injury site (23%, n = 38). Index (first) injuries accounted for 
      77% (n = 128) injuries, 17% (n = 28) a recurrence and 6% (n = 10) an
      exacerbation. More than half of injuries occurred in training (58%, n = 94), this
      being slightly higher in those with traumatic limb loss. Athletes with quadruple 
      levels of limb deficiency had double the number of recurrent injuries as those
      with single or double limb deficiency. Conclusion: Elite athletes with limb
      deficiency experience upper quadrant injuries, with glenohumeral joint the most
      frequently reported. The quality and consistency of data reported limits
      definitive conclusions, although findings highlight the importance of precision
      and accuracy in recording injury surveillance to enable implementation of
      effective injury prevention strategies.

TI  - Cybernetic combatants support the importance of duels in the evolution of extreme
      weapons.
LID - 20200254
AB  - A current evolutionary hypothesis predicts that the most extreme forms of animal 
      weaponry arise in systems where combatants fight each other one-to-one, in duels.
      It has also been suggested that arms races in human interstate conflicts are more
      likely to escalate in cases where there are only two opponents. However, directly
      testing whether duels matter for weapon investment is difficult in animals and
      impossible in interstate conflicts. Here, we test whether superior combatants
      experience a disproportionate advantage in duels, as compared with
      multi-combatant skirmishes, in a system analogous to both animal and military
      contests: the battles fought by artificial intelligence agents in a computer war 
      game. We found that combatants with experimentally improved fighting power had a 
      large advantage in duels, but that this advantage deteriorated as the complexity 
      of the battlefield was increased by the addition of further combatants. This
      pattern remained under the two different forms of the advantage granted to our
      focal artificial intelligence (AI) combatants, and became reversed when we
      switched the roles to feature a weak focal AI among strong opponents. Our results
      suggest that one-on-one combat may trigger arms races in diverse systems. These
      results corroborate the outcomes of studies of both animal and interstate
      contests, and suggest that elements of animal contest theory may be widely
      applicable to arms races generally.

TI  - ‘This country is OURS’: The exclusionary potential of collective psychological
      ownership.
LID - e12386
AB  - Political campaign slogans, such as ‘Take back control of our country’ (United
      Kingdom Independence Party) and ‘The Netherlands ours again’ (Dutch Party for
      Freedom), indicate that right‐wing populism appeals to the belief that the
      country is ‘ours’, and therefore, ‘we’ have the exclusive right to determine what
      happens. We examined this sense of ownership of the country (i.e. collective
      psychological ownership [CPO]) with the related determination right in relation
      to exclusionary attitudes and voting behaviour. Among Dutch (Study 1, N = 572)
      and British (Study 2, N = 495) participants, we found that CPO explained
      anti‐immigrant and anti‐EU attitudes, and these attitudes in turn accounted for
      voting ‘leave’ in the 2016 Brexit referendum in the British sample (Study 2).
      Additionally, CPO was more strongly related to negative immigrant attitudes among
      right‐wing Dutch participants, whereas it was more strongly related to negative
      EU attitudes and voting ‘leave’ among left‐wing British participants. CPO
      contributes to the understanding of critical contemporary social attitudes and
      political behaviour.

TI  - Incompleteness of urban infrastructures in transition: Scenarios from the mobile 
      age in Nairobi.
PG  - 728-50
AB  - Work in policy and research circles tends to depict urban infrastructural
      heterogeneity as synonymous with failure or brokenness. Inherent in this tendency
      is the often-subtle expectation that infrastructures should evolve as do their
      counterparts elsewhere, or in a linear trajectory from less complete to more
      complete arrangements. This article opposes such completist lures and
      inclinations. I recuperate the notion of incompleteness as a constitutive feature
      and explanatory category for urban infrastructures that, while diverging from
      so-called norms and ideals, cannot be described as failed or broken. I argue
      that, rather than devising universalizing solutions to processes of
      infrastructural heterogeneity, it is perhaps better to see infrastructures as
      emergent, shifting and thus incomplete. I make this case looking at three
      successive infrastructures in Nairobi: the Simu ya Jamii kiosk, the M-Pesa stall 
      and the M-Pesa platform. I examine these infrastructures not simply as raw
      materials or empirical conduits, but as the very starting point in theorizing
      urban infrastructures from the South. Ultimately, this study not only opens up a 
      vital frame for situated analysis and understanding of urban infrastructures in
      transition, it also adds to and extends STS analytical frames into non-Northern
      contexts.

TI  - The Third Wave: The International Financial Crisis and Refugees.
PG  - 131-207
AB  - This chapter examines the third wave of nativist populism in the post-war era,
      which began to brew in the wake of the International Financial Crisis starting in
      2008. A fundamental shift occurred in the third wave with the Refugee Crisis
      heightening in 2015. Nativist populism spread further into the mainstream in
      European and American politics than ever before, for instance bringing Brexit to 
      the UK, Donald Trump to power in America and Marine Le Pen qualifying to the
      second round in the presidential elections in France. Indeed, this was a
      brand-new world. The four largest democracies in the world—Brazil, Indonesia and 
      India in addition to the US—were all governed by politicians often labelled as
      being populist. With the Coronavirus Crisis of 2020 nationalist sentiments were
      hightening again.Whichever way we attempt to slice this trend, the third wave
      brought a fundamental shift in the evolution of nativist populism and came to
      constitute a clear trend of Neo-Nationalism spreading across Europe, America and 
      elsewhere.

TI  - Understanding Nativist Populism.
PG  - 29-52
AB  - This chapter discusses the main contribution of this study, which is in
      separating nativist populism from other kinds within the populist family. The
      convergence of nativism and populism has turned into a separate Neo-Nationalism
      spreading across Europe and America. In mapping their historical evolution
      through three waves and identifying common qualities, the book provides context
      for studying the rise of nativist populists. This chapter lays out how
      Neo-Nationalism of contemporary nativist populists should be understood. It
      identifies a winning formula of nativist populists, the dual process of instating
      fear and scapegoating.The chapter discusses discursive manipulations and
      structural inequities in the rhetoric of contemporary nativist populists. The
      surge of populist politics examined in this book has brought back the importance 
      of dialectic observation, examining populism as countering mainstream politics.
      Another contribution here is in identifying a threefold claim which nativist
      populists put forth in their support of the people.

AB  - Objectives: This project examined risk factors of disordered eating in athletes
      by adapting and applying a theoretical model. It tested a previously proposed
      theoretical model and explored the utility of a newly formed model within an
      athletic population across gender, age, and sport type to explain disordered
      eating. Design: The design was cross-sectional and the first phase in a series of
      longitudinal studies. Methods: 1,017 athletes completed online questionnaires
      related to social pressures, internalisation, body dissatisfaction, negative
      affect, restriction, and bulimia. Structural equation modelling was employed to
      analyse the fit of the measurement and structural models and to do invariance
      testing. Results: The original theoretical model failed to achieve acceptable
      goodness of fit (χ2 [70, 1017] = 1043.07; p < .0001. CFI = .55; GFI = .88; NFI = 
      .53; RMSEA = .12 [90% CI = .111-.123]). Removal of non-significant pathways and
      addition of social media resulted in the model achieving a parsimonious goodness 
      of fit (χ2 [19, 1017] = 77.58; p < .0001. CFI = .96; GFI = .98; NFI = .95; RMSEA 
      = .055 [90% CI = .043-.068]). Invariance tests revealed that the newly revised
      model differed across gender, age, level, competition status, and length of sport
      participation. Conclusion: This study showed that the formation of disordered
      eating symptomology might not be associated with sport pressures experienced by
      athletes. It revealed that disordered eating development varies across gender,
      competition level, sport type, and age, which must be considered to prevent and
      treat disordered eating in athletes.

TI  - Patient and Public Involvement of young people with a chronic condition in
      projects in health and social care: A scoping review.
PG  - 789-801
AB  - Background: The involvement of young people with a chronic condition in research 
      and implementation projects in health and social care receives growing attention.
      Yet, there is a lack of conceptual clarity of this so‐called ‘Patient and Public 
      Involvement’ (PPI) and methods to systematically evaluate it are absent. This
      scoping review aimed to gain insight into developments in the existing literature
      on PPI of young people with a chronic condition by mapping reported definitions, 
      goals, activities, experiences and impact. Methods: We conducted searches in
      Cinahl, Embase, PsycINFO, PubMed and Scopus. Included articles described
      involvement of young people with a chronic condition in research and
      implementation projects, contained empirical data, were written in English and
      were published after 1990. Two researchers independently carried out the data
      extraction. Results: Twenty‐three studies out of 4993 initial hits met the
      inclusion criteria. We found great variation in definitions and
      operationalizations of PPI. Reflections of authors on the process of PPI and its 
      impact were similar and did not change over the years. Discussion and conclusion:
      Limited progress in the evidence base of the impact of PPI with young people with
      a chronic condition was found. Over the years, studies continue to report similar
      experiences and challenges. In order to move forward, we suggest future research 
      to make connections to existing work instead, to include thorough descriptions of
      what is understood by PPI and how this is translated into activities, and to use 
      systematic and objective, but also flexible, methods to measure its impact.

TI  - Prevalence of secondary care multimorbidity in mid-life and its association with 
      premature mortality in a large longitudinal cohort study.
LID - e033622
AB  - Objectives: Multimorbidity is the coexistence of two or more health conditions in
      an individual. Multimorbidity in younger adults is increasingly recognised as an 
      important challenge. We assessed the prevalence of secondary care multimorbidity 
      in mid-life and its association with premature mortality over 15 years of
      follow-up, in the Aberdeen Children of the 1950s (ACONF) cohort. Method: A
      prospective cohort study using linked electronic health and mortality records.
      Scottish ACONF participants were linked to their Scottish Morbidity Record
      hospital episode data and mortality records. Multimorbidity was defined as two or
      more conditions and was assessed using healthcare records in 2001 when the
      participants were aged between 45 and 51 years. The association between
      multimorbidity and mortality over 15 years of follow-up (to ages 60–66 years) was
      assessed using Cox proportional hazards regression. There was also adjustment for
      key covariates: age, gender, social class at birth, intelligence at age 7,
      secondary school type, educational attainment, alcohol, smoking, body mass index 
      and adult social class. Results: Of 9625 participants (51% males), 3% had
      multimorbidity. The death rate per 1000 person-years was 28.4 (95% CI 23.2 to
      34.8) in those with multimorbidity and 5.7 (95% CI 5.3 to 6.1) in those without. 
      In relation to the reference group of those with no multimorbidity, those with
      multimorbidity had a mortality HR of 4.5 (95% CI 3.4 to 6.0) over 15 years and
      this association remained when fully adjusted for the covariates (HR 2.5 (95% CI 
      1.5 to 4.0)). Conclusion: Multimorbidity prevalence was 3% in mid-life when
      measured using secondary care administrative data. Multimorbidity in mid-life was
      associated with premature mortality.

TI  - Molecular Markers Associated with Agro-Physiological Traits under Terminal
      Drought Conditions in Bread Wheat.
LID - 3156
AB  - Terminal drought stress poses a big challenge to sustain wheat grain production
      in rain-fed environments. This study aimed to utilize the genetically diverse
      pre-breeding lines for identification of genomic regions associated with
      agro-physiological traits at terminal stage drought stress in wheat. A total of
      339 pre-breeding lines panel derived from three-way crosses of ‘exotics × elite ×
      elite’ lines were evaluated in field conditions at Obregon, Mexico for two years 
      under well irrigated as well as drought stress environments. Drought stress was
      imposed at flowering by skipping the irrigations at pre and post anthesis stage. 
      Results revealed that drought significantly reduced grain yield (Y), spike length
      (SL), number of grains spikes−1 (NGS) and thousand kernel weight (TKW), while
      kernel abortion (KA) was increased. Population structure analysis in this panel
      uncovered three sub-populations. Genome wide linkage disequilibrium (LD) decay
      was observed at 2.5 centimorgan (cM). The haplotypes-based genome wide
      association study (GWAS) identified significant associations of Y, SL, and TKW on
      three chromosomes; 4A (HB10.7), 2D (HB6.10) and 3B (HB8.12), respectively.
      Likewise, associations on chromosomes 6B (HB17.1) and 3A (HB7.11) were found for 
      NGS while on chromosome 3A (HB7.12) for KA. The genomic analysis information
      generated in the study can be efficiently utilized to improve Y and/or related
      parameters under terminal stage drought stress through marker-assisted breeding.

TI  - Levels of Heterochiasmy During Arabidopsis Development as Reported by Fluorescent
      Tagged Lines.
PG  - 2103-10
AB  - Crossing over, the exchange of DNA between the chromosomes during meiosis,
      contributes significantly to genetic variation. The rate of crossovers (CO)
      varies depending upon the taxon, population, age, external conditions, and also, 
      sometimes, between the sexes, a phenomenon called heterochiasmy. In the model
      plant Arabidopsis thaliana, the male rate of all crossover events (mCO) is
      typically nearly double the female rate (fCO). A previous, PCR-based genotyping
      study has reported that the disparity decreases with increasing parental age,
      because fCO rises while mCO remains stable. We revisited this topic using a
      fluorescent tagged lines approach to examine how heterochiasmy responded to
      parental age in eight genomic intervals distributed across the organism’s five
      chromosomes. We determined recombination frequency for, on average, more than
      2000 seeds, for each interval, for each of four age groups, to estimate
      sex-specific CO rates. mCO did not change with age, as reported previously, but, 
      here, fCO did not rise, and thus the levels of heterochiasmy were unchanged. We
      can see no methodological reason to doubt that our results reflect the underlying
      biology of the accessions we studied. The lack of response to age could perhaps
      be due to previously reported variation in CO rate among accessions of
      Arabidopsis.

TI  - Insomnia and the late nineteenth-century insomniac: the case of Albert Kimball.
LID - 20190074
AB  - This article explores the emergence, in late nineteenth-century Britain and the
      USA, of the ‘insomniac’ as a distinct pathological and social archetype.
      Sleeplessness has of course been a human problem for millennia, but only since
      the late-Victorian period has there been a specific diagnostic name for the
      individual who suffers chronically from insufficient sleep. The introductory
      section of the article, which notes the current panic about sleep problems,
      offers a brief sketch of the history of sleeplessness, acknowledging the
      transhistorical nature of this condition but also pointing to the appearance,
      during the period of the Enlightenment, of the term ‘insomnia’ itself. The second
      section makes more specific historical claims about the rise of insomnia in the
      accelerating conditions of everyday life in urban society at the end of the
      nineteenth century. It traces the rise of the insomniac as such, especially in
      the context of medical debates about ‘neurasthenia’, as someone whose identity is
      constitutively defined by their inability to sleep. The third section, tightening
      the focus of the article, goes on to reconstruct the biography of one exemplary
      late nineteenth-century insomniac, the American dentist Albert Kimball, in order 
      to illustrate the claim that insomnia was one of the pre-eminent symptoms of a
      certain crisis in industrial and metropolitan modernity as this social condition 
      was lived by individuals at the fin de siècle.

TI  - Analysis of Polymorphic Variants of the Dopamine Transporter (DAT1) Gene
      Polymorphism and Personality Traits Among Athletes.
PG  - 79-89
AB  - Personality traits, especially in sport are modulatory factors of athletes’
      behavior – his/ her conscientiousness, the will to achieve an aim, perseverance
      and motivation of activity. Not only are biological predispositions related to
      anatomical or biochemical traits of success, but they are also largely determined
      by personality traits that result from genetic factors. In our research we joined
      tests of athlete’s personality in correlation with genotypes of the dopamine
      transporter (DAT1) gene polymorphism. The selection of this polymorphism was
      based on previous reports connecting the influence of dopamine with motivation
      and numerous arguments supporting its correlation with human behavior. We
      observed significant differences among polymorphisms DAT 9/9, 9/10, 10/10 in
      terms of proportion of particular genotypes between athletes and the control
      group. We also found significant differences in the NEO FFI sten scale for
      conscientiousness. We noticed that anxiety was related with genotypic variants of
      DAT1, specifically the 9/10 VNTR variant, which conditioned lower levels of
      anxiety in the group of tested athletes. By contrast, the lower sten value of
      agreeability was statistically significant for the group of athletes that were
      carriers of the 10/10 VNTR genotype. Heterozygous 9/10 VNTR among athletes showed
      lower levels of anxiety in comparison with the control group, whereas
      agreeability determined using the NEO FFI scale represented a lower value among
      athletes that had the 10/10 polymorphism. We may thus conclude that the presence 
      of polymorphic variants of the dopamine transporter gene corresponds to athletes’
      personality traits.

TI  - Global Research Output on Sleep Research in Athletes from 1966 to 2019: A
      Bibliometric Analysis.
PG  - 99-119
AB  - This study examined sleep research in athletes published between 1966 and 2019,
      through a bibliometric analysis of research output in the Scopus database.
      Following a robust assessment of titles, the bibliometric indicators of
      productivity for studies included in the final analysis were: Distribution of
      publications and citations (excluding self-citations), top ten active journals,
      countries, institutions and authors, single- and multi-country collaboration, and
      25 top-cited papers. Out of the 1015 papers, 313 were included in the final
      analysis. The majority of the papers were research articles (n = 259; 82.8%) and 
      published in English (n = 295; 94.3%). From 2011, there was a dramatic increase
      in papers published (n = 257; 82.1%) and citations (n = 3538; 91.0%). The number 
      of collaborations increased after 2001, with papers published through
      international (n = 81; 25.9%) and national (n = 192; 61.3%) collaboration.
      Australia was the most prolific country in terms of number of publications (n =
      97; 31.0%), and citations (n = 1529; 15.8%). In conclusion, after the beginning
      of the twenty-first century, the scientific production on sleep research in
      athletes has seen significant growth in publication and citation output. Future
      research should focus on interventions to improve sleep in athletes.

TI  - How Do Academic Elites March Through Departments? A Comparison of the Most
      Eminent Economists and Sociologists’ Career Trajectories.
PG  - 343-65
AB  - This article compares the career trajectories and mobility patterns of Nobel
      Laureates in economics with those of highly cited sociologists to evaluate a
      theory advanced by Richard Whitley that postulates a nexus between the overall
      intellectual structure of a discipline and the composition of its elite. The
      theory predicts that the most eminent scholars in internally fragmented
      disciplines such as sociology will vary in their departmental affiliations and
      academic career paths, while disciplines such as economics with strong linkages
      between specialties and shared standards of excellence will be dominated by a
      more homogeneous elite. The comparison provides strong empirical evidence in
      favor of Whitley’s theory. The careers of the most eminent economists are closely
      tied to the top five departments of the discipline, whereas the career pathways
      to eminence in sociology are largely unpredictable.Electronic supplementary

TI  - Genetics and the Elite Athlete: Our Understanding in 2020.
PG  - 256-63
AB  - Modern competitive sport has evolved so much that athletes would go to great
      extremes to develop themselves into champions; medicine has also evolved to the
      point that many genetic elements have been identified to be associated with
      specific athletic traits, and genetic alterations are also possible. The current 
      review examines the published literature and looks at three important factors:
      genetic polymorphism influencing sporting ability, gene doping and genetic
      tendency to injury. The ACTN3 gene has an influence on type II muscle fibres,
      with the R allele being advantageous to power sports like sprinting and the XX
      genotype being associated with lower muscle strength and sprinting ability. The
      ACE gene polymorphisms are associated with cardio-respiratory efficiency and
      could influence endurance athletes. Many other genes are being looked at, with
      specific focus on those that are potentially related to enhancement of athletic
      ability. Recognition of these specific gene polymorphisms brings into play the
      concept of genetic engineering in athletes, which constitutes gene doping and is 
      outlawed. This has the potential to develop into the next big threat in elite
      sports; gene doping could have dangerous and even fatal outcomes, as the
      knowledge of gene therapy is still in its infancy. Genetic predisposition to
      injury is also being identified; recent publications have increased the awareness
      of gene polymorphisms predisposing to injuries of ligaments and tendons due to
      influence on collagen structure and extracellular matrix. Ongoing work is looking
      at identifying the same genes from different races and different sexes to see if 
      there are quantitative racial or sexual differences. All of the above have led to
      serious ethical concerns; in the twenty-first century some sports associations
      and some countries are looking at genetic testing for their players.
      Unfortunately, the science is still developing, and the experience of its
      application is limited worldwide. Nevertheless, this field has caught the
      imagination of both the public and the sportsperson, and hence the concerned
      doctors should be aware of the potential problems and current issues involved in 
      understanding genetic traits and polymorphisms, genetic testing and genetic
      engineering.

TI  - There and back again: A zooarchaeological perspective on Early and Middle Bronze 
      Age urbanism in the southern Levant.
LID - e0227255
AB  - Multiple arguments for or against the presence of ‘urban’ settlements in the
      Early Bronze Age of the southern Levant have identified the need to compare these
      settlements against their rural hinterlands through multiple lines of evidence.
      This meta-analysis of zooarchaeological data from the region compares and
      identifies patterns of animal production, provisioning and consumption between
      the supposed “urban” and rural sites of the southern Levant from the Early Bronze
      (EB) against the (more widely recognised urban) Middle Bronze (MB) Ages. It also 
      identifies distinct and regionally specific patterns in animal production and
      consumption that can be detected between urban and rural sites of the southern
      Levant. The taxonomic and age profiles from EB Ia and Ib sites do not demonstrate
      any urban versus rural differentiation patterning, even though fortifications
      appear in the EB Ib. Beginning in the EB II and clearly visible in the EB III,
      there is differentiation between rural and urban sites in the taxonomic and age
      proportions. Differentiation is repeated in the MB II. The clear differentiation 
      between “urban” and rural zooarchaeological assemblages from the EB II-III and MB
      suggest that rural sites are provisioning the larger fortified settlements. This 
      pattern indicates that these sites are indeed urban in nature, and these
      societies are organized at the state-level. From the EB II onwards, there is a
      clear bias in the large centres towards the consumption of cattle and of subadult
      sheep and goats with a corresponding bias in smaller rural sites towards the
      consumption of adult sheep and goats and a reduced presence of cattle. After the 
      emergence of this differential pattern, it disappears with the decline in social 
      complexity at the end of the Early Bronze Age, only to come ‘back again’ with the
      re-emergence of urban settlement systems in the Middle Bronze Age.

TI  - Dual threshold optimization and network inference reveal convergent evidence from
      TF binding locations and TF perturbation responses.
PG  - 459-71
AB  - A high-confidence map of the direct, functional targets of each transcription
      factor (TF) requires convergent evidence from independent sources. Two
      significant sources of evidence are TF binding locations and the transcriptional 
      responses to direct TF perturbations. Systematic data sets of both types exist
      for yeast and human, but they rarely converge on a common set of direct,
      functional targets for a TF. Even the few genes that are both bound and
      responsive may not be direct functional targets. Our analysis shows that when
      there are many nonfunctional binding sites and many indirect targets,
      nonfunctional sites are expected to occur in the cis-regulatory DNA of indirect
      targets by chance. To address this problem, we introduce dual threshold
      optimization (DTO), a new method for setting significance thresholds on binding
      and perturbation-response data, and show that it improves convergence. It also
      enables comparison of binding data to perturbation-response data that have been
      processed by network inference algorithms, which further improves convergence.
      The combination of dual threshold optimization and network inference greatly
      expands the high-confidence TF network map in both yeast and human. Next, we
      analyze a comprehensive new data set measuring the transcriptional response
      shortly after inducing overexpression of a yeast TF. We also present a new yeast 
      binding location data set obtained by transposon calling cards and compare it to 
      recent ChIP-exo data. These new data sets improve convergence and expand the
      high-confidence network synergistically.

TI  - Cerebrospinal fluid soluble CD30 elevation despite suppressive antiretroviral
      therapy in individuals living with HIV-1 .
PG  - 19-26
AB  - Objectives: The aim of this study was to assess soluble CD30 (sCD30), a protein
      that colocalises with HIV-1 RNA and DNA in lymphoid cells and tissues, in
      cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) as a marker of HIV-1 infection in the central nervous
      system (CNS). Methods: This was a cross-sectional study using archived samples
      from two clinical cohorts. Soluble CD30 concentrations were measured in paired
      CSF and plasma from untreated viraemic individuals (n=52), individuals on
      suppressive antiretroviral therapy (ART) (n=33), HIV-1 controllers (n=10),
      participants with CSF HIV-1 ‘escape’ (n=11) and controls without HIV-1 infection 
      (n=16). Nonparametric tests were used to compare levels across groups and
      evaluate correlations with HIV-1 RNA, CSF neurofilament light chain protein (NFL)
      and neopterin. Results: Compared with controls (median 30 ng/mL, interquartile
      range [IRQ] 23–50), plasma sCD30 levels were elevated in viraemic participants
      (75 ng/mL, 52–116; P<0.001), but not in those on suppressive ART (38 ng/mL,
      32–62). In contrast, CSF sCD30 levels were elevated in ART-suppressed individuals
      (34 ng/mL, 19–46; P=0.001) and in those with CSF ‘escape’ (33 ng/mL, 27–40;
      P=0.004) compared with controls (18 ng/mL, 11–23), but not in untreated viraemic 
      individuals. No association was observed between CSF sCD30 and plasma HIV-1 RNA, 
      concurrent or nadir CD4+ T cell count, duration of infection or plasma sCD30. CSF
      sCD30 correlated with CSF NFL (r=0.34, P=0.001). Conclusions: In contrast to
      plasma, sCD30 levels are elevated in the CSF of individuals with HIV-1 infection 
      who are on suppressive ART. Elevated levels of sCD30 in the CSF may be an
      indicator of persistent CNS HIV-1 infection, although the mechanism underlying
      this elevation warrants further investigation.

TI  - International Olympic Committee consensus statement: methods for recording and
      reporting of epidemiological data on injury and illness in sport 2020 (including 
      STROBE Extension for Sport Injury and Illness Surveillance (STROBE-SIIS)).
PG  - 372-89
AB  - Injury and illness surveillance, and epidemiological studies, are fundamental
      elements of concerted efforts to protect the health of the athlete. To encourage 
      consistency in the definitions and methodology used, and to enable data across
      studies to be compared, research groups have published 11 sport-specific or
      setting-specific consensus statements on sports injury (and, eventually, illness)
      epidemiology to date. Our objective was to further strengthen consistency in data
      collection, injury definitions and research reporting through an updated set of
      recommendations for sports injury and illness studies, including a new
      Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE)
      checklist extension. The IOC invited a working group of international experts to 
      review relevant literature and provide recommendations. The procedure included an
      open online survey, several stages of text drafting and consultation by working
      groups and a 3-day consensus meeting in October 2019. This statement includes
      recommendations for data collection and research reporting covering key
      components: defining and classifying health problems; severity of health
      problems; capturing and reporting athlete exposure; expressing risk; burden of
      health problems; study population characteristics and data collection methods.
      Based on these, we also developed a new reporting guideline as a STROBE
      Extension—the STROBE Sports Injury and Illness Surveillance (STROBE-SIIS). The
      IOC encourages ongoing in- and out-of-competition surveillance programmes and
      studies to describe injury and illness trends and patterns, understand their
      causes and develop measures to protect the health of the athlete. Implementation 
      of the methods outlined in this statement will advance consistency in data
      collection and research reporting.

TI  - Genomic basis for RNA alterations in cancer.
PG  - 129-36
AB  - Transcript alterations often result from somatic changes in cancer genomes1.
      Various forms of RNA alterations have been described in cancer, including
      overexpression2, altered splicing3 and gene fusions4; however, it is difficult to
      attribute these to underlying genomic changes owing to heterogeneity among
      patients and tumour types, and the relatively small cohorts of patients for whom 
      samples have been analysed by both transcriptome and whole-genome sequencing.
      Here we present, to our knowledge, the most comprehensive catalogue of
      cancer-associated gene alterations to date, obtained by characterizing tumour
      transcriptomes from 1,188 donors of the Pan-Cancer Analysis of Whole Genomes
      (PCAWG) Consortium of the International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC) and The
      Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)5. Using matched whole-genome sequencing data, we
      associated several categories of RNA alterations with germline and somatic DNA
      alterations, and identified probable genetic mechanisms. Somatic copy-number
      alterations were the major drivers of variations in total gene and
      allele-specific expression. We identified 649 associations of somatic
      single-nucleotide variants with gene expression in cis, of which 68.4% involved
      associations with flanking non-coding regions of the gene. We found 1,900
      splicing alterations associated with somatic mutations, including the formation
      of exons within introns in proximity to Alu elements. In addition, 82% of gene
      fusions were associated with structural variants, including 75 of a new class,
      termed ‘bridged’ fusions, in which a third genomic location bridges two genes. We
      observed transcriptomic alteration signatures that differ between cancer types
      and have associations with variations in DNA mutational signatures. This
      compendium of RNA alterations in the genomic context provides a rich resource for
      identifying genes and mechanisms that are functionally implicated in cancer.

TI  - How Much Sugar is in My Drink? The Power of Visual Cues.
LID - 394
AB  - Despite widespread attempts to educate consumers about the dangers of sugar, as
      well as the advent of nutritional labeling, individuals still struggle to make
      educated decisions about the foods they eat, and/or to use the Nutrition Facts
      Panel. This study examined the effect of visual aids on judgments of sugar
      quantity in popular drinks, and choices. 261 volunteers at four different
      locations evaluated 11 common beverages. Key measures were estimates of sugar in 
      the drinks, nutrition knowledge, and desire to consume them. In the experimental 
      condition, participants viewed beverages along with test tubes filled with the
      total amount of sugar in each drink; the control condition had no sugar display. 
      Both groups were encouraged to examine the Nutrition Facts Panel when making
      their evaluations. Correlational analyses revealed that consumers exposed to the 
      visual aid overestimated sugar content and the length of time needed to exercise 
      to burn off the calories; they also had lower intentions to consume any of the
      beverages. Individuals asserting to use the Nutrition Facts Panel (NFP) in
      general were also less likely to admit using it in this particular study (r = −2,
      p = 0.001). This study suggests that a simple visual aid intervention affected
      judgments and choices towards curtailing sugar intake. This has implications for 
      labeling format implementation.

TI  - Injury Surveillance During Competitive Functional Fitness Racing Events.
PG  - 197-205
AB  - High-intensity functional training (HIFT) is an exercise training modality that
      has grown considerably in popularity over the last decade. More recently,
      competitive functional fitness racing events have emerged from HIFT, and aim to
      test athletes’ proficiency across a variety of movements, skills, and energy
      systems. Whilst the injury risk associated with HIFT has been shown to be low and
      comparable to other forms of recreational fitness activities, the injury risk
      associated with competitive functional fitness racing events is currently
      unknown. A prospective cohort design was used to record medical-attention
      injuries during two competitive functional fitness racing events, involving 1085 
      competitors. A total of 26 injuries were recorded over the two competitions,
      resulting in an injury incidence rate of 36 per 1000 competition hours (90%
      confidence limits [CL]: 26–50) and injury prevalence of 2.4% (90% CL: 1.6–3.2%). 
      The shoulder (n=4) and hand (n=4) were the most commonly injured body locations. 
      The incidence rate in male athletes was likely higher than female athletes (Rate 
      Ratio [RR]: 1.87, 90% CL: 0.95–3.69). The injury incidence rate associated with
      competitive functional fitness racing events is higher than for HIFT training
      activities, though the injury prevalence is relatively low in comparison to other
      sporting activities. Further research is required to understand the burden of
      these injuries, and identify appropriate injury prevention strategies for this
      emerging sport.

TI  - Investigating diagnostic sequencing techniques for CADASIL diagnosis.
LID - 2
AB  - Cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and
      leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL) is a cerebral small vessel disease caused by
      mutations in the NOTCH3 gene. Our laboratory has been undertaking genetic
      diagnostic testing for CADASIL since 1997. Work originally utilised Sanger
      sequencing methods targeting specific NOTCH3 exons. More recently,
      next-generation sequencing (NGS)-based technologies such as a targeted gene panel
      and whole exome sequencing (WES) have been used for improved genetic diagnostic
      testing. In this study, data from 680 patient samples was analysed for 764 tests 
      utilising 3 different sequencing technologies. Sanger sequencing was performed
      for 407 tests, a targeted NGS gene panel which includes NOTCH3 exonic regions
      accounted for 354 tests, and WES with targeted analysis was performed for 3
      tests. In total, 14.7% of patient samples (n = 100/680) were determined to have a
      mutation. Testing efficacy varied by method, with 10.8% (n = 44/407) of tests
      using Sanger sequencing able to identify mutations, with 15.8% (n = 56/354) of
      tests performed using the NGS custom panel successfully identifying mutations and
      a likely non-NOTCH3 pathogenic variant (n = 1/3) identified through WES. Further 
      analysis was then performed through stratification of the number of mutations
      detected at our facility based on the number of exons, level of pathogenicity and
      the classification of mutations as known or novel. A systematic review of NOTCH3 
      mutation testing data from 1997 to 2017 determined the diagnostic rate of
      pathogenic findings and found the NGS-customised panel increases our ability to
      identify disease-causing mutations in NOTCH3.

TI  - Why and where an HIV cure is needed and how it might be achieved.
PG  - 397-405
AB  - Despite considerable global investment, only 60% of people who live with HIV
      currently receive antiretroviral therapy. The sustainability of current
      programmes remains unknown and key incidence rates are declining only modestly.
      Given the complexities and expenses associated with lifelong medication,
      developing an effective curative intervention is now a global priority. Here we
      review why and where a cure is needed, and how it might be achieved. We argue for
      expanding these efforts from resource-rich regions to sub-Saharan Africa and
      elsewhere: for any intervention to have an effect, region-specific biological,
      therapeutic and implementation issues must be addressed.

TI  - Attentional capture by Pavlovian reward-signalling distractors in visual search
      persists when rewards are removed.
LID - e0226284
AB  - Existing research indicates that learning about the Pavlovian ‘signal value’ of
      stimuli can induce attentional biases: findings suggest that our attentional
      system prioritises detection of stimuli that have previously signalled
      availability of high reward. These findings potentially provide a human analogue 
      of sign-tracking behaviour previously reported in studies of non-human animals.
      Here we examine a visual search task that has been developed to demonstrate the
      Pavlovian influence of reward on attention, in which the critical
      reward-signalling stimuli are never explicit targets of search. This procedure
      has previously yielded robust effects of reward on attention; however it remains 
      unclear whether this pattern reflects a persistent and automatic bias in
      attentional capture based on prior experience of stimulus–reward pairings, or
      whether it results from participants strategically attending to reward-signalling
      distractors because they provide useful information about reward magnitude. To
      investigate this issue, in the current study participants initially completed a
      rewarded visual search task, in which colours of distractor stimuli signalled
      availability of high or low reward. Participants then completed a test phase in
      which rewards were no longer available, such that distractor colours no longer
      provided useful information on reward availability. Performance during the
      initial rewarded phase was impaired by the presence of a distractor signalling
      availability of high relative to low reward. Crucially, the magnitude of this
      reward-related distraction effect did not reduce in the subsequent unrewarded
      test phase. This suggests that participants’ experience of differences in reward 
      value signalled by distractor stimuli in this task can induce persistent biases
      in the extent to which these stimuli involuntarily capture attention, even when
      they are entirely task-irrelevant.

TI  - Transitions that Matter? Czechoslovakia’s Break up and Human Stature.
LID - 5050
AB  - Changes in a population’s average stature are virtuous pointers of wellbeing
      which are sensitive to improvements in psychosocial environments during
      childhood. A major structural change that could have altered an environment
      during childhood is the transition from communist to a liberal democracy, and,
      more specifically, the meltdown of the Soviet bloc provides for a quasi-natural
      experiment. This paper examines the trends in heights in the Czech Republic and
      Slovakia before and after the transition and the subsequent break-up of the
      Czechoslovakian federation. We find that one additional year of exposure to a
      liberal democracy while growing up is associated with an increasing population
      stature of 0.28 cm among Slovaks and 0.15 cm among Czechs. We only find changes
      in stature among men who are more sensitive to environmental stress, especially
      at the lower end of the current socio-economic status. Results are robust to
      alternative datasets and measures of democracy.

TI  - Human adaptation to invasive species: A conceptual framework based on a case
      study metasynthesis.
PG  - 1401-30
AB  - Species invasions are a major driver of ecological change, are very difficult to 
      control or reverse, and will increase with climate change and global trade.
      Invasion sciences consider how species in invaded environments adapt, but neither
      scientists nor policy makers consider human adaptation to invasive species and
      how this affects ecosystems and well-being. To address this, a framework
      conceptualising autochthonous human adaptation to invasions was developed based
      on the Human Adaptation to Biodiversity Change framework and a case study
      metasynthesis. Results show that adaptation occurs within different spheres of
      human activity and organisation at different social-ecological scales; responses 
      have feedbacks within and across these spheres. Adaptation to invasives and other
      drivers is a set of highly contextual, complex, non-linear responses that make up
      pathways pursued over time. Most invasive species management and adaptation
      occurs ‘from below,’ and policies and planned control efforts should support
      autochthonous adaptation, rather than undermining it.Electronic supplementary

TI  - Patient participation in research funding: an overview of when, why and how
      amongst Dutch health funds.
LID - 33
AB  - Background: Patient participation in decision-making on health-related research
      has gained ground. Nineteen Dutch health-related research-funding organisations
      (HFs) have taken up the challenge to include patients in their funding process. A
      ‘Patient participation (PP) advisory team’ was set-up, with HF-representatives
      and patient advocates, who together initiated this study. We provide an overview 
      of when, why, and how PP activities take place in HFs’ funding processes, share
      main challenges and identify possible solutions. Methods: A qualitative research 
      design was used. Data was gathered by questionnaires (n = 14) and semi-structured
      interviews (n = 18) with HF employees responsible for patient participation,
      followed by a workshop (n = 27) with involved employees of HFs and key players in
      PP from national patient organisations and research organisations. A descriptive 
      analysis was used for the questionnaire. A semi-directed content analysis was
      used for the interviews and the workshop. Results: Three stages can be identified
      in the funding process in which HFs carry out PP activities: (1) strategic
      decision-making about focus of research (e.g. shared research agendas); (2) call 
      for and receipt of research proposals (e.g. mandatory inclusion of letter of
      recommendation from patient organisation); (3) decision-making about the funding 
      of research proposals (e.g. patients reside in a patient panel to co-review
      research proposals). Main challenges identified to carry out PP activities
      include: how to accommodate diversity of the patient body (mainly encountered in 
      stage 1 and 3); to what extent should patients receive training to successfully
      participate (mainly encountered in stage 1 and 3); and who is responsible for
      patient-researcher dialogues (mainly encountered in stage 1 and 2). All nineteen 
      HFs agree that patients should be included in at least one stage of the funding
      process for health-related research. CONCLUSION: Further broadening and
      optimising patient involvement is still needed. The proposed solutions to the
      identified challenges could serve as inspiration for national and international
      research funding foundations that aim to structurally include patients in their
      funding process.

TI  - Development, progress and future prospects in cryobiotechnology of Lilium spp.
LID - 125
AB  - Lilium is one of the most popular flower crops worldwide, and some species are
      also used as vegetables and medicines. The availability of and easy access to
      diverse Lilium genetic resources are essential for plant genetic improvements.
      Cryopreservation is currently considered as an ideal means for the long-term
      preservation of plant germplasm. Over the last two decades, great efforts have
      been exerted in studies of Lilium cryopreservation and progress has been made in 
      the successful cryopreservation of pollen, seeds and shoot tips in Lilium. Genes 
      that exist in Lilium, including those that regulate flower shape, color and size,
      and that are resistant to cold stress and diseases caused by fungi and viruses,
      provide a rich source of valuable genetic resources for breeding programs to
      create novel cultivars required by the global floriculture and ornamental
      markets. Successful cryopreservation of Lilium spp. is a way to preserve these
      valuable genes. The present study provides updated and comprehensive information 
      about the development of techniques that have advanced Lilium cryopreservation.
      Further ideas are proposed to better direct future studies on Lilium
      cryobiotechnology.

TI  - Associations between the dopamine D4 receptor gene polymorphisms and personality 
      traits in elite athletes.
PG  - 365-72
AB  - Personality traits and temperament may affect sports performance. Previous
      studies suggest that dopamine may play an important role in behavior regulation
      and physical exercise performance. The aim of this study is to determine
      associations between dopamine D4 receptor gene (DRD4 Ex3) polymorphisms and
      personality traits (such as neuroticism, extraversion, openness, agreeability and
      conscientiousness) in elite combat athletes. A total of 302 physically active,
      unrelated, self-reported Caucasian participants were recruited for this study.
      The participants consisted of 200 elite male combat athletes and 102 healthy male
      participants (control group). For personality trait measurements, the NEO
      Five-Factor Personality Inventory (NEO-FFI) and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory
      questionnaires were used. For the genetic assays, blood was collected and all
      samples were genotyped using the real-time PCR method. A 2 x 3 factorial ANOVA
      revealed statistically significant differences on the Openness NEO Five Factor
      Inventory scale for both examined factors, i.e. sport status and genetics DTD4
      Ex3. Combat athletes achieved higher scores on the Conscientiousness NEO-FFI
      scale when compared to controls (7.18 vs 5.98). On the other hand, combat
      athletes scored lower on the Openness scale in comparison with control group
      (4.42 vs. 4.63). Subjects with the DRD4 Ex3 s/s genotype had lower results on the
      openness scale in comparison with participants with the DRD4 Ex3 s/1 genotype
      (4.01 vs. 4.57) and higher DRD4 Ex3 1/1 genotype (4,01 vs. 3,50). In conclusion, 
      we found an association between the dopamine D4 receptor gene in variable number 
      tandem repeat (VNTR) polymorphisms and athletic status for two NEO-FFI factors:
      Openness and Conscientiousness. The DRD4 exon 3 polymorphism may be associated
      with the selected personality traits in combat athletes, thereby modulating
      athletes’ predisposition to participate in high risk sports.

TI  - HIV-1 elite controllers: an immunovirological review and clinical perspectives.
PG  - 163-6
AB  - HIV type 1 (HIV-1) elite controllers (ECs) represent a rare group of individuals 
      with an ability to maintain an undetectable HIV-1 viral load overtime in the
      absence of previous antiretroviral therapy. The mechanisms associated with this
      paradigm remain not clearly defined. However, loss of virological control,
      morbidity and mortality persist in these individuals, such as progress to
      AIDS-defining conditions together with persistent high rate of immune activation.
      Further insight into potential therapeutic options is therefore warranted. In
      this review, we discuss recent data on the type of immune responses understood to
      be associated with chronic virological control, the potential for disease
      progression and therapeutic options in ECs.

TI  - Heat-induced hypervolemia: Does the mode of acclimation matter and what are the
      implications for performance at Tokyo 2020?
PG  - 129-48
AB  - Tokyo 2020 will likely be the most heat stressful Olympics to date, so
      preparation to mitigate the effects of humid heat will be essential for
      performance in several of the 33 sports. One key consideration is heat
      acclimation (HA); the repeated exposure to heat to elicit physiological and
      psychophysical adaptations that improve tolerance and exercise performance in the
      heat. Heat can be imposed in various ways, including exercise in the heat, hot
      water immersion, or passive exposure to hot air (e.g., sauna). The physical
      requirements of each sport will determine the impact that the heat has on
      performance, and the adaptations required from HA to mitigate these effects. This
      review focuses on one key adaptation, plasma volume expansion (PVE), and how the 
      mode of HA may affect the kinetics of adaptation. PVE constitutes a primary
      HA-mediated adaptation and contributes to functional adaptations (e.g., lower
      heart rate and increased heat loss capacity), which may be particularly important
      in athletes of “sub-elite” cardiorespiratory fitness (e.g., team sports),
      alongside athletes of prolonged endurance events. This review: i) highlights the 
      ability of exercise in the heat, hot-water immersion, and passive hot air to
      expand PV, providing the first quantitative assessment of the efficacy of
      different heating modes; ii) discusses how this may apply to athletes at Tokyo
      2020; and iii) provides recommendations regarding the protocol of HA and the
      prospect for achieving PVE (and the related outcomes).

TI  - ‘Embarrassing the State’: The ‘Ordinary’ Prisoner Rights Movement in Ireland,
      1972–6.
PG  - 388-410
AB  - This article explores the early years of the campaign for ‘ordinary’, not
      politically-aligned, prisoners’ rights in Ireland. It argues that this campaign
      has often been overshadowed by the activities of ‘political prisoners’, who only 
      constituted a small minority of prisoners in the period. The article follows the 
      development and changing tactics of the ordinary prisoners’ movement, through the
      rise and fall of the Prisoners’ Union (PU) (1972–3) and into the early years of
      the Prisoners’ Rights Organisation (PRO) (1973–6), which would become the
      longest-lasting and most vocal penal reform organisation in Ireland, until the
      formation of the Irish Penal Reform Trust in 1994. It argues that the movement
      constantly adapted its tactics to address emerging issues and opportunities.
      Ultimately, it contends that by 1976 the PRO was an increasingly legitimate voice
      in Ireland’s public discourse on prisons. It shows that, although the campaign
      did not achieve any major penal reforms in this period, it had a significant
      impact on public debates about prisons, prisoners’ mental health, the failures of
      the penal system, and prisoners’ entitlement to human rights.

TI  - Anthropometric, physiological characteristics and rugby-specific game skills
      discriminating Zimbabwean under-16 male adolescent rugby players by level of
      competition.
LID - e000576
AB  - Objectives: Despite growing popularity of adolescent rugby in Zimbabwean schools,
      little is known about qualities or skills of schoolboy rugby players and how they
      differ by competitive level. Therefore, the aim of the current study was to
      identify anthropometric, physiological characteristics and rugby-specific game
      skills capable of discriminating under-16 (U16) RU players across three
      proficiency levels. Methods: Following development of School Clinical Rugby
      Measure test battery, elite rugby players (n=41), subelite rugby players (n=30)
      and non-rugby players (n=29) were enrolled and tested for height, sitting height,
      body mass, skinfolds, speed, agility, upper and lower muscular strength and
      power, prolonged high-intensity intermittent running ability, tackling, passing
      and catching in a cross-sectional study. Results: Elite rugby players displayed
      significantly better scores for all physiological tests and game skills compared 
      with either subelite or non-rugby players, except for Sit-and-Reach, 20 m speed
      and L-run tests. However, only vertical jump (VJ) and Yo-Yo Intermittent Recovery
      Test Level 1 (Yo-Yo IRT L1) significantly improved with increasing competitive
      level. In addition, elite rugby players showed significantly better scores for
      tackling (p<0.001) and catching (p<0.001) compared with subelites. No statistical
      differences were observed across competitive levels for height (p=0.43), sum of
      seven skinfolds (p=0.26) and passing (p=0.27). Conclusion: Since VJ and Yo-Yo IRT
      L1 improved with increasing playing standard, these findings possibly highlight
      physiological attributes important in elite schoolboy rugby in Zimbabwe.
      Additionally, development and training of tackling and catching skills in U16
      schoolboy rugby is important since they are linked to higher playing standard.

TI  - Training Regimes and Recovery Monitoring Practices of Elite British Swimmers.
PG  - 577-85
AB  - Consistent prescriptions for event-specific training of swimmers are lacking,
      which points to likely differences in training practices and a potential gap
      between practice and scientific knowledge. This study aimed to analyze the
      distance-specific training load of elite swimmers, derive a consistent training
      sessions’ description and reflect on the current recommendations for training and
      recovery. The individual training regimes of 18 elite British swimmers were
      documented by surveying four swim and two strength and conditioning (S&C)
      coaches. The annual and weekly training load and content were compared between
      swimmers competing in sprint, middle and long-distance events. Thematic analysis 
      of the surveys was conducted to identify key codes and general dimensions and to 
      define a unified classification of the swimming and S&C training sessions. Weekly
      training loads and content of the swim (ƞ2 - effect size; p = 0.016, ƞ2 = 0.423) 
      and S&C (p = 0.028, ƞ2 = 0.38) sessions significantly differed between the
      groups. Long-distance swimmers swam significantly longer distances (mean ± SD;
      58.1 ± 10.2 km vs. 43.2 ± 5.3 km; p = 0.018) weekly but completed similar number 
      of S&C sessions compared to sprinters. The annual swimming load distribution of
      middle-distance specialists did not differ from that of long-distance swimmers
      but consisted of more S&C sessions per week (4.7 ± 0.5 vs. 2.3 ± 2.3; p = 0.04). 
      Sprinters and middle-distance swimmers swam similar distances per week and
      completed similar number of S&C sessions but with different proportional content.
      Whereas all coaches reported monitoring fatigue, only 51% indicated implementing 
      individualized recovery protocols. We propose a consistent terminology for the
      description of training sessions in elite swimming to facilitate good practice
      exchanges. While the training prescription of elite British swimmers conforms to 
      the scientific training principles, recommendations for recovery protocols to
      reduce the risk of injury and overtraining are warranted.Key points: Consistent
      terminology for the description of training sessions in elite swimming is
      warranted to facilitate good practice exchanges.The training prescription of
      elite British swimmers conforms to the scientific training principle of
      specificity based on their primary event distance classification.The training
      programs of elite swimmers should incorporate comprehensive load monitoring and
      fatigue assessment to minimize training time losses due to overtraining and
      reduce the risk of injury.

TI  - Genes and Elite Marathon Running Performance: A Systematic Review.
PG  - 559-68
AB  - Genetics has long been considered to associate with many exercise-related traits 
      and sport performance phenotypes. A genetic basis for elite international
      marathon running performance exists due to the heritability of endurance-related 
      traits. This has prompted a generation of genomic study to identify marathon
      success. The aim of this study was to systematically review the evidence of
      genes, and their polymorphisms, that may play a role in marathon running
      performance. A search strategy was implemented on systematic databases following 
      PRISMA guidelines. Studies were case-control, cohort or genome-wide association
      designs and provided data on the genotypes associated with elite marathon athlete
      status and/or marathon running performance. The search identified 241 studies,
      from which, 14 studies were deemed suitable for inclusion. A total of 160
      different polymorphisms in 27 genes were identified in 10,442 participants, of
      which 2,984 were marathon distance runners. The review identified a possible 16
      single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 14 genes associated with marathon
      running performance. While multiple genes and their polymorphisms have been
      associated with marathon running performance, predicting future marathon success 
      based on genomic data is premature due to the lack of replicated studies. There
      is limited replication of genotype-phenotype associations and there is possible
      publication bias, thus, further studies are required to strengthen our
      understanding of the genes involved in marathon running. Future research
      utilising genome-wide technologies in large cohorts is required to elucidate the 
      multiple genetic factors that govern complex endurance-related traits and the
      impact of epigenetics should be considered.Key points: Elite marathon running has
      a polygenic nature of complex endurance-related traits.There is limited
      replication of genotype-phenotype associations to currently determine the genes
      involved in marathon running.Genome-wide technologies in large cohorts are
      required to elucidate the multiple genetic factors that govern the complex
      endurance-related traits of marathon running and the impact of epigenetics should
      be considered.

TI  - An Analysis of Public-Private Partnerships and Sustainable Health Care Provision 
      in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.
LID - 1178632919859008
AB  - This study considers the issue of health care provision in Saudi Arabia, looking 
      in particular at the challenges for health care providers and ministry officials.
      Although the study concentrates on factors specific to Saudi Arabia, it also
      examines the problem from a broadly international perspective. In particular, the
      study explores the experience of health care modernisation in the United Kingdom 
      to conceptualise the practicality of fusing public services with market ideals.
      There is a pressing need to modernise the Saudi health care system with the
      economic burden on the state-funded Ministry of Health being an unsustainable
      means of providing health care in future. The solution resides partially in
      opening the public health care system to alternative sources of management and
      revenue. In particular, public-private partnerships will be considered as a
      viable means of funding health care in Saudi Arabia and for improving standards
      and the quality of care. This study concludes that, whereas the move towards a
      public-private partnership approach to health care provision has been touted as a
      precondition for modernisation and development, the precise fusion between
      government and non-government forces remains a source of conjecture. As a result,
      the study advocates caution when evaluating the benefits and pitfalls of
      partnerships between public and private actors.

TI  - Persistence of value-modulated attentional capture is associated with risky
      alcohol use.
LID - 100195
AB  - Background: This study examined how risky patterns of alcohol use might be
      related to the persistence of learned attentional capture during reversal of
      stimulus–reward contingencies. Methods: Participants were 122 healthy adults
      (mean age 21 years, 66% female) who completed an assessment including a visual
      search task to measure value-modulated attentional capture, with a reversal phase
      following a period of initial training. The assessment also included questions
      about alcohol use. Results: Overall, attentional capture was greater for
      distractors associated with high reward than for those associated with low
      reward, replicating previous findings of value-modulated attentional capture.
      When stimulus–reward contingencies were reversed, a higher persistence of learned
      attentional capture was associated with risky patterns of alcohol use.
      Conclusion: This result highlights how value-modulated attentional capture may
      persist and is associated with risky alcohol use in a non-clinical sample. Future
      research (potentially with clinical samples of heavy drinkers) aimed towards
      understanding the mechanisms that drive these reversal deficits, and their
      relation to other compulsive behaviours, may provide important insights into the 
      development and maintenance of addictive behaviours.

TI  - Moderating factors influence the relative age effect in Australian cricket.
LID - e6867
AB  - Background: The relative age effect is a commonly occurring phenomenon whereby
      there is a tendency for relatively older players to be over-represented during
      high level competitions. This effect is often seen to diminish as player’s age,
      however, there has been far less investigation on other potential moderating
      factors. Method: This study investigated the impact of the relative age effect,
      and potential moderating factors, within the talent selection process of
      Australian cricket. Relative age distribution of 2,415 male and female junior and
      senior state level cricket players, who played in the Junior National
      Championships or State competition (senior level) between 2011 and 2015, were
      analysed. Results: Players born in the first quartile of the cricket season were 
      significantly over-represented in both male Under-15, Under-17, Under-19 and
      female Under-15 and Under-18 levels. However, there was no significant difference
      at the senior state level for either male or female cricketers. Further
      investigation of the relative age effect in the junior talent pathway revealed
      that male all-rounders, batters and pace bowlers, and female all-rounders and
      batters, born in first quartile were over-represented. Right-handed batters and
      bowlers were also influenced by the relative age effect at all Junior National
      levels, while left-handed batters and bowlers were only influenced at the
      Under-15 and Under-17 levels. These results highlight the impact relative age has
      on junior cricket talent pathways, including sex, age, handedness and primary
      skills. Only state level, and left-handedness at the Under-19 level, were
      unaffected by relative age. Discussion: The findings of this study highlight the 
      influence of relative age effects for both male and female junior cricket
      players. Interestingly, there may be an advantage to being left-handed that is
      more prevalent at the older (male Under-19; female Under-18) age levels.

TI  - Effects of Cycling on Subsequent Running Performance, Stride Length, and Muscle
      Oxygen Saturation in Triathletes.
LID - 115
AB  - Running performance is a determinant factor for victory in Sprint and Olympic
      distance triathlon. Previous cycling may impair running performance in
      triathlons, so brick training becomes an important part of training. Wearable
      technology that is used by triathletes can offer several metrics for optimising
      training in real-time. The aim of this study was to analyse the effect of
      previous cycling on subsequent running performance in a field test, while using
      kinematics metrics and SmO2 provided by wearable devices that are potentially
      used by triathletes. Ten trained triathletes participated in a randomised
      crossover study, performing two trial sessions that were separated by seven days:
      the isolated run trial (IRT) and the bike-run trial (BRT). Running kinematics,
      physiological outcomes, and perceptual parameters were assessed before and after 
      each running test. The running distance was significantly lower in the BRT when
      compared to the IRT, with a decrease in stride length of 0.1 m (p = 0.00) and
      higher %SmO2 (p = 0.00) in spite of the maximal intensity of exercise. No effects
      were reported in vertical oscillation, ground contact time, running cadence, and 
      average heart rate. These findings may only be relevant to ‘moderate level’
      triathletes, but not to ‘elite’ ones. Triathletes might monitor their %SmO2 and
      stride length during brick training and then compare it with isolated running to 
      evaluate performance changes. Using wearable technology (near-infrared
      spectroscopy, accelerometry) for specific brick training may be a good option for
      triathletes.

TI  - Recommendations for Measurement and Management of an Elite Athlete.
LID - 105
AB  - Athletes who merit the title ‘elite’ are rare and differ both quantitatively and 
      qualitatively from athletes of lower qualifications. Serving and studying elite
      athletes may demand non-traditional approaches. Research involving elite athletes
      suffers because of the typical nomothetic requirements for large sample sizes and
      other statistical assumptions that do not apply to this population. Ideographic
      research uses single-athlete study designs, trend analyses, and statistical
      process control. Single-athlete designs seek to measure differences in repeated
      measurements under prescribed conditions, and trend analyses may permit
      systematic monitoring and prediction of future outcomes. Statistical process
      control uses control charting and other methods from management systems to assess
      and modify training processes in near real-time. These methods bring assessment
      and process control into the real world of elite athletics.

TI  - Disabled people’s organisations and the disability movement: Perspectives from
      Burkina Faso.
LID - 500
AB  - Background: In Burkina Faso, the disability movement is rather weak, both in
      terms of funding and staffing – its range does not extend far outside the capital
      city and is largely dependent on international non-governmental organisations
      (INGOs). Despite the huge number of grassroots disabled people’s organisations
      (DPOs), many of these organisations do not function beyond the occasional meeting
      and celebration of the International Day of Persons with Disabilities. The
      reasons for this are various, including dependency on external funding (such as
      from international organisations), lack of access to resources, being dependent
      on voluntary members, and lack of organisation. Objectives: This article looks at
      the functioning of – and politics governing – DPOs in Burkina Faso, their
      significance in the lives of people with disabilities and the challenges they
      encounter. Method: This article is based on research findings obtained through
      interviews conducted with people with disabilities, as well as INGOs working with
      people with disabilities and state authorities in Burkina Faso. Results: Evidence
      suggests that the farther people with disabilities are from the capital, the
      lesser are their chances of being heard and of being involved in decision-making.
      However, DPOs offer a haven for many, offering people with disabilities solace in
      meeting other members and finding a sense of belonging in these associations.
      Others give importance to the role of DPOs in raising awareness and human rights 
      advocacy. Conclusion: Finally, the article raises the question as to what the
      future of DPOs in Burkina Faso might entail. Keywords: Burkina Faso; disability
      identity; disability movement; disabled people’s organisations; income-generating
      activities; international non-governmental organisations; socialisation; vie
      associative; voluntary organisations; urban–rural divide.

LID - e0216128
AB  - Evidence suggests that women in academia are hindered by conscious and
      unconscious biases, and often feel excluded from formal and informal
      opportunities for research collaboration. In addition to ensuring fairness and
      helping to redress gender imbalance in the academic workforce, increasing women’s
      access to collaboration could help scientific progress by drawing on more of the 
      available human capital. Here, we test whether researchers tend to collaborate
      with same-gendered colleagues, using more stringent methods and a larger dataset 
      than in past work. Our results reaffirm that researchers co-publish with
      colleagues of the same gender more often than expected by chance, and show that
      this ‘gender homophily’ is slightly stronger today than it was 10 years ago.
      Contrary to our expectations, we found no evidence that homophily is driven
      mostly by senior academics, and no evidence that homophily is stronger in fields 
      where women are in the minority. Interestingly, journals with a high impact
      factor for their discipline tended to have comparatively low homophily, as
      predicted if mixed-gender teams produce better research. We discuss some
      potential causes of gender homophily in science.

TI  - Assessment of Cas12a‐mediated gene editing efficiency in plants.
PG  - 1971-84
AB  - The CRISPR/Cas12a editing system opens new possibilities for plant genome
      engineering. To obtain a comparative assessment of RNA‐guided endonuclease (RGEN)
      types in plants, we adapted the CRISPR/Cas12a system to the GoldenBraid (GB)
      modular cloning platform and compared the efficiency of Acidaminococcus (As) and 
      Lachnospiraceae (Lb) Cas12a variants with the previously described GB‐assembled
      Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9 (SpCas9) constructs in eight Nicotiana benthamiana
      loci using transient expression. All three nucleases showed drastic
      target‐dependent differences in efficiency, with LbCas12 producing higher
      mutagenesis rates in five of the eight loci assayed, as estimated with the T7E1
      endonuclease assay. Attempts to engineer crRNA direct repeat (DR) had little
      effect improving on‐target efficiency for AsCas12a and resulted deleterious in
      the case of LbCas12a. To complete the assessment of Cas12a activity, we carried
      out genome editing experiments in three different model plants, namely
      N. benthamiana, Solanum lycopersicum and Arabidopsis thaliana. For the latter, we
      also resequenced Cas12a‐free segregating T2 lines to assess possible off‐target
      effects. Our results showed that the mutagenesis footprint of Cas12a is enriched 
      in deletions of −10 to −2 nucleotides and included in some instances complex
      rearrangements in the surroundings of the target sites. We found no evidence of
      off‐target mutations neither in related sequences nor somewhere else in the
      genome. Collectively, this study shows that LbCas12a is a viable alternative to
      SpCas9 for plant genome engineering.

TI  - Emotions in Group Sports: A Narrative Review From a Social Identity Perspective.
LID - 666
AB  - Recently, novel lines of research have developed to study the influence of
      identity processes in sport-related behaviors. Yet, whereas emotions in sport are
      the result of a complex psychosocial process, little attention has been paid to
      examining the mechanisms that underlie how group membership influences athletes’ 
      emotional experiences. The present narrative review aims at complementing the
      comprehensive review produced by Rees et al. (2015) on social identity in sport
      by reporting specific work on identity-based emotions in sport. To that end, we
      firstly overview the different terminology currently used in the field of
      emotions in groups to clarify the distinct nature of emotions that result from an
      individual’s social identity. Secondly, we discuss key concepts of social
      identity to better understand the mechanisms underlying identity-based emotions. 
      Thirdly, we address existing knowledge on identity-based emotions in sport. We
      close the present narrative review by suggesting future research perspectives
      based on existing meta-theories of social identity. Evidence from the social
      psychology literature is discussed alongside existing works from the sport
      literature to propose a crucial theoretical approach to better understand
      emotions in sport.

TI  - The Role of Mineral and Trace Element Supplementation in Exercise and Athletic
      Performance: A Systematic Review.
LID - 696
AB  - Minerals and trace elements (MTEs) are micronutrients involved in hundreds of
      biological processes. Deficiency in MTEs can negatively affect athletic
      performance. Approximately 50% of athletes have reported consuming some form of
      micronutrient supplement; however, there is limited data confirming their
      efficacy for improving performance. The aim of this study was to systematically
      review the role of MTEs in exercise and athletic performance. Six electronic
      databases and grey literature sources (MEDLINE; EMBASE; CINAHL and SportDISCUS;
      Web of Science and clinicaltrials.gov) were searched, in accordance with PRISMA
      guidelines. Results: 17,433 articles were identified and 130 experiments from 128
      studies were included. Retrieved articles included Iron (n = 29), Calcium (n =
      11), Magnesium, (n = 22), Phosphate (n = 17), Zinc (n = 9), Sodium (n = 15),
      Boron (n = 4), Selenium (n = 5), Chromium (n = 12) and multi-mineral articles (n 
      = 5). No relevant articles were identified for Copper, Manganese, Iodine, Nickel,
      Fluoride or Cobalt. Only Iron and Magnesium included articles of sufficient
      quality to be assigned as ‘strong’. Currently, there is little evidence to
      support the use of MTE supplementation to improve physiological markers of
      athletic performance, with the possible exception of Iron (in particular,
      biological situations) and Magnesium as these currently have the strongest
      quality evidence. Regardless, some MTEs may possess the potential to improve
      athletic performance, but more high quality research is required before support
      for these MTEs can be given. PROSPERO preregistered (CRD42018090502).

TI  - Injury Surveillance during a European Touch Rugby Championship.
LID - 71
AB  - Background: Touch (rugby/football) is a minimal contact sport for which the type 
      and incidence of injuries remains unknown in Europe. Objectives: To establish the
      incidence, severity and nature of injuries sustained during a four-day European
      Touch Championship competition. Methods: A prospective cohort design was adopted 
      to record match-related injuries during the European Touch Championships 2016.
      Injuries were collected from five countries and classified using the Orchard
      Sports Injury Classification (OSICS-10). Data were combined from all
      participating countries and injury incidence was recorded as number of
      injuries/1000 player hours. Results: A total of 135 injuries were recorded during
      the tournament with injury incidence calculated as 103.5 injuries per 1000 player
      match hours. Injuries were mainly recorded as transient (76%) occurring most
      frequently in the lower limb (69%). Injuries occurred more frequently on
      successive days, with exception to the final day of the tournament. The number of
      injuries was not different between the first and second half of matches and there
      was no relationship between the day of the tournament and the half of the match
      that injury occurred. Conclusion: Match injury incidence was 103.5 injuries per
      100 player match hours. The most injured site was that of the lower limb, with
      the most common injury type reported as muscle/tendon injury. It is postulated
      that fatigue plays a role in injury incidence during a multiday tournament.

TI  - Infant-feeding practices and infant survival by familial wealth in London,
      1752–1812.
PG  - 174-206
AB  - Anecdotal evidence indicates that high-status women in England generally did not 
      breastfeed their children in the seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries.
      Metropolitan families of varied social status also often sent their children out 
      of London for wet-nursing. However, anecdotal sources and rural burial registers 
      also suggest that these practices declined rapidly from the mid-eighteenth
      century, and were replaced by a culture of maternal breastfeeding in all social
      classes. These changes in infant-feeding practices have been argued to explain
      much of the dramatic improvement in infant mortality rates in London in this
      period. Here we used quantitative evidence from a partial family reconstitution
      of the London parish of St. Martin in the Fields to test these claims. Using
      birth interval analysis to infer breastfeeding patterns in families by four
      categories of wealth, we found that birth intervals were close to the national
      average in pauper and poor families, but much shorter in wealthier families, in
      the period 1752–74. We also found evidence that many infants especially in
      wealthier families were missing from observation, consistent with high levels of 
      rural wet-nursing. Both these phenomena declined between 1775 and 1812,
      suggesting a convergence in breastfeeding practices to the national norm. We used
      event history analysis, with corrections to aggregate rates for missing infants, 
      to compare mortality rates over time and by wealth category. We found that infant
      mortality was initially higher in wealthier families, but declined in all groups 
      over the period 1752–1812. We conclude that increases in maternal breastfeeding
      were probably important in improving survival of infants from wealthier families,
      however changes in breastfeeding patterns were insufficient to account for the
      ubiquitous improvements in mortality of urban-born infants in this period.

TI  - “For how long are we going to take the tablets?” Kenyan stakeholders’ views on
      priority investments to tackle Soil-transmitted Helminths illuminate
      aid-dependency and sustainability.
PG  - 51-9
AB  - Recent global commitments to shift responsibility for Neglected Tropical Disease 
      (NTD) control to affected countries reflect a renewed emphasis on sustainability,
      away from aid-dependency. This calls for a better understanding of how domestic
      stakeholders perceive investments in different strategies for NTD control. Soil
      transmitted helminths (STH) are among the NTDs targeted for elimination as a
      public health problem by international agencies through mass drug administration,
      provided periodically to at-risk population groups, often using drugs donated by 
      pharmaceutical companies. This study was conducted in Kenya at a time when
      responsibilities for long running STH programmes were transitioning from external
      to national and sub-national agencies. Following an initial assessment in which
      we identified key domestic stakeholders and reviewed relevant scientific and
      government documents, the perspectives of stakeholders working in health,
      education, community engagement and sanitation were investigated through
      semi-structured interviews with national level policymakers, county level
      policymakers, and frontline implementers in one high-STH burden county, Kwale.
      Our conceptual framework on sustainability traced a progression in thinking, from
      ensuring financial stability through the technical ability to adapt to changing
      circumstances, and ultimately to a situation where a programme is prioritised by 
      domestic policymakers because empowered communities demand it. It was clear from 
      our interviews that most Kenyan stakeholders sought to be at the final stage in
      this progression. Interviewees criticised long-term investment in mass drug
      administration, the approach favoured predominantly by external agencies, for
      failing to address underlying causes of STH. Instead they identified three
      synergistic priority areas for investment: changes in institutional structures
      and culture to reduce working in silos; building community demand for and
      ownership; and increased policymaker engagement on underlying socioeconomic and
      environmental causes of STH. Although challenging to implement, the shift in
      responsibility from external agencies to domestic stakeholders may lead to
      emergence of new strategic directions.

TI  - Populism and feminist politics: The cases of Finland and Spain.
PG  - 1108-28
AB  - While populism has been subject to growing scholarly interest, its relationship
      to feminist politics has remained conspicuously understudied. This article
      investigates this relationship by analysing two cases of European populism: left 
      populism in Spain (Podemos), and right populism in Finland (the Finns Party). The
      questions asked, and the challenges posed to feminist politics from populist
      political forces are intriguing: How is feminist politics articulated in both
      left and right populism? What differences can be discerned between left and right
      populism for feminist politics? To explore this, the article analyses three core 
      dimensions: (1) political representation: descriptive representation (numbers of 
      women, men and minority positions) and substantive representation (policy content
      in relation to gender equality); (2) populist parties’ formal and informal gender
      institutions such as internal quotas, gender equality plans and institutional
      culture; and (3) dedicated spaces for feminist politics such as women's sections 
      or feminist groups. It is argued that political ideology matters for feminist
      politics, and while left parties are more responsive to feminist concerns and
      populism poses specific problems for feminist politics, it is the gendered
      culture of political parties that ensures both left and right parties are
      problematic for feminist politics.

TI  - Changes in Splenic Volume After the Treadmill Exercise at Specific Workloads in
      Elite Long-Distance Runners and Recreational Runners.
PG  - 32-4
AB  - Introduction:: Spleen acts as blood reservoir both in animals and human beings.
      Spleen contracts during the exercise and so augment the systemic circulation and 
      helps body to maintain longer on high intensity exercise. Reviewing all available
      literature, the human spleen shows a decrease in volume, in range from 8% to 56%,
      depending on the work intensity. Aim:: To evaluate the percentage of the decrease
      in splenic volume after the treadmill exercise at specific workloads: aerobic
      threshold intensity, anaerobic threshold intensity, submaximal intensity and
      maximal intensity. Methods:: This prospective study with repeated measurements
      included 16 healthy subjects, divided in two groups. First group consisted of 8
      elite long-distance runners and second group of 8 recreational runners. First
      testing consisted of treadmill ergospirometry test. This data was crucial for the
      second testing where subjects were exercising on treadmill at specific workloads.
      Four specific workloads were determined: treadmill exercise at aerobic threshold 
      intensity (1st workload), anaerobic threshold intensity (2nd workload),
      submaximal intensity (3rd workload) and maximal intensity (4th workload).
      Workloads were controlled by the speed of treadmill, for each subject
      individually regarding the ergospirometry test. Ultrasound measurement of spleen 
      was done before and after each workload. Results:: Elite long-distance runners
      showed greater spleen contraction than recreational runners after four workloads.
      Spleen contraction was the biggest after the 3rd workload in elite long-distance 
      runners. Smallest contraction was in group of recreational runners after the 1st 
      workload. Statistically significant difference was not found between the groups, 
      regarding the splenic volume after exercise at four specific workloads (p>0.05). 
      Conclusion:: Elite long-distance runners had greater decrease in splenic volume
      than recreational runners, after exercise at four specific workloads, without
      significant difference. Greatest decrease happened in elite long-distance
      runners, after exercise at submaximal intensity - 49% decrease in splenic volume.

TI  - The democratization of scientific publishing.
LID - 12
AB  - Where should I submit my paper? This is a question that young scientists and
      trainees frequently ask. In this Commentary, we advise on how to make such a
      decision whilst balancing the risks and benefits. We argue that trying to publish
      in top tier journals may not always be the best option and that publishing in
      indexed, open access journals may expose research to the same or larger
      audiences. The value of research should not be judged according to the publishing
      journal’s name, but rather from other measures of impact such as successful
      commercialization of new technologies, number of citations, and downloads. We
      also highlight the role of mentors, who have the responsibility to protect the
      long-term interests of their trainees by balancing the consequences of
      acceptances and rejections.

TI  - When are anti‐fat attitudes understood as prejudice versus truth? An experimental
      study of social influence effects.
PG  - 28-35
AB  - Background/Objectives: If people who hold anti‐fat attitudes believe these
      attitudes to be true, then anti‐prejudice appeals are likely to be unsuccessful, 
      if only because the targets will not see their attitudes as in need of change.
      The current study examined processes that may lead people to see their anti‐fat
      attitudes as ‘truth’ or as ‘prejudice’. Subjects/Methods: Participants (N = 482) 
      read anti‐fat statements and were then presented with an interpretation of these 
      statements as ‘truth’ or ‘prejudice’. The source of this interpretation was
      either an (i) in‐group or out‐group member and (ii) expert or non‐expert.
      Participants' judgements of the statements were expected to vary such that
      in‐group others and experts would exert more influence than would out‐group
      others and non‐experts. Results: Participants aligned their own interpretations
      of an anti‐fat statement with those of an expert, but not with those of a
      non‐expert, F(1,466) = 8.97, p < 0.05, ηp2 = 0.02. The group membership variable 
      had no effect on judgements of ‘truth’ or ‘prejudice’ of the anti‐fat statement. 
      Conclusion: The expressions that people believe constitute anti‐fat prejudice
      versus truth about people described as overweight are influenced by exposure to
      expert opinion (in this case, by medical doctors). Implications for the success
      of weight‐based anti‐prejudice appeals and for healthcare provision are
      discussed.

TI  - Natural control of HIV infection in young women in South Africa: HPTN 068.
PG  - 202-8
AB  - Background:: Some individuals control HIV replication without antiretroviral
      (ARV) therapy. Objective:: To analyze viral suppression in young women in rural
      South Africa enrolled in a trial evaluating a behavioral intervention for HIV
      prevention. Methods:: Plasma samples were obtained from women ages 13–24 (81
      infected at enrollment, 164 seroconverters). ARV testing was performed using an
      assay that detects 20 ARV drugs. Women were classified as viremic controllers if 
      they were virally suppressed for ≥12 months with no ARV drug use. Results::
      Samples from 216/245 (88.2%) women had no ARV drugs detected at their first
      HIV-positive visit. Thirty-four (15.7%) of the 216 women had a viral load <2,000 
      copies/mL. Fifteen of the 34 women were followed for ≥12 months; 12 were virally 
      suppressed with no ARV drugs detected during follow-up. These women were
      classified as viremic controllers (overall: 12/216=5.6%). The median CD4 cell
      count at the first HIV-positive visit was higher among the 12 controllers than
      among the 204 women who were not using ARV drugs (759 vs. 549 cells/mm3, p=0.02).
      Some women had a viral load <40 copies/mL at a single study visit, but none were 
      classified as elite controllers (viral load <40 copies/mL for ≥12 months with no 
      ARV drug use). Conclusions:: In this cohort, 5.6% of women who were not using ARV
      drugs had sustained viral suppression. This represents a minimum estimate of the 
      frequency of viremic controllers in this cohort, since some women were not
      followed long enough to meet the criteria for classification.

TI  - An improved micropropagation and ex vitro rooting of a commercially important
      crop Henna (Lawsonia inermis L.).
PG  - 1273-84
AB  - An improved micropropagation protocol has been developed for a cosmetically
      important, dye yielding crop, henna (Lawsonia inermis). Quality of henna product 
      is governed by naphthoquinone based pigment lawsone, thus in vitro multiplication
      of superior healthy plant to achieve enhanced productivity in terms of dye
      content and biomass deserve due attention. In the present study, nodal explants
      collected from an elite plant screened on the basis of superiority in lawsone
      content was cultured on MS medium supplemented with 0.5 μM benzyl adenine (BA)
      gave significantly (p < 0.05) high number of shoots (24.33). The explants placed 
      on MS medium augmented with 0.5 μM BA and 2-isopentenyladenine (2-iP) resulted in
      the formation of maximum number of shoots (43.67) and was elongated (12.57 cm)
      within 4 weeks of culture period. Enhanced axillary bud proliferation and
      production of mass number of micro shoots was achieved by the continuous
      subculture in MS medium containing 0.5 μM BA and 2-iP. In vitro raised micro
      shoots were dipped in 0.44 mM NAA for 5 min followed by planting in polyethylene 
      pots containing a soil: vermiculite (1:1 v/v) mixture produced rooted plantlets
      (100%). Different auxin types and its concentrations had significant role rooting
      of L. inermis. Rooting response of various size shoots of L. inermis treated with
      0.44 mM NAA showed 100% rooting in 4.1–5 cm size class shoots. After two months
      of potting, survived (95%) plants were successfully transferred to medicinal
      plant garden of the Department. The lawsone content of one-year-old
      micropropagated plants (23.04 mg/g dw) growing in normal environmental conditions
      and elite mother plant (22.84 mg/g dw) was almost similar. Through the present
      study, efficient cloning of superior germplasm of L. inermis was established.

TI  - Policing the profession? Regulatory reform, restratification and the emergence of
      Responsible Officers as a new locus of power in UK medicine.
PG  - 98-105
AB  - Doctors' work and the changing, contested meanings of medical professionalism
      have long been a focus for sociological research. Much recent attention has
      focused on those doctors working at the interface between healthcare management
      and medical practice, with such ‘hybrid’ doctor-managers providing valuable
      analytical material for exploring changes in how medical professionalism is
      understood. In the United Kingdom, significant structural changes to medical
      regulation, most notably the introduction of revalidation in 2012, have created a
      new hybrid group, Responsible Officers (ROs), responsible for making periodic
      recommendations about the on-going fitness to practise medicine of all other
      doctors in their organisation.Using qualitative data collected in a 2015 survey
      with 374 respondents, 63% of ROs in the UK, this paper analyses the RO role. Our 
      findings show ROs to be a distinct emergent group of hybrid professionals and as 
      such demonstrate restructuring within UK medicine. Occupying a position where
      multiple agendas converge, ROs' work expands professional regulation into the
      organisational sphere in new ways, as well as creating new lines of continuous
      accountability between the wider profession and the General Medical Council as
      medical regulator. Our exploration of ROs' approaches to their work offers new
      insights into the on-going development of medical professionalism, pointing to
      the emergence of a distinctly regulatory hybrid professionalism shaped by
      co-existing professional, managerial and regulatory logics, in an era of
      strengthened governance and complex policy change.

TI  - The Role of Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance in Sports Cardiology; Current
      Utility and Future Perspectives.
LID - 86
AB  - Purpose of review: Cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) is frequently used in 
      the investigation of suspected cardiac disease in athletes. In this review, we
      discuss how CMR can be used in athletes with suspected cardiomyopathy with
      particular reference to volumetric analysis and tissue characterization. We also 
      discuss the finding of non-ischaemic fibrosis in athletes describing its
      prevalence, distribution and clinical importance. Recent findings: The strengths 
      of CMR include high spatial resolution, unrestricted imaging planes and lack of
      ionizing radiation. Regular physical exercise leads to cardiac remodeling that in
      certain situations can be clinically challenging to differentiate from various
      cardiomyopathies. Thorough morphological assessment by CMR is fundamental to
      ensuring accurate diagnosis. Developments in tissue characterization by late
      gadolinium enhancement and T1 mapping have the potential to be powerful
      additional tools in this challenging clinical situation. Using late gadolinium
      enhancement, it is also possible to detect non-ischaemic fibrosis in athletes who
      do not have overt cardiomyopathy. The mechanisms of this fibrosis are unclear;
      however, it does appear to be clinically important. We also review data on the
      prevalence of non-ischaemic fibrosis in athletes. Summary: CMR is a powerful tool
      to aid in the diagnosis of cardiomyopathy in athletes. It may also have a future 
      role in assessing fibrosis related to long-term participation in sport.

TI  - Using public opinion to serve journalistic narratives: Rethinking vox pops and
      live two-way reporting in five UK election campaigns (2009–2017).
PG  - 639-56
AB  - The news media are often accused of reporting politics in a too narrow and
      consensual way, excluding certain perspectives and issues that might better
      reflect the public’s agenda. This study lends weight to this argument by not only
      demonstrating the party political focus of UK election coverage but also in the
      misleading way public opinion was, at times, represented. Analysing 6647 items
      and/or stories in the largest ever content analysis study of 4613 sources across 
      five first- and second-order election campaigns in the United Kingdom, it
      comprehensively tracks how citizens and journalists appear in television news, as
      well as developing a finely grained, qualitative assessment of how public opinion
      was represented during the 2017 election campaign. Overall, the study found that 
      political parties received the most amount of airtime, but in some election
      campaigns members of the public appeared in coverage more often than politicians.
      However, they were mostly granted limited airtime to articulate their views in
      vox pops. During the 2017 election campaign, the study found the editorial
      construction of public opinion in vox pops and live journalistic two-ways was
      shaped by a relatively narrow set of assumptions made by political journalists
      about the public’s ideological views rather than consulting more objective
      measures of public opinion. So, for example, voters were portrayed as favouring
      more right- than left-wing policies despite evidence to the contrary. The use of 
      citizens as sources is theorised as serving the pre-conceived narratives of
      journalists rather than reflecting a representative picture of public opinion.
      The study reinforces and advances academic debates about journalists and
      citizen-source interactions. More accurately engaging with people’s concerns, it 
      is concluded, will help move broadcasters beyond the narrow set of assumptions
      that typically serve their narratives of political coverage.

TI  - Lack of Virological Suppression among Young HIV-Positive Adults in Botswana.
PG  - 557-65
AB  - Background:: HIV-1 RNA load is the best biological predictor of HIV transmission 
      and treatment response. The rate of virologic suppression among key
      sub-populations can guide HIV prevention programs. Methods:: The Botswana
      Combination Prevention Project performed a population-based household survey
      among adults in 30 communities in Botswana. Data collected included knowledge of 
      HIV-positive status, ART coverage and virologic suppression (HIV-1 RNA ≤400
      copies/mL). Individuals aged 16–29 years were considered young adults. Results:: 
      Among 552 young people living with HIV (PLHIV) enrolled with RNA load data and
      ART status available, 51% (n=279) had undetectable HIV-1 RNA, including 54% of
      young women and 32% of young men (gender PR: 0.53; 95% CI: 0.43–0.80; p<0.001).
      Compared with older adults (30–64 years old), young HIV-infected adults were
      significantly less likely to have undetectable HIV-1 RNA (PR: 0.65; 95%CI:
      0.59–0.70; p<0.0001), including both men (PR: 0.43; 95%CI: 0.34–0.56; p<0.0001)
      and women (PR: 0.67; 95%CI: 0.62–0.74; p<0.0001). Among a subset of PLHIV
      receiving ART, young adults also were less likely to have undetectable HIV-1 RNA 
      load than older adults (PR: 0.93; 95%CI: 0.90–0.95; p=<0.0001). Analysis of the
      care continuum revealed that inferior HIV diagnosis and sub-optimal linkage to
      care are the primary reasons for low virologic suppression among young adults.
      Conclusions:: Young adults in Botswana are significantly less likely to have
      undetectable HIV-1 RNA load compared with older adults. In the era of broad
      scale-up of ART, interventions able to diagnose young adults living with HIV and 
      link them to effective therapy are urgently needed.

TI  - Computational modelling reveals distinct patterns of cognitive and physical
      motivation in elite athletes.
LID - 11888
AB  - Effort can be perceived both cognitively and physically, but the computational
      mechanisms underlying the motivation to invest effort in each domain remain
      unclear. In particular, it is unknown whether intensive physical training is
      associated with higher motivation specific to that domain, or whether it is
      accompanied by corresponding changes in cognitive motivation. Here, we tested a
      group of elite Oxford University rowers, and compared their behaviour to matched 
      non-athletic controls. We trained participants on two tasks involving cognitive
      or physical effort. They then decided between a baseline low level of effort for 
      low reward, versus higher levels of effort for higher rewards. Separate choices
      were made for the cognitive and physical tasks, which allowed us to
      computationally model motivation in each domain independently. As expected,
      athletes were willing to exert greater amounts of physical effort than
      non-athletes. Critically, however, the nature of cognitive effort-based decisions
      was different between groups, with a concave pattern of effort discounting for
      athletes but a convex pattern for non-athletes. These data suggest that the
      greater physical drive in athletes is accompanied by fundamentally different
      patterns of cognitive effort discounting, and suggests a complex relationship
      between motivation in the two domains.

TI  - Experimentally induced social threat increases paranoid thinking.
LID - 180569
AB  - The ability to attribute intentions to others is a hallmark of human social
      cognition but is altered in paranoia. Paranoia is the most common positive
      symptom of psychosis but is also present to varying degrees in the general
      population. Epidemiological models suggest that psychosis risk is associated with
      low social rank and minority status, but the causal effects of status and group
      affiliation on paranoid thinking remain unclear. We examined whether relative
      social status and perceived group affiliation, respectively, affect live paranoid
      thinking using two large-N (N = 2030), pre-registered experiments. Interacting
      with someone from a higher social rank or a political out-group led to an
      increase in paranoid attributions of harmful intent for ambiguous actions.
      Pre-existing paranoia predicted a general increase in harmful intent attribution,
      but there was no interaction with either type of social threat: highly paranoid
      people showed the same magnitude of increase as non-paranoid people, although
      from a higher baseline. We conclude social threat in the form of low social
      status and out-group status affects paranoid attributions, but ongoing paranoia
      represents a lowered threshold for detecting social threat rather than an
      impaired reactivity to it.

LID - e34202
AB  - Regulation of protein turnover allows cells to react to their environment and
      maintain homeostasis. Proteins can show different turnover rates in different
      tissue, but little is known about protein turnover in different brain cell types.
      We used dynamic SILAC to determine half-lives of over 5100 proteins in rat
      primary hippocampal cultures as well as in neuron-enriched and glia-enriched
      cultures ranging from <1 to >20 days. In contrast to synaptic proteins, membrane 
      proteins were relatively shorter-lived and mitochondrial proteins were
      longer-lived compared to the population. Half-lives also correlate with protein
      functions and the dynamics of the complexes they are incorporated in. Proteins in
      glia possessed shorter half-lives than the same proteins in neurons. The presence
      of glia sped up or slowed down the turnover of neuronal proteins. Our results
      demonstrate that both the cell-type of origin as well as the nature of the
      extracellular environment have potent influences on protein turnover.

TI  - High Plasma Levels of sTNF-R1 and CCL11 Are Related to CD4+ T-Cells Fall in Human
      Immunodeficiency Virus Elite Controllers With a Sustained Virologic Control.
LID - 1399
AB  - Our aim was to analyze the relationship between plasma inflammatory biomarkers
      and CD4+ T-cells evolution in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) elite
      controllers (HIV-ECs) with a suppressed viremia. We carried out a retrospective
      study in 30 HIV-ECs classified into two groups: those showing no significant loss
      of CD4+ T-cells during the observation period (stable CD4+, n = 19) and those
      showing a significant decrease of CD4+ T-cells (decline CD4+, n = 11). Baseline
      plasma biomarkers were measured using a multiplex immunoassay: sTNF-R1, TRAIL,
      sFas (APO), sFasL, TNF-α, TNF-β, IL-8, IL-18, IL-6, IL-10, IP-10, MCP-1, MIP-1α, 
      MIP-1β, RANTES, SDF1α, GRO-α, and CCL11. Baseline levels of sTNF-R1 and CCL11 and
      sTNF-R1/TNF-α ratio correlated with the slope of CD4+ T-cells (cells/μl/year)
      during follow-up [r = −0.370 (p = 0.043), r = −0.314 (p = 0.091), and r = −0.381 
      (p = 0.038); respectively]. HIV-ECs with declining CD4+ T-cells had higher
      baseline plasma levels of sTNF-R1 [1,500.7 (555.7; 2,060.7) pg/ml vs. 450.8
      (227.9; 1,263.9) pg/ml; p = 0.018] and CCL11 [29.8 (23.5; 54.9) vs. 19.2 (17.8;
      29.9) pg/ml; p = 0.041], and sTNF-R1/TNF-α ratio [84.7 (33.2; 124.2) vs. 25.9
      (16.3; 75.1); p = 0.012] than HIV-1 ECs with stable CD4+ T-cells. The area under 
      the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve [area under ROC curve (AUROC)] 
      were 0.758 ± 0.093 (sTNF-R1), 0.727 ± 0.096 (CCL11), and 0.777 ± 0.087
      (sTNF-R1/TNF-α). The cut-off of 75th percentile (high values) for these
      biomarkers had 71.4% positive predictive value and 73.9% negative predictive
      value for anticipating the evolution of CD4+ T-cells. In conclusion, the loss of 
      CD4+ T-cells in HIV-ECs was associated with higher levels of two plasma
      inflammatory biomarkers (sTNF-R1 and CCL11), which were also reasonably accurate 
      for the prediction of the CD4+ T-cells loss.

      circulating microRNA markers of colorectal cancer prognosis.
LID - 20
AB  - Recent advances in high-throughput technologies have provided an unprecedented
      opportunity to identify molecular markers of disease processes. This plethora of 
      complex-omics data has simultaneously complicated the problem of extracting
      meaningful molecular signatures and opened up new opportunities for more
      sophisticated integrative and holistic approaches. In this era, effective
      integration of data-driven and knowledge-based approaches for biomarker
      identification has been recognised as key to improving the identification of
      high-performance biomarkers, and necessary for translational applications. Here, 
      we have evaluated the role of circulating microRNA as a means of predicting the
      prognosis of patients with colorectal cancer, which is the second leading cause
      of cancer-related death worldwide. We have developed a multi-objective
      optimisation method that effectively integrates a data-driven approach with the
      knowledge obtained from the microRNA-mediated regulatory network to identify
      robust plasma microRNA signatures which are reliable in terms of predictive power
      as well as functional relevance. The proposed multi-objective framework has the
      capacity to adjust for conflicting biomarker objectives and to incorporate
      heterogeneous information facilitating systems approaches to biomarker discovery.
      We have found a prognostic signature of colorectal cancer comprising 11
      circulating microRNAs. The identified signature predicts the patients’ survival
      outcome and targets pathways underlying colorectal cancer progression. The
      altered expression of the identified microRNAs was confirmed in an independent
      public data set of plasma samples of patients in early stage vs advanced
      colorectal cancer. Furthermore, the generality of the proposed method was
      demonstrated across three publicly available miRNA data sets associated with
      biomarker studies in other diseases.

TI  - Tissue Distribution and Visualization of Internalized Human Norovirus in Leafy
      Greens.
LID - e00292-18
AB  - Lettuce has been implicated in human norovirus (HuNoV) outbreaks. The virus is
      stable on the leaf surface for at least 2 weeks; however, the dynamics of virus
      internalization have not been fully investigated. The purpose of this study was
      to assess the internalization and distribution of HuNoV and two surrogate
      viruses, porcine sapovirus (SaV) and Tulane virus (TV), in lettuce and spinach.
      Viral inoculations through the roots of seedlings and the petiole of leaves from 
      mature plants were performed, and the viruses were tracked on days 1 and 6
      post-root inoculation and at 16 h and 72 h post-petiole inoculation. Confocal
      microscopy was used to visualize root-internalized HuNoV. In both lettuce and
      spinach, (i) HuNoV was internalized into the roots and leaves at similar RNA
      titers, whereas surrogate viruses were more restricted to the roots, (ii) all
      three viruses were stable inside the roots and leaves for at least 6 days, and
      (iii) HuNoV disseminated similarly inside the central veins and leaf lamina,
      whereas surrogate viruses were more restricted to the central veins. Infectious
      TV, but not SaV, was detectable in all tissues, suggesting that TV has greater
      stability than SaV. HuNoV was visualized inside the roots' vascular bundle and
      the leaf mesophyll of both plants. In conclusion, using surrogate viruses may
      underestimate the level of HuNoV internalization into edible leaves. The
      internalization of HuNoV through roots and cut leaves and the dissemination into 
      various spinach and lettuce tissues raise concerns of internal contamination
      through irrigation and/or wash water.IMPORTANCE Human noroviruses are the leading
      cause of foodborne outbreaks, with lettuce being implicated in the majority of
      outbreaks. The virus causes acute gastroenteritis in all age groups, with more
      severe symptoms in children, the elderly, and immunocompromised patients,
      contributing to over 200,000 deaths worldwide annually. The majority of deaths
      due to HuNoV occur in the developing world, where limited sanitation exists along
      with poor wastewater treatment facilities, resulting in the contamination of
      water resources that are often used for irrigation. Our study confirms the
      ability of lettuce and spinach to internalize HuNoV from contaminated water
      through the roots into the edible leaves. Since these leafy greens are consumed
      with minimal processing that targets only surface pathogens, the internalized
      HuNoV presents an added risk to consumers. Thus, preventive measures should be in
      place to limit the contamination of irrigation water. In addition, better
      processing technologies are needed to inactivate internalized viral pathogens.

TI  - Poaching Detection Technologies—A Survey.
LID - 1474
AB  - Between 1960 and 1990, 95% of the black rhino population in the world was killed.
      In South Africa, a rhino was killed every 8 h for its horn throughout 2016. Wild 
      animals, rhinos and elephants, in particular, are facing an ever increasing
      poaching crisis. In this paper, we review poaching detection technologies that
      aim to save endangered species from extinction. We present requirements for
      effective poacher detection and identify research challenges through the survey. 
      We describe poaching detection technologies in four domains: perimeter based,
      ground based, aerial based, and animal tagging based technologies. Moreover, we
      discuss the different types of sensor technologies that are used in intruder
      detection systems such as: radar, magnetic, acoustic, optic, infrared and
      thermal, radio frequency, motion, seismic, chemical, and animal sentinels. The
      ultimate long-term solution for the poaching crisis is to remove the drivers of
      demand by educating people in demanding countries and raising awareness of the
      poaching crisis. Until prevention of poaching takes effect, there will be a
      continuous urgent need for new (combined) approaches that take up the research
      challenges and provide better protection against poaching in wildlife areas.

TI  - Researcher and Author Impact Metrics: Variety, Value, and Context.
LID - e139
AB  - Numerous quantitative indicators are currently available for evaluating research 
      productivity. No single metric is suitable for comprehensive evaluation of the
      author-level impact. The choice of particular metrics depends on the purpose and 
      context of the evaluation. The aim of this article is to overview some of the
      widely employed author impact metrics and highlight perspectives of their optimal
      use. The h-index is one of the most popular metrics for research evaluation,
      which is easy to calculate and understandable for non-experts. It is
      automatically displayed on researcher and author profiles on citation databases
      such as Scopus and Web of Science. Its main advantage relates to the combined
      approach to the quantification of publication and citation counts. This index is 
      increasingly cited globally. Being an appropriate indicator of publication and
      citation activity of highly productive and successfully promoted authors, the
      h-index has been criticized primarily for disadvantaging early career researchers
      and authors with a few indexed publications. Numerous variants of the index have 
      been proposed to overcome its limitations. Alternative metrics have also emerged 
      to highlight ‘societal impact.’ However, each of these traditional and
      alternative metrics has its own drawbacks, necessitating careful analyses of the 
      context of social attention and value of publication and citation sets.
      Perspectives of the optimal use of researcher and author metrics is dependent on 
      evaluation purposes and compounded by information sourced from various global,
      national, and specialist bibliographic databases.

TI  - Investigating the Nutritional and Recovery Habits of Tennis Players.
LID - 443
AB  - In this study, the nutritional and recovery habits of tennis players pre-,
      during, and post-match-play were investigated. Seventy tennis players completed a
      bespoke nutrition and recovery habits questionnaire, with questions related to
      the following areas: match preparation, intra-match nutritional habits, situation
      dependent variables, and post-match nutrition and recovery. On match day-1, the
      consumption of balanced meals consisting of carbohydrate (CHO), fat and protein, 
      with some micronutrient considerations were reported by 51% of players. On
      match-days, CHOs were prioritised prior to match-play with CHO dominant meals
      consumed by the majority of players. During matches, all players adopted a
      nutritional strategy, with water (94%), banana(s) (86%) and sports drinks (50%)
      commonly used. Carbohydrate rich nutritional aids, including sports drinks (80%) 
      and energy gels (26%) were utilised more readily during long matches (>2 h). The 
      day after match-play, 39% of players reported the consumption of “nothing
      specific”. Multiple post-match recovery strategies were adopted by 80% of
      players, with foam rolling (77%), ice baths (40%), protein shake intake (37%) and
      hot baths (26%) most used. Findings indicate highly variable eating and recovery 
      habits in tennis players pre-, during and post-match-play, with scope for
      improved practices.

TI  - Self domestication and the evolution of language.
LID - 9
AB  - We set out an account of how self-domestication plays a crucial role in the
      evolution of language. In doing so, we focus on the growing body of work that
      treats language structure as emerging from the process of cultural transmission. 
      We argue that a full recognition of the importance of cultural transmission
      fundamentally changes the kind of questions we should be asking regarding the
      biological basis of language structure. If we think of language structure as
      reflecting an accumulated set of changes in our genome, then we might ask
      something like, “What are the genetic bases of language structure and why were
      they selected?” However, if cultural evolution can account for language
      structure, then this question no longer applies. Instead, we face the task of
      accounting for the origin of the traits that enabled that process of
      structure-creating cultural evolution to get started in the first place. In light
      of work on cultural evolution, then, the new question for biological evolution
      becomes, “How did those precursor traits evolve?” We identify two key precursor
      traits: (1) the transmission of the communication system through learning; and
      (2) the ability to infer the communicative intent associated with a signal or
      action. We then describe two comparative case studies—the Bengalese finch and the
      domestic dog—in which parallel traits can be seen emerging following
      domestication. Finally, we turn to the role of domestication in human evolution. 
      We argue that the cultural evolution of language structure has its origin in an
      earlier process of self-domestication.

TI  - The psychology of social class: How socioeconomic status impacts thought,
      feelings, and behaviour.
PG  - 267-91
AB  - Drawing on recent research on the psychology of social class, I argue that the
      material conditions in which people grow up and live have a lasting impact on
      their personal and social identities and that this influences both the way they
      think and feel about their social environment and key aspects of their social
      behaviour. Relative to middle‐class counterparts, lower/working‐class individuals
      are less likely to define themselves in terms of their socioeconomic status and
      are more likely to have interdependent self‐concepts; they are also more inclined
      to explain social events in situational terms, as a result of having a lower
      sense of personal control. Working‐class people score higher on measures of
      empathy and are more likely to help others in distress. The widely held view that
      working‐class individuals are more prejudiced towards immigrants and ethnic
      minorities is shown to be a function of economic threat, in that highly educated 
      people also express prejudice towards these groups when the latter are described 
      as highly educated and therefore pose an economic threat. The fact that
      middle‐class norms of independence prevail in universities and prestigious
      workplaces makes working‐class people less likely to apply for positions in such 
      institutions, less likely to be selected and less likely to stay if selected. In 
      other words, social class differences in identity, cognition, feelings, and
      behaviour make it less likely that working‐class individuals can benefit from
      educational and occupational opportunities to improve their material
      circumstances. This means that redistributive policies are needed to break the
      cycle of deprivation that limits opportunities and threatens social cohesion.

TI  - Transcription Factor Target Gene Network governs the Logical Abstraction Analysis
      of the Synthetic Circuit in Leishmaniasis.
LID - 3464
AB  - With the advent of synthetic biology in medicine many synthetic or engineered
      proteins have made their way to therapeutics and diagnostics. In this paper, the 
      downstream gene network of CD14-TNF-EGFR pathway in leishmaniasis, a tropical
      disease, is reconstructed. Network analysis showed that NFkB links the signaling 
      and gene network, used as a point of intervention through a synthetic circuit
      embedded within the negative autoregulatory feedback loop. A chimeric protein
      kinase C (PKC) is incorporated in the synthetic circuit, under the
      transcriptional regulation of Lac repressor and IPTG, as an inducer. The chimeric
      PKC_ζα via IκKb phosphorylation activates NFκB, and modulates the gene expression
      from an anti-inflammatory to a pro-inflammatory phenotype in in vitro L. major
      infected macrophage model. This is the first ever report of a synthetic device
      construction in leishmania.

TI  - Is it a match? a novel method of evaluating medical school success.
LID - 1432231
AB  - Background: Medical education program evaluation allows for curricular
      improvements to both Undergraduate (UME) and Graduate Medical Education (GME).
      UME programs are left with little more than match rates and self-report to
      evaluate success of graduates in The Match.Objective: This manuscript shares a
      novel method of program evaluation through a systematic assessment of Match
      outcomes.Design: Surveys were developed and distributed to Program Training
      Directors (PTDs) at our institution to classify residency programs into which our
      UME graduates matched using an ordinal response scale and open-ended responses.
      Outcomes-based measures for UME graduates were collected and analyzed. The
      relationship between PTD survey data and UME graduates’ outcomes were explored.
      Open-ended response data were qualitatively analyzed using iterative cycles of
      coding and identifying themes.Results: The PTD survey response rate was 100%. 71%
      of our graduates matched to programs ranked as ‘elite’ (36%) or ‘top’ (35%) tier.
      The mean total number of ‘Honors’ grades achieved by UME graduates was 2.6. Data 
      showed that graduates entering elite and top GME programs did not consistently
      earn Honors in their associated clerkships. A positive correlation was identified
      between USMLE Step 1 score, number of honors, and residency program rankings for 
      a majority of the programs. Qualitative analysis identified research, faculty,
      and clinical exposure as necessary characteristics of ‘elite’ programs:. Factors 
      considered by PTDs in the rating of programs included reputation, faculty,
      research, national presence and quality of graduates.Conclusions: This study
      describes a novel outcomes-based method of evaluating the success of UME
      programs. Results provided useful feedback about the quality of our UME program
      and its ability to produce graduates who match in highly-regarded GME programs.
      The findings from this study can benefit Clerkship Directors, Student Affairs and
      Curriculam Deans, and residency PTDs as they help students determine their
      competitiveness forspecialties and specific residency programs.

TI  - Skill not athleticism predicts individual variation in match performance of
      soccer players.
LID - 20170953
AB  - Just as evolutionary biologists endeavour to link phenotypes to fitness, sport
      scientists try to identify traits that determine athlete success. Both
      disciplines would benefit from collaboration, and to illustrate this, we used an 
      analytical approach common to evolutionary biology to isolate the phenotypes that
      promote success in soccer, a complex activity of humans played in nearly every
      modern society. Using path analysis, we quantified the relationships among
      morphology, balance, skill, athleticism and performance of soccer players. We
      focused on performance in two complex motor activities: a simple game of soccer
      tennis (1 on 1), and a standard soccer match (11 on 11). In both contests,
      players with greater skill and balance were more likely to perform better.
      However, maximal athletic ability was not associated with success in a game. A
      social network analysis revealed that skill also predicted movement. The
      relationships between phenotypes and success during individual and team sports
      have potential implications for how selection acts on these phenotypes, in humans
      and other species, and thus should ultimately interest evolutionary biologists.
      Hence, we propose a field of evolutionary sports science that lies at the nexus
      of evolutionary biology and sports science. This would allow biologists to take
      advantage of the staggering quantity of data on performance in sporting events to
      answer evolutionary questions that are more difficult to answer for other
      species. In return, sports scientists could benefit from the theoretical
      framework developed to study natural selection in non-human species.

TI  - The implementation of medical revalidation: an assessment using normalisation
      process theory.
LID - 749
AB  - Background: Medical revalidation is the process by which all licensed doctors are
      legally required to demonstrate that they are up to date and fit to practise in
      order to maintain their licence. Revalidation was introduced in the United
      Kingdom (UK) in 2012, constituting significant change in the regulation of
      doctors. The governing body, the General Medical Council (GMC), envisages that
      revalidation will improve patient care and safety. This potential however is, in 
      part, dependent upon how successfully revalidation is embedded into routine
      practice. The aim of this study was to use Normalisation Process Theory (NPT) to 
      explore issues contributing to or impeding the implementation of revalidation in 
      practice. Methods: We conducted seventy-one interviews with sixty UK policymakers
      and senior leaders at different points during the development and implementation 
      of revalidation: in 2011 (n = 31), 2013 (n = 26) and 2015 (n = 14). We selected
      interviewees using purposeful sampling. NPT was used as a framework to enable
      systematic analysis across the interview sets. Results: Initial lack of consensus
      over revalidation’s purpose, and scepticism about its value, decreased over time 
      as participants recognised the benefits it brought to their practice (coherence
      category of NPT). Though acceptance increased across time, revalidation was not
      seen as a legitimate part of their role by all doctors. Key individuals, notably 
      the Responsible Officer (RO), were vital for the successful implementation of
      revalidation in organisations (cognitive participation category). The ease with
      which revalidation could be integrated into working practices varied greatly
      depending on the type of role a doctor held and the organisation they work for
      and the provision of resources was a significant variable in this (collective
      action category). Formal evaluation of revalidation in organisations was lacking 
      but informal evaluation was taking place. Revalidation had not yet reached the
      stage where feedback was being used for improvement (reflexive monitoring
      category). Conclusions: Requiring all organisations to use the same revalidation 
      model made revalidation easy to integrate into existing work for some but
      problematic for others. In order for revalidation to be fully embedded and
      successful, impeding factors, such as a lack of resources, need to be addressed.

PG  - 388-96
AB  - Objectives: To analyse the influence of genetic alterations and differential
      expression of transcription intermediary factor 1 (TIF1) genes in the
      pathophysiology of cancer-associated myositis (CAM). Methods: Paired blood and
      tumour DNA samples from patients with anti-TIF1γ-positive CAM and from controls
      were analysed by whole-exome sequencing for the presence of somatic mutations and
      loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in their TIF1 genes. The genesis and maintenance of 
      the autoimmune process were investigated immunohistochemically by studying TIF1γ 
      expression in the different tissues involved in CAM (skin, muscle and tumour)
      based on the immunohistochemical H-score. Results: From seven patients with
      anti-TIF1γ-positive CAM, we detected one somatic mutation and five cases of LOH
      in one or more of the four TIF1 genes compared with just one case of LOH in
      tumours from TIF1γ-negative myositis patients (86% vs 17%; P = 0.03). Compared
      with type-matched control tumours from non-myositis patients, TIF1γ staining was 
      more intense in tumours from anti-TIF1γ-positive patients (H-score 255 vs 196; P 
      = 0.01). Also, TIF1γ staining in muscle was slightly more intense in
      anti-TIF1γ-positive than in anti-TIF1γ-negative myositis (H-score 22 vs 5; P =
      0.03). In contrast, intense TIF1γ staining was detected in the skin of both
      myositis and control patients. Conclusion: Tumours from paraneoplastic
      anti-TIF1γ-positive patients showed an increased number of genetic alterations,
      such as mutations and LOH, in TIF1 genes. These genetic alterations, in the
      context of a high expression of TIF1γ in the tumour, muscle and skin of these
      patients may be key to understanding the genesis of paraneoplastic myositis.

TI  - Populism and Support for Protectionism: The Relevance of Opposition to Trade
      Openness for Leftist and Rightist Populist Voting in The Netherlands.
PG  - 560-76
AB  - Leftist and rightist populist parties in Western Europe both oppose trade
      openness. Is support for economic protectionism also relevant for their
      electorates? We assess this in the Netherlands, where both types of populist
      parties have seats in parliament. Analyses of representative survey data
      (n = 1,296) demonstrate that support for protectionism drives voting for such
      parties, as do the well-established determinants of political distrust (both
      populist constituencies), economic egalitarianism (leftist populist constituency)
      and ethnocentrism (rightist populist constituency). Surprisingly, support for
      protectionism does not mediate the relationship between economic egalitarianism
      and voting for left-wing populists, or the link between political distrust and
      voting for either left-wing or right-wing populist parties. In contrast, support 
      for protectionism partly mediates the association between ethnocentrism and
      voting for right-wing populists. We discuss the largely independent role of
      protectionism in populist voting in relation to the cultural cleavage in politics
      and electoral competition, and also provide suggestions for future research.

TI  - How is success achieved by individuals innovating for patient safety and quality 
      in the NHS?
LID - 640
AB  - Background: Innovation in healthcare is said to be notoriously difficult to
      achieve and sustain yet simultaneously the health service is under intense
      pressure to innovate given the ever increasing demands placed upon it. Whilst
      many studies have looked at diffusion of innovation from an organisational
      perspective, few have sought to understand how individuals working in healthcare 
      innovate successfully. We took a positive deviance approach to understand how
      innovations are achieved by individuals working in the NHS. Method: We conducted 
      in depth interviews in 2015 with 15 individuals who had received a national award
      for being a successful UK innovator in healthcare. We invited only those people
      who were currently (or had recently) worked in the NHS and whose innovation
      focused on improving patient safety or quality. Thematic analysis was used.
      Findings: Four themes emerged from the data: personal determination, the ability 
      to broker relationships and make connections, the ways in which innovators were
      able to navigate organisational culture to their advantage and their ability to
      use evidence to influence others. Determination, focus and persistence were
      important personal characteristics of innovators as were skills in being able to 
      challenge the status quo. Innovators were able to connect sometimes disparate
      teams and people, being the broker between them in negotiating collaborative
      working. The culture of the organisation these participants resided in was
      important with some being able to use this (and the current patient safety
      agenda) to their advantage. Gathering robust data to demonstrate their innovation
      had a positive impact and was seen as essential to its progression. Conclusions: 
      This paper reveals a number of factors which are important to the success of
      innovators in healthcare. We have uncovered that innovators have particular
      personal traits which encourage a propensity towards change and action. Yet, for 
      fruitful innovation to take place, it is important for relational networks and
      organisational culture to be receptive to change.

TI  - Tobacco control law implementation in a middle-income country: Transnational
      tobacco control network overcoming tobacco industry opposition in Colombia.
PG  - 1050-64
AB  - The objective of this paper is to examine the implementation of Colombia’s
      tobacco control law. Methods involved are triangulated government legislation,
      news sources, and interviews with policy-makers and health advocates in Colombia.
      Colombia, a middle-income country, passed a tobacco control law in 2009 that
      included a prohibition on tobacco advertising, promotion, and sponsorship; and
      required pictorial health warning labels, ingredients disclosure, and a
      prohibition on individual cigarette sales. Tobacco companies challenged the
      implementation through litigation, tested government enforcement of advertising
      provisions and regulations on ingredients disclosure, and lobbied local
      governments to deprioritise policy responses to single cigarette sales. A
      transnational network including international health groups and funders helped
      strengthen domestic capacity to implement the law by; promoting public awareness 
      of Ley [Law] 1335; training local health department staff on enforcement;
      facilitating health agencies’ sharing of educational strategies; and providing
      legal defence assistance. This network included vigilant efforts by local health 
      groups, which continuously monitored and alerted the media to noncompliance,
      engaged government officials and policy-makers on implementation, and raised
      public awareness. Support from international health NGOs and funders and
      continuous engagement by local health groups enhanced implementation capacities
      to counter continued tobacco industry interference and ensure effective tobacco
      control implementation.

TI  - A rapid and efficient in vitro regeneration system for lettuce (Lactuca sativa
      L.).
LID - 58
AB  - Background: Successful biotechnological improvement of crop plants requires a
      reliable and efficient in vitro regeneration system. Lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.),
      one the most important vegetable crops worldwide, is strongly genotype-dependent 
      in terms of regeneration capacity, limiting the potential for biotechnological
      improvement of cultivars which show recalcitrance under currently available
      protocols. The effect of different nutrient sources, plant hormone combinations
      and activated charcoal supplementation on shoot induction efficiency was
      evaluated on the cultivar ‘RSL NFR’, which had previously shown poor regeneration
      efficiency. Results: Multiple shoot organogenesis from cotyledon explants was
      recorded at the highest frequency and speed on Murashige and Skoog regeneration
      medium supplemented with 200 mg/l of activated charcoal, 3% sucrose, 10 mg/l
      benzylaminopurine and 0.5 mg/l naphthaleneacetic acid, which induced shoots
      through direct regeneration in 90.8 ± 7.9% of explants. High shoot induction
      efficiency was also observed, albeit not quantified, when using this medium on
      some other cultivars. Conclusions: This activated charcoal-containing
      regeneration medium might offer a rapid and efficient option for direct shoot
      induction in some lettuce genotypes that do not respond well to common lettuce
      regeneration protocols. This is also the first report of the effect of activated 
      charcoal in lettuce tissue culture. Electronic supplementary material: The online
      version of this article (doi:10.1186/s13007-017-0208-0) contains supplementary

TI  - Populism, Exclusion, Post-truth. Some Conceptual Caveats: Comment on "The Rise of
      Post-truth Populism in Pluralist Liberal Democracies: Challenges for Health
      Policy" .
PG  - 268-71
AB  - In their editorial, Speed and Mannion identify two main challenges "the rise of
      post-truth populism" poses for health policy: the populist threat to inclusive
      healthcare policies, and the populist threat to well-designed health policies
      that draw on professional expertise and research evidence. This short comment
      suggests some conceptual clarifications that might help in thinking through more 
      profoundly these two important issues. It argues that we should approach
      right-wing populism as a combination of a populist down/up (people/elite) axis
      with an exclusionary nationalist in/out (member/non-member) axis. And it raises
      some questions regarding the equation between populism, demagogy and the
      rejection of expertise and scientific knowledge.

TI  - Molecular engineering and plant expression of an immunoglobulin heavy chain
      scaffold for delivery of a dengue vaccine candidate.
PG  - 1590-601
AB  - In order to enhance vaccine uptake by the immune cells in vivo, molecular
      engineering approach was employed to construct a polymeric immunoglobulin G
      scaffold (PIGS) that incorporates multiple copies of an antigen and targets the
      Fc gamma receptors on antigen‐presenting cells. These self‐adjuvanting immunogens
      were tested in the context of dengue infection, for which there is currently no
      globally licensed vaccine yet. Thus, the consensus domain III sequence (cEDIII)
      of dengue glycoprotein E was incorporated into PIGS and expressed in both tobacco
      plants and Chinese Ovary Hamster cells. Purified mouse and human cEDIII‐PIGS were
      fractionated by HPLC into low and high molecular weight forms, corresponding to
      monomers, dimers and polymers. cEDIII‐PIGS were shown to retain important Fc
      receptor functions associated with immunoglobulins, including binding to C1q
      component of the complement and the low affinity Fcγ receptor II, as well as to
      macrophage cells in vitro. These molecules were shown to be immunogenic in mice, 
      with or without an adjuvant, inducing a high level IgG antibody response which
      showed a neutralizing potential against the dengue virus serotype 2. The
      cEDIII‐PIGS also induced a significant cellular immune response, IFN‐γ production
      and polyfunctional T cells in both the CD4+ and CD8+ compartments. This
      proof‐of‐principle study shows that the potent antibody Fc‐mediated cellular
      functions can be harnessed to improve vaccine design, underscoring the potential 
      of this technology to induce and modulate a broad‐ranging immune response.

TI  - Causes and consequences of the rise of populist radical right parties and
      movements in Europe.
PG  - 909-30
AB  - This article reviews three strands in the scholarship on the populist radical
      right (PRR). It covers both political parties and extra-parliamentary
      mobilization in contemporary European democracies. After definitional issues and 
      case selection, the authors first discuss demand-side approaches to the fortunes 
      of the PRR. Subsequently, supply-side approaches are assessed, namely political
      opportunity explanations and internal supply-side factors, referring to
      leadership, organization and ideological positioning. Third, research on the
      consequences of the emergence and rise of these parties and movements is
      examined: do they constitute a corrective or a threat to democracy? The authors
      discuss the growing literature on the impact on established parties’ policies,
      the policies themselves, and citizens’ behaviour. The review concludes with
      future directions for theorizing and research.

TI  - Radical distinction: Support for radical left and radical right parties in
      Europe.
PG  - 536-59
AB  - Support for radical parties on both the left and right is on the rise, fueling
      intuition that both radicalisms have similar underpinnings. Indeed, existing
      studies show that radical left and right voters have overlapping positions and
      preferences. In this article, however, we focus on the differences in the voting 
      bases of such parties. We show that radical left and right voters have sharply
      diverging ideological profiles. When it comes to the historical traditions of the
      ‘left’ and ‘right’, these voters differ radically from each other. Both groups
      express the traditions associated with their mainstream counterparts—particularly
      with respect to (non-)egalitarian, (non-)altruistic, and (anti-)cosmopolitan
      values. Such differences also explain why radical left voters tend to be more,
      not less, educated than mainstream or radical right voters.

TI  - Mechanisms of Virologic Control and Clinical Characteristics of HIV+
      Elite/Viremic Controllers.
PG  - 245-59
AB  - Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) disease is pandemic, with
      approximately 36 million infected individuals world-wide. For the vast majority
      of these individuals, untreated HIV eventually causes CD4+ T cell depletion and
      profound immunodeficiency, resulting in morbidity and mortality. But for a
      remarkable few (0.2 to 0.5 percent), termed elite controllers (ECs), viral loads 
      (VLs) remain suppressed to undetectable levels (< 50 copies/ml) and peripheral
      CD4+ T cell counts remain high (200 to 1000/μl), all in the absence of
      antiretroviral therapy (ART). Viremic controllers (VCs) are a similar but larger 
      subset of HIV-1 infected individuals who have the ability to suppress their VLs
      to low levels. These patients have been intensively studied over the last 10
      years in order to determine how they are able to naturally control HIV in the
      absence of medications, and a variety of mechanisms have been proposed. Defective
      HIV does not explain the clinical status of most ECs/VCs; rather these
      individuals appear to somehow control HIV infection, through immune or other
      unknown mechanisms. Over time, many ECs and VCs eventually lose the ability to
      control HIV, leading to CD4+ T cell depletion and immunologic dysfunction in the 
      absence of ART. Elucidating novel mechanisms of HIV control in this group of
      patients will be an important step in understanding HIV infection. This will
      extend our knowledge of HIV-host interaction and may pave the way for the
      development of new therapeutic approaches and advance the cure agenda.

TI  - The Validity and Responsiveness of Isometric Lower Body Multi-Joint Tests of
      Muscular Strength: a Systematic Review.
LID - 23
AB  - Background: Researchers and practitioners working in sports medicine and science 
      require valid tests to determine the effectiveness of interventions and enhance
      understanding of mechanisms underpinning adaptation. Such decision making is
      influenced by the supportive evidence describing the validity of tests within
      current research. The objective of this study is to review the validity of lower 
      body isometric multi-joint tests ability to assess muscular strength and
      determine the current level of supporting evidence. Methods: Preferred Reporting 
      Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines were followed 
      in a systematic fashion to search, assess and synthesize existing literature on
      this topic. Electronic databases such as Web of Science, CINAHL and PubMed were
      searched up to 18 March 2015. Potential inclusions were screened against
      eligibility criteria relating to types of test, measurement instrument,
      properties of validity assessed and population group and were required to be
      published in English. The Consensus-based Standards for the Selection of health
      Measurement Instruments (COSMIN) checklist was used to assess methodological
      quality and measurement property rating of included studies. Studies rated as
      fair or better in methodological quality were included in the best evidence
      synthesis. Results: Fifty-nine studies met the eligibility criteria for quality
      appraisal. The ten studies that rated fair or better in methodological quality
      were included in the best evidence synthesis. The most frequently investigated
      lower body isometric multi-joint tests for validity were the isometric mid-thigh 
      pull and isometric squat. The validity of each of these tests was strong in terms
      of reliability and construct validity. The evidence for responsiveness of tests
      was found to be moderate for the isometric squat test and unknown for the
      isometric mid-thigh pull. No tests using the isometric leg press met the criteria
      for inclusion in the best evidence synthesis. Conclusions: Researchers and
      practitioners can use the isometric squat and isometric mid-thigh pull with
      confidence in terms of reliability and construct validity. Further work to
      investigate other validity components such as criterion validity, smallest
      detectable change and responsiveness to resistance exercise interventions may be 
      beneficial to the current level of evidence. Electronic supplementary material:

TI  - Vegetable Grafting: The Implications of a Growing Agronomic Imperative for
      Vegetable Fruit Quality and Nutritive Value.
LID - 741
AB  - Grafting has become an imperative for intensive vegetable production since
      chlorofluorocarbon-based soil fumigants were banned from use on grounds of
      environmental protection. Compelled by this development, research into
      rootstock–scion interaction has broadened the potential applications of grafting 
      in the vegetable industry beyond aspects of soil phytopathology. Grafting has
      been increasingly tapped for cultivation under adverse environs posing abiotic
      and biotic stresses to vegetable crops, thus enabling expansion of commercial
      production onto otherwise under-exploited land. Vigorous rootstocks have been
      employed not only in the open field but also under protected cultivation where
      increase in productivity improves distribution of infrastructural and energy
      costs. Applications of grafting have expanded mainly in two families: the
      Cucurbitaceae and the Solanaceae, both of which comprise major vegetable crops.
      As the main drives behind the expansion of vegetable grafting have been the
      resistance to soilborne pathogens, tolerance to abiotic stresses and increase in 
      yields, rootstock selection and breeding have accordingly conformed to the
      prevailing demand for improving productivity, arguably at the expense of fruit
      quality. It is, however, compelling to assess the qualitative implications of
      this growing agronomic practice for human nutrition. Problems of impaired
      vegetable fruit quality have not infrequently been associated with the practice
      of grafting. Accordingly, the aim of the current review is to reassess how the
      practice of grafting and the prevalence of particular types of commercial
      rootstocks influence vegetable fruit quality and, partly, storability. Physical, 
      sensorial and bioactive aspects of quality are examined with respect to grafting 
      for watermelon, melon, cucumber, tomato, eggplant, and pepper. The physiological 
      mechanisms at play which mediate rootstock effects on scion performance are
      discussed in interpreting the implications of grafting for the configuration of
      vegetable fruit physicochemical quality and nutritive value.

TI  - Science to the rescue or contingent progress? Comparing 10 years of public,
      expert and policy discourses on new and emerging science and technology in the
      United Kingdom.
PG  - 655-73
AB  - Over the past 10 years, numerous public debates on new and emerging science and
      technologies have taken place in the United Kingdom. In this article, we
      characterise the discourses emerging from these debates and compare them to the
      discourses in analogous expert scientific and policy reports. We find that while 
      the public is broadly supportive of new scientific developments, they see the
      risks and social and ethical issues associated with them as unpredictable but
      inherent parts of the developments. In contrast, the scientific experts and
      policymakers see risks and social and ethical issues as manageable and
      quantifiable with more research and knowledge. We argue that these differences
      amount to two different sociotechnical imaginaries or views of science and how it
      shapes our world – an elite imaginary of ‘science to the rescue’ shared by
      scientists and policymakers and public counter-imaginary of ‘contingent
      progress’. We argue that these two imaginaries indicate that, but also help
      explain why, public dialogue has had limited impact on public policy.

TI  - Deterministic versus stochastic model of reprogramming: new evidence from
      cellular barcoding technique.
LID - 160311
AB  - Factor-mediated reprogramming of somatic cells towards pluripotency is a
      low-efficiency process during which only small subsets of cells are successfully 
      reprogrammed. Previous analyses of the determinants of the reprogramming
      potential are based on average measurements across a large population of cells or
      on monitoring a relatively small number of single cells with live imaging. Here, 
      we applied lentiviral genetic barcoding, a powerful tool enabling the
      identification of familiar relationships in thousands of cells. High-throughput
      sequencing of barcodes from successfully reprogrammed cells revealed a
      significant number of barcodes from related cells. We developed a computer model,
      according to which a probability of synchronous reprogramming of sister cells
      equals 10–30%. We conclude that the reprogramming success is pre-established in
      some particular cells and, being a heritable trait, can be maintained through
      cell division. Thus, reprogramming progresses in a deterministic manner, at least
      at the level of cell lineages.

TI  - GeneHancer: genome-wide integration of enhancers and target genes in GeneCards.
LID - bax028
AB  - A major challenge in understanding gene regulation is the unequivocal
      identification of enhancer elements and uncovering their connections to genes. We
      present GeneHancer, a novel database of human enhancers and their inferred target
      genes, in the framework of GeneCards. First, we integrated a total of 434 000
      reported enhancers from four different genome-wide databases: the Encyclopedia of
      DNA Elements (ENCODE), the Ensembl regulatory build, the functional annotation of
      the mammalian genome (FANTOM) project and the VISTA Enhancer Browser. Employing
      an integration algorithm that aims to remove redundancy, GeneHancer portrays 285 
      000 integrated candidate enhancers (covering 12.4% of the genome), 94 000 of
      which are derived from more than one source, and each assigned an
      annotation-derived confidence score. GeneHancer subsequently links enhancers to
      genes, using: tissue co-expression correlation between genes and enhancer RNAs,
      as well as enhancer-targeted transcription factor genes; expression quantitative 
      trait loci for variants within enhancers; and capture Hi-C, a promoter-specific
      genome conformation assay. The individual scores based on each of these four
      methods, along with gene–enhancer genomic distances, form the basis for
      GeneHancer’s combinatorial likelihood-based scores for enhancer–gene pairing.
      Finally, we define ‘elite’ enhancer–gene relations reflecting both a
      high-likelihood enhancer definition and a strong enhancer–gene
      association.GeneHancer predictions are fully integrated in the widely used
      GeneCards Suite, whereby candidate enhancers and their annotations are displayed 
      on every relevant GeneCard. This assists in the mapping of non-coding variants to
      enhancers, and via the linked genes, forms a basis for variant–phenotype
      interpretation of whole-genome sequences in health and disease.Database

TI  - Knowledge of practice: A multi-sited event ethnography of border security fairs
      in Europe and North America.
PG  - 187-205
AB  - This article takes the reader inside four border security fairs in Europe and
      North America to examine the knowledge practices of border security
      professionals. Building on the border security as practice research agenda, the
      analysis focuses on the production, circulation, and consumption of scarce forms 
      of knowledge. To explore situated knowledge of border security practices, I
      develop an approach to multi-sited event ethnography to observe and interpret
      knowledge that may be hard to access at the security fairs. The analysis focuses 
      on mechanisms for disseminating and distributing scarce forms of knowledge,
      technological materializations of situated knowledge, expressions of transversal 
      knowledge of security problems, how masculinities structure knowledge in gendered
      ways, and how unease is expressed through imagined futures in order to anticipate
      emergent solutions to proposed security problems. The article concludes by
      reflecting on the contradictions at play at fairs and how to address such
      contradictions through alternative knowledges and practices.

TI  - Prospecting for an HIV vaccine.
LID - 6
AB  - Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) sets several challenges for the development of
      a preventative HIV vaccine. Predictable, protective natural immunity against HIV 
      does not occur and so unlike most other diseases for which vaccines exist, there 
      are few guideposts from natural infection. Nonetheless, six vaccine efficacy
      trials have occurred. One in particular, the Thai trial called RV144, showed
      partial protective efficacy and potential ways ahead to a better vaccine
      approach. This coupled with other lessons from studies of acute infections as
      well as an increasingly complex knowledge of HIV-related vaccine immunology bring
      hope that a vaccine solution might be reached for this pervasive and deadly
      pandemic.

TI  - DNA-informed breeding of rosaceous crops: promises, progress and prospects.
PG  - 17006-
AB  - Crops of the Rosaceae family provide valuable contributions to rural economies
      and human health and enjoyment. Sustained solutions to production challenges and 
      market demands can be met with genetically improved new cultivars. Traditional
      rosaceous crop breeding is expensive and time-consuming and would benefit from
      improvements in efficiency and accuracy. Use of DNA information is becoming
      conventional in rosaceous crop breeding, contributing to many decisions and
      operations, but only after past decades of solved challenges and generation of
      sufficient resources. Successes in deployment of DNA-based knowledge and tools
      have arisen when the ‘chasm’ between genomics discoveries and practical
      application is bridged systematically. Key steps are establishing breeder desire 
      for use of DNA information, adapting tools to local breeding utility, identifying
      efficient application schemes, accessing effective services in DNA-based
      diagnostics and gaining experience in integrating DNA information into breeding
      operations and decisions. DNA-informed germplasm characterization for revealing
      identity and relatedness has benefitted many programs and provides a compelling
      entry point to reaping benefits of genomics research. DNA-informed germplasm
      evaluation for predicting trait performance has enabled effective reallocation of
      breeding resources when applied in pioneering programs. DNA-based diagnostics is 
      now expanding from specific loci to genome-wide considerations. Realizing the
      full potential of this expansion will require improved accuracy of predictions,
      multi-trait DNA profiling capabilities, streamlined breeding information
      management systems, strategies that overcome plant-based features that limit
      breeding progress and widespread training of current and future breeding
      personnel and allied scientists.

TI  - Wealth, household heterogeneity and livelihood diversification of Fulani
      pastoralists in the Kachia Grazing Reserve, northern Nigeria, during a period of 
      social transition.
LID - e0172866
AB  - Background: A mixed methods study was undertaken in the Kachia Grazing Reserve of
      northern Nigeria. Surveys in March, June and October 2011 included focus group
      discussions, key informant and in-depth household interviews, concerning
      livelihood practices, animal health, ownership, and productivity. In May 2011,
      249 Fulani families fleeing post-election violence entered the reserve with their
      livestock, increasing the number of households by one third. Results: Despite
      being settled within a grazing reserve, over half of households sent all their
      cattle away on seasonal transhumance and another third sent some away. Cattle
      accounted for 96% of total tropical livestock units (TLU), of which 26% were
      cattle kept permanently outside the reserve. While all households cited livestock
      as their main source of income, 90% grew crops and 55% derived income from
      off-farm activities. A multiple correspondence analysis showed that for each
      extra member of a household its TLU value increased by 2.0 [95% CI, 1.4–2.7],
      while for each additional marriage its TLU increased by 15.7 [95% CI, 7.1–24.3]. 
      A strong association was also observed between small herds, small households with
      only one wife, alongside marked geographical wealth differences within the
      reserve. New immigrant families had larger household sizes (33) and livestock
      holdings (122 TLU) than old settlers (22 people and 67 TLU). Prior to the mass
      immigration, the distribution of TLU per person was unimodal: 41% of households
      were classified as ‘poor’ and 27% as ‘medium’, whereas post-immigration it was
      bi-modal, with 26% classified as ‘very poor’ and 28% as ‘medium’. Conclusions:
      While cattle remain the principal source of Fulani income and wealth, the
      inhabitants of Kachia Grazing Reserve have diversified their livelihood
      strategies to respond to changing circumstances and stress, especially the
      limited availability of grazing within the reserve and political insecurity
      outside, resulting in continued transhumance, the maintenance of smaller
      livestock holdings and pushing households into poverty.

TI  - An experimental validation of genomic selection in octoploid strawberry.
PG  - 16070-
AB  - The primary goal of genomic selection is to increase genetic gains for complex
      traits by predicting performance of individuals for which phenotypic data are not
      available. The objective of this study was to experimentally evaluate the
      potential of genomic selection in strawberry breeding and to define a strategy
      for its implementation. Four clonally replicated field trials, two in each of 2
      years comprised of a total of 1628 individuals, were established in 2013–2014 and
      2014–2015. Five complex yield and fruit quality traits with moderate to low
      heritability were assessed in each trial. High-density genotyping was performed
      with the Affymetrix Axiom IStraw90 single-nucleotide polymorphism array, and
      17 479 polymorphic markers were chosen for analysis. Several methods were
      compared, including Genomic BLUP, Bayes B, Bayes C, Bayesian LASSO Regression,
      Bayesian Ridge Regression and Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces. Cross-validation
      within training populations resulted in higher values than for true validations
      across trials. For true validations, Bayes B gave the highest predictive
      abilities on average and also the highest selection efficiencies, particularly
      for yield traits that were the lowest heritability traits. Selection efficiencies
      using Bayes B for parent selection ranged from 74% for average fruit weight to
      34% for early marketable yield. A breeding strategy is proposed in which advanced
      selection trials are utilized as training populations and in which genomic
      selection can reduce the breeding cycle from 3 to 2 years for a subset of
      untested parents based on their predicted genomic breeding values.

TI  - Does Elite Sport Degrade Sleep Quality? A Systematic Review.
PG  - 1317-33
AB  - Background: Information on sleep quality and insomnia symptomatology among elite 
      athletes remains poorly systematised in the sports science and medicine
      literature. The extent to which performance in elite sport represents a risk for 
      chronic insomnia is unknown. Objectives: The purpose of this systematic review
      was to profile the objective and experienced characteristics of sleep among elite
      athletes, and to consider relationships between elite sport and insomnia
      symptomatology. Methods: Studies relating to sleep involving participants
      described on a pre-defined continuum of ‘eliteness’ were located through a
      systematic search of four research databases: SPORTDiscus, PubMed, Science Direct
      and Google Scholar, up to April 2016. Once extracted, studies were categorised as
      (1) those mainly describing sleep structure/patterns, (2) those mainly describing
      sleep quality and insomnia symptomatology and (3) those exploring associations
      between aspects of elite sport and sleep outcomes. Results: The search returned
      1676 records. Following screening against set criteria, a total of 37 studies
      were identified. The quality of evidence reviewed was generally low. Pooled sleep
      quality data revealed high levels of sleep complaints in elite athletes. Three
      risk factors for sleep disturbance were broadly identified: (1) training, (2)
      travel and (3) competition. Conclusion: While acknowledging the limited number of
      high-quality evidence reviewed, athletes show a high overall prevalence of
      insomnia symptoms characterised by longer sleep latencies, greater sleep
      fragmentation, non-restorative sleep, and excessive daytime fatigue. These
      symptoms show marked inter-sport differences. Two underlying mechanisms are
      implicated in the mediation of sport-related insomnia symptoms: pre-sleep
      cognitive arousal and sleep restriction. Electronic supplementary material: The
      online version of this article (doi:10.1007/s40279-016-0650-6) contains

TI  - Left Ventricular Speckle Tracking-Derived Cardiac Strain and Cardiac Twist
      Mechanics in Athletes: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Controlled
      Studies.
PG  - 1145-70
AB  - Background: The athlete’s heart is associated with physiological remodeling as a 
      consequence of repetitive cardiac loading. The effect of exercise training on
      left ventricular (LV) cardiac strain and twist mechanics are equivocal, and no
      meta-analysis has been conducted to date. Objective: The objective of this
      systematic review and meta-analysis was to review the literature pertaining to
      the effect of different forms of athletic training on cardiac strain and twist
      mechanics and determine the influence of traditional and contemporary sporting
      classifications on cardiac strain and twist mechanics. Methods: We searched
      PubMed/MEDLINE, Web of Science, and ScienceDirect for controlled studies of
      aged-matched male participants aged 18–45 years that used two-dimensional (2D)
      speckle tracking with a defined athlete sporting discipline and a control group
      not engaged in training programs. Data were extracted independently by two
      reviewers. Random-effects meta-analyses, subgroup analyses, and meta-regressions 
      were conducted. Results: Our review included 13 studies with 945 participants
      (controls n = 355; athletes n = 590). Meta-analyses showed no athlete–control
      differences in LV strain or twist mechanics. However, moderator analyses showed
      greater LV twist in high-static low-dynamic athletes (d = –0.76, 95% confidence
      interval [CI] –1.32 to –0.20; p < 0.01) than in controls. Peak untwisting
      velocity (PUV) was greater in high-static low-dynamic athletes (d = –0.43, 95% CI
      –0.84 to –0.03; p < 0.05) but less than controls in high-static high-dynamic
      athletes (d = 0.79, 95% CI 0.002–1.58; p = 0.05). Elite endurance athletes had
      significantly less twist and apical rotation than controls (d = 0.68, 95% CI
      0.19–1.16, p < 0.01; d = 0.64, 95% CI 0.27–1.00, p = 0.001, respectively) but no 
      differences in basal rotation. Meta-regressions showed LV mass index was
      positively associated with global longitudinal (b = 0.01, 95% CI 0.002–0.02;
      p < 0.05), whereas systolic blood pressure was negatively associated with PUV
      (b = –0.06, 95% CI –0.13 to –0.001; p = 0.05). Conclusion: Echocardiographic 2D
      speckle tracking can identify subtle physiological differences in adaptations to 
      cardiac strain and twist mechanics between athletes and healthy controls.
      Differences in speckle tracking echocardiography-derived parameters can be
      identified using suitable sporting categorizations.

TI  - MalaCards: an amalgamated human disease compendium with diverse clinical and
      genetic annotation and structured search.
PG  - D877-87
AB  - The MalaCards human disease database (http://www.malacards.org/) is an integrated
      compendium of annotated diseases mined from 68 data sources. MalaCards has a web 
      card for each of ∼20 000 disease entries, in six global categories. It portrays a
      broad array of annotation topics in 15 sections, including Summaries, Symptoms,
      Anatomical Context, Drugs, Genetic Tests, Variations and Publications. The
      Aliases and Classifications section reflects an algorithm for disease name
      integration across often-conflicting sources, providing effective annotation
      consolidation. A central feature is a balanced Genes section, with scores
      reflecting the strength of disease-gene associations. This is accompanied by
      other gene-related disease information such as pathways, mouse phenotypes and
      GO-terms, stemming from MalaCards’ affiliation with the GeneCards Suite of
      databases. MalaCards’ capacity to inter-link information from complementary
      sources, along with its elaborate search function, relational database
      infrastructure and convenient data dumps, allows it to tackle its rich disease
      annotation landscape, and facilitates systems analyses and genome sequence
      interpretation. MalaCards adopts a ‘flat’ disease-card approach, but each card is
      mapped to popular hierarchical ontologies (e.g. International Classification of
      Diseases, Human Phenotype Ontology and Unified Medical Language System) and also 
      contains information about multi-level relations among diseases, thereby
      providing an optimal tool for disease representation and scrutiny.

TI  - Popular Geopolitics.
PG  - 87-113
AB  - Long derided as an inferior form of geography, there is now a recognition that if
      we want to understand geography and war, we can no longer depend on elite texts
      and elite actors. There has been an acceptance and expectation that there is some
      form of relationship between civil society and policy formation (and therefore
      decisions over war and peace) but the exact nature of this relationship has been 
      difficult to determine. A summary of attempts to better understand this through
      television, cinema, cartoons and comics will be presented. However, the case will
      be made that this does not go far enough. Accordingly, new work from Japan will
      be presented, as will a case study on the use of Twitter to show how modern
      social media break down the traditional elite/pluralist divides.

TI  - Sperm donor anonymity and compensation: an experiment with American sperm donors.
PG  - 468-88
AB  - Most sperm donation that occurs in the USA proceeds through anonymous donation.
      While some clinics make the identity of the sperm donor available to a
      donor-conceived child at age 18 as part of ‘open identification’ or ‘identity
      release programs,’ no US law requires clinics to do so, and the majority of
      individuals do not use these programs. By contrast, in many parts of the world,
      there have been significant legislative initiatives requiring that sperm donor
      identities be made available to children after a certain age (typically when the 
      child turns 18). One major concern with prohibiting anonymous sperm donation has 
      been that the number of willing sperm donors will decrease leading to shortages, 
      as have been experienced in some of the countries that have prohibited sperm
      donor anonymity. One possible solution, suggested by prior work, would be to pay 
      current anonymous sperm donors more per donation to continue to donate when their
      anonymity is removed. Using a unique sample of current anonymous and open
      identity sperm donors from a large sperm bank in the USA, we test that approach. 
      As far as we know, this is the first attempt to examine what would happen if the 
      USA adopted a prohibition on anonymous sperm donation that used the most
      ecologically valid population, current sperm donors. We find that 29% of current 
      anonymous sperm donors in the sample would refuse to donate if the law changed
      such that they were required to put their names in a registry available to
      donor-conceived children at age 18. When we look at the remaining sperm donors
      who would be willing to participate, we find that they would demand an additional
      $60 per donation (using our preferred specification). We also discuss the
      ramifications for the industry.

TI  - Beneficial and limiting factors for return to work following anterior cruciate
      ligament reconstruction: a retrospective cohort study.
PG  - 155-66
AB  - Purpose: Evidence-based advice for return to work (RTW) after anterior cruciate
      ligament (ACL) reconstruction is not available. Therefore, the objectives of this
      study were to determine when patients achieve full RTW, and to explore the
      beneficial and limiting factors for fully RTW after ACL reconstruction. Methods: 
      A retrospective cohort study was performed after ACL reconstruction among 185
      patients in one hospital. Data from patient files and a questionnaire were used
      to explore whether patient-, injury-, surgery-, sports-, work- and
      rehabilitation-related factors are beneficial or limiting for fully RTW after ACL
      reconstruction, using a backward stepwise logistic regression analysis. Results: 
      Of the 125 (68%) patients that returned the questionnaire, 36 were not part of
      the working population. Of the remaining 89 patients, 82 patients (92%) had
      returned fully to work at follow-up. The median time to fully RTW was 78 days. In
      the final regression model, which explained 29% of the variance, a significant OR
      of 5.4 (90% CI 2.2–13.1) for RTW > 78 days was observed for patients performing
      heavy knee-demanding work compared to patients performing light knee-demanding
      work. In addition, a significant and positive OR (1.6, 90% CI 1.2–1.9) for the
      number of weeks walking with the aid of crutches for RTW > 78 days was observed
      in the final model. Conclusion: After ACL reconstruction, 92% of the patients
      fully return to work at a median time of 78 days. The significant predictors for 
      fully RTW > 78 days are performing heavy knee-demanding work and a longer period 
      of walking aided with crutches after ACL reconstruction.

TI  - Movement Demands of Elite Under-20s and Senior International Rugby Union Players.
LID - e0164990
AB  - This study compared the movement demands of elite international Under-20 age
      grade (U20s) and senior international rugby union players during competitive
      tournament match play. Forty elite professional players from an U20 and 27 elite 
      professional senior players from international performance squads were monitored 
      using 10Hz global positioning systems (GPS) during 15 (U20s) and 8 (senior)
      international tournament matches during the 2014 and 2015 seasons. Data on
      distances, velocities, accelerations, decelerations, high metabolic load (HML)
      distance and efforts, and number of sprints were derived. Data files from players
      who played over 60 min (n = 258) were separated firstly into Forwards and Backs, 
      and more specifically into six positional groups; FR–Front Row (prop & hooker),
      SR–Second Row, BR–Back Row (Flankers & No.8), HB–Half Backs (scrum half & outside
      half), MF–Midfield (centres), B3 –Back Three (wings & full back) for match
      analysis. Linear mixed models revealed significant differences between U20 and
      senior teams in both the forwards and backs. In the forwards the seniors covered 
      greater HML distance (736.4 ± 280.3 vs 701.3 ± 198.7m, p = 0.01) and severe
      decelerations (2.38 ± 2.2 vs 2.28 ± 1.65, p = 0.05) compared to the U20s, but
      performed less relative HSR (3.1 ± 1.6 vs 3.2 ± 1.5, p < 0.01), moderate (19.4 ± 
      10.5 vs 23.6 ± 10.5, p = 0.01) and high accelerations (2.2 ± 1.9 vs 4.3 ± 2.7, p 
      < 0.01) and sprint•min-1 (0.11 ± 0.06 vs 0.11 ± 0.05, p < 0.01). Senior backs
      covered a greater relative distance (73.3 ± 8.1 vs 69.1 ± 7.6 m•min-1, p < 0.01),
      greater High Metabolic Load (HML) distance (1138.0 ± 233.5 vs 1060.4 ± 218.1m, p 
      < 0.01), HML efforts (112.7 ± 22.2 vs 98.8 ± 21.7, p < 0.01) and heavy
      decelerations (9.9 ± 4.3 vs 9.5 ± 4.4, p = 0.04) than the U20s backs. However,
      the U20s backs performed more relative HSR (7.3 ± 2.1 vs 7.2 ± 2.1, p <0.01) and 
      sprint•min-1 (0.26 ± 0.07 vs 0.25 ± 0.07, p < 0.01). Further investigation
      highlighted differences between the 6 positional groups of the teams. The
      positional groups that differed the most on the variables measured were the FR
      and MF groups, with the U20s FR having higher outputs on HSR, moderate & high
      accelerations, moderate, high & severe decelerations, HML distance, HML efforts, 
      and sprints•min-1. For the MF group the senior players produced greater values
      for relative distance covered, HSR, moderate decelerations, HML distance and
      sprint•min-1. The BR position group was most similar with the only differences
      seen on heavy accelerations (U20s higher) and moderate decelerations (seniors
      higher). Findings demonstrate that U20s internationals appear to be an adequate
      ‘stepping stone’ for preparing players for movement characteristics found senior 
      International rugby, however, the current study highlight for the first time that
      certain positional groups may require more time to be able to match the movement 
      demands required at a higher playing level than others. Conditioning staff must
      also bear in mind that the U20s players whilst maintaining or improving match
      movement capabilities may require to gain substantial mass in some positions to
      match their senior counterparts.

TI  - Migration, Knowledge Transfer, and the Emergence of Australian Post-War Skiing:
      The Story of Charles William Anton.
PG  - 2006-25
AB  - Skiing underwent substantial changes during the post-war years when the sport
      turned into a multi-billion dollar industry and a leisure activity for the
      masses. Despite its global nature and popularity, skiing in academic writing has 
      not gained much recognition. This paper explores the role of knowledge transfer
      during the pioneering phase of post-war skiing in Australia. It describes the
      life of Charles William Anton, an Austrian refugee from the Anschluss who
      migrated to Sydney and subsequently became one of the founding fathers of
      Australian post-war skiing. The following pages show the multi-layered nature of 
      skiing as a global sport by exemplifying how ideas spread from pre-war Europe to 
      post-war Australia. The paper will also provide a case study about refugee
      knowledge transfer and the ‘productive process of absorption, adoption or
      rejection of knowledge’ that takes place once an idea has been introduced into a 
      new environment.

TI  - What works for wellbeing in culture and sport? Report of a DELPHI process to
      support coproduction and establish principles and parameters of an evidence
      review.
PG  - 281-8
AB  - Aims:: There is a growing recognition of the ways in which culture and sport can 
      contribute to wellbeing. A strong evidence base is needed to support innovative
      service development and a 3-year research programme is being undertaken to
      capture best evidence of wellbeing impacts and outcomes of cultural and sporting 
      activities in order to inform UK policy and practice. This article provides an
      overview of methods and findings from an initial coproduction process with key
      stakeholders that sought to explore and agree principles and parameters of the
      evidence review for culture, sport and wellbeing (CSW). Methods:: A two-stage
      DELPHI process was conducted with a purposeful sample of 57 stakeholders between 
      August and December 2015. Participants were drawn from a range of culture and
      sport organisations and included commissioners and managers, policy makers,
      representatives of service delivery organisations (SDOs) and scholars. The DELPHI
      1 questionnaire was developed from extensive consultation in July and August
      2015. It explored definitions of wellbeing, the role of evidence, quality
      assessment, and the culture and sport populations, settings and interventions
      that are most likely to deliver wellbeing outcomes. Following further
      consultation, the results, presented as a series of ranked statements, were sent 
      back to participants (DELPHI 2), which allowed them to reflect on and, if they
      wished, express agreement or disagreement with the emerging consensus. Results:: 
      A total of 40 stakeholders (70.02%) responded to the DELPHI questionnaires.
      DELPHI 1 mapped areas of agreement and disagreement, confirmed in DELPHI 2. The
      exercise drew together the key priorities for the CSW evidence review.
      Conclusion:: The DELPHI process, in combination with face-to-face deliberation,
      enabled stakeholders to engage in complex discussion and express nuanced
      priorities while also allowing the group to come to an overall consensus and
      agree outcomes. The results will inform the CSW evidence review programme until
      its completion in March 2018.
