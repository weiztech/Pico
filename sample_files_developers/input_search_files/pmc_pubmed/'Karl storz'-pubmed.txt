AB  - Chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM) is a most common pathology among all
      other ENT diseases that accounts for approximately 48% of the total number of
      their cases. Modern surgery witnesses the advent of new methods for the
      management of these conditions in parallel with the modification of the known
      techniques intended to improve the post-operative outcomes of the treatment and
      rehabilitation of the patients. The objective of the present study was to enhance
      the effectiveness of the surgical treatment of the patients presenting with
      chronic suppurative otitis media by making use of the relevant navigation
      systems. A total of 29 patients presenting with CSOM underwent the surgical
      intervention on 31 ears. The open variant of sanation surgery on the middle ear
      was chosen including the hearing-improving component or without it depending on
      the extension of the pathological process under control of the Navigation Panel
      Unit ('Karl Storz', Germany) and KICK ('BrainLab', Gerfmany) navigation systems. 
      Special emphasis is placed on the selected peculiar features of their
      application. It was shown that the use of the aforementioned navigation systems
      considerably improved the field of vision and the orientation in all compartments
      of the middle ear which made it possible to prevent the potential intra-operative
      (in all 31 cases) and post-operative complications. None of the patients suffered
      complications within 2 months after the onset of the treatment. The
      microotoscopice examination revealed the signs of the inflammatory process in
      three patients 6 months after surgery. Only one patient was suspected to have a
      recurrent cholesteatoma 12 months after the surgical intervention. The second
      operation included the removal of the cholesteatoma pearl, revision of the
      post-operative cavity, and re-tympanoplasty. The most important positive effects 
      expected from the application of the navigation systems include the improved
      orientation in three dimensions that gives assurance to the surgeon thereby
      making his actions more accurate and precise and the reduction of the duration of
      the surgical intervention.
