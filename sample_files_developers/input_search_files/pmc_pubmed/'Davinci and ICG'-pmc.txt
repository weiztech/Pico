TI  - Meta-analysis Comparing Fluorescence Imaging with Radioisotope and Blue
      Dye-Guided Sentinel Node Identification for Breast Cancer Surgery.
PG  - 3738-48
AB  - Introduction: Conventional methods for axillary sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB)
      are fraught with complications such as allergic reactions, skin tattooing,
      radiation, and limitations on infrastructure. A novel technique has been
      developed for lymphatic mapping utilizing fluorescence imaging. This
      meta-analysis aims to compare the gold standard blue dye and radioisotope (BD-RI)
      technique with fluorescence-guided SLNB using indocyanine green (ICG). Methods:
      This study was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42019129224). The MEDLINE, EMBASE,
      Scopus, and Web of Science databases were searched using the Medical Subject
      Heading (MESH) terms ‘Surgery’ AND ‘Lymph node’ AND ‘Near infrared fluorescence’ 
      AND ‘Indocyanine green’. Studies containing raw data on the sentinel node
      identification rate in breast cancer surgery were included. A heterogeneity test 
      (using Cochran’s Q) determined the use of fixed- or random-effects models for
      pooled odds ratios (OR). Results: Overall, 1748 studies were screened, of which
      10 met the inclusion criteria for meta-analysis. ICG was equivalent to
      radioisotope (RI) at sentinel node identification (OR 2.58, 95% confidence
      interval [CI] 0.35–19.08, p < 0.05) but superior to blue dye (BD) (OR 9.07, 95%
      CI 6.73–12.23, p < 0.05). Furthermore, ICG was superior to the gold standard
      BD-RI technique (OR 4.22, 95% CI 2.17–8.20, p < 0.001). Conclusion: Fluorescence 
      imaging for axillary sentinel node identification with ICG is equivalent to the
      single technique using RI, and superior to the dual technique (RI-BD) and single 
      technique with BD. Hospitals using RI and/or BD could consider changing their
      practice to ICG given the comparable efficacy and improved safety profile, as
      well as the lesser burden on hospital infrastructure. Electronic supplementary

TI  - Near Infrared Fluorescence Imaging of Intraperitoneal Ovarian Tumors in Mice
      Using Erythrocyte-Derived Optical Nanoparticles and Spatially-Modulated
      Illumination.
LID - 2544
AB  - Simple Summary: Ovarian cancer has a greater mortality rate than all
      gynecological malignancies combined. While cytoreductive surgery remains the
      primary therapeutic approach, its success is limited by the inability to
      visualize all tumor nodules for resection. We developed light activated
      nano-sized particles derived from red blood cells as potential imaging probes for
      near infrared fluorescence imaging of tumors during cytoreductive surgery. We
      present the first demonstration of the use of these nanoparticles in conjunction 
      a spatially-modulated illumination (SMI) modality to image ovarian
      intraperitoneal tumors in mice. Our findings indicate that, at 24 h
      post-administration, these nanoparticles accumulated at higher levels in tumors
      as compared to organs, and that use of SMI enhances the image contrast. Abstract:
      Ovarian cancer is the deadliest gynecological cancer. Cytoreductive surgery to
      remove primary and intraperitoneal tumor deposits remains as the standard
      therapeutic approach. However, lack of an intraoperative image-guided approach to
      enable the visualization of all tumors can result in incomplete cytoreduction and
      recurrence. We engineered nano-sized particles derived from erythrocytes that
      encapsulate the near infrared (NIR) fluorochrome, indocyanine green, as potential
      imaging probes for tumor visualization during cytoreductive surgery. Herein, we
      present the first demonstration of the use of these nanoparticles in conjunction 
      with spatially-modulated illumination (SMI), at spatial frequencies in the range 
      of 0–0.5 mm−1, to fluorescently image intraperitoneal ovarian tumors in mice.
      Results of our animal studies suggest that the nanoparticles accumulated at
      higher levels within tumors 24 h post-intraperitoneal injection as compared to
      various other organs. We demonstrate that, under the imaging specifications
      reported here, use of these nanoparticles in conjunction with SMI enhances the
      fluorescence image contrast between intraperitoneal tumors and liver, and between
      intraperitoneal tumors and spleen by nearly 2.1, and 3.0 times, respectively, at 
      the spatial frequency of 0.2 mm−1 as compared to the contrast values at
      spatially-uniform (non-modulated) illumination. These results suggest that the
      combination of erythrocyte-derived NIR nanoparticles and structured illumination 
      provides a promising approach for intraoperative fluorescence imaging of ovarian 
      tumor nodules at enhanced contrast.

TI  - Combined use of fluorescence with a magnetic tracer and dilution effect upon
      sentinel node localization in a murine model.
PG  - 2427-33
AB  - Background: Sentinel node biopsy using radioisotope and blue dye remains a gold
      standard for axillary staging in breast cancer patients with low axillary burden.
      However, limitations in the use of radioisotopes have resulted in emergence of
      novel techniques. This is the first in vivo study to assess the feasibility of
      combining the two most common novel techniques of using a magnetic tracer and
      indocyanine green (ICG) fluorescence. Materials and methods: A total of 48 mice
      were divided into eight groups. Groups 1 and 2, the co-localization groups,
      received an injection of magnetic tracers (Resovist® and Sienna+®, respectively) 
      and ICG fluorescence; distilled water was used as the solvent of ICG. Groups 3
      and 4, the diluted injection groups, received an injection of magnetic tracers
      (Resovist and Sienna+, respectively) and saline for dilution. Groups 5, 6, and 7,
      the control groups, received magnetic tracer (Resovist, Sienna+) and ICG alone,
      respectively. Fluorescent intensity assessment and iron quantification of excised
      popliteal lymph nodes were performed. Group 1′, a co-localization group, received
      an injection of magnetic tracers (Resovist) and ICG′ fluorescence: saline was
      used as the solvent for ICG. Results: Lymphatic uptake of all tracers was
      confined to the popliteal nodes only, with co-localization confirmed in all cases
      and no significant difference in fluorescent intensity or iron content of ex vivo
      nodes between the groups (except for Group 1′). There was no impact of dilution
      on the iron content in the diluted Sienna+ group, but it significantly enhanced
      Resovist uptake (P=0.005). In addition, there was a significant difference in
      iron content (P=0.003) in Group 1′. Conclusion: The combination of a magnetic
      tracer (Resovist or Sienna+) and ICG fluorescence is feasible for sentinel node
      biopsy and will potentially allow for precise transcutaneous node identification,
      in addition to accurate intraoperative assessment. This radioisotope-free
      “combined technique” warrants further assessment within a clinical trial.

AB  - A common cause of local tumor recurrence in brain tumor surgery results from
      incomplete surgical resection. Adjunctive technologies meant to facilitate gross 
      total resection have had limited efficacy to date. Contrast agents used to
      delineate tumors pre-operatively cannot be easily or accurately used in the
      real-time operative setting. Although multimodal imaging contrast agents have
      been developed to help the surgeon discern tumor from normal tissue in the
      operating room, these contrast agents are not readily translatable. We have
      developed a novel contrast agent comprised solely of two FDA-approved components,
      indocyanine green (ICG) and superparamagnetic iron oxide (SPIO) nanoparticles -
      with no additional amphiphiles or carrier-materials, to enable pre-operative
      detection by MRI and intraoperative photoacoustic (PA) imaging. The encapsulation
      efficiency of both ICG and SPIO within the formulated clusters is ~100% and the
      total ICG payload is 20–30% of the total weight (ICG + SPIO). The ICG-SPIO
      clusters are stable in physiologic conditions, can be taken up within tumors by
      enhanced permeability and retention, and are detectable by MRI. In a pre-clinical
      surgical resection model in mice following injection of ICG-SPIO clusters,
      animals undergoing PA-guided surgery demonstrated increased progression-free
      survival compared to animals undergoing microscopic surgery.
