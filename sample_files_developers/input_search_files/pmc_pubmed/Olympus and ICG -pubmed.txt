AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe the incidence of adverse reactions to indocyanine green
      (ICG) administered during sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy for endometrial
      cancer, and to propose an ICG management algorithm for these patients. METHODS:
      All patients who underwent surgery for endometrial cancer with SLN biopsy using
      ICG from 1/2017 to 8/2020 were identified using a single-institution prospective 
      database. Surgical adverse events (SAEs) related to the procedure were
      identified. A review of the literature was performed. RESULTS: In all, 1414
      patients met inclusion criteria and were evaluated. Sixty-seven (4.7%) patients
      had a history of either an iodine or contrast allergy. No patients had a history 
      of documented ICG allergy. Among patients with an iodine or contrast allergy, 65 
      (97%) received a corticosteroid with or without diphenhydramine prior to ICG
      administration. One hundred five patients (7.4%) experienced 116 SAEs. Among
      these patients, 3 experienced potentially allergic SAEs possibly related to ICG
      administration. After thorough chart review, however, the likelihood these SAEs
      were due to ICG appeared low. No patients experienced an anaphylactic response
      after ICG admission. CONCLUSION: There were no anaphylactic reactions to ICG
      intracervical administration during 1414 consecutive SLN biopsies, including in
      patients with a documented iodine or contrast allergy. Intracervical injection of
      ICG is safe, and premedication using corticosteroids with or without
      diphenhydramine prior to SLN biopsy is a reasonable strategy in patients with
      iodinated contrast allergy.

TI  - First-in-Human Clinical Experience Using High-Definition Exoscope with
      Intraoperative Indocyanine Green for Clip Reconstruction of Unruptured Large
      Pediatric Aneurysm.

AB  - The operative exoscope is a novel tool that combines the benefits of surgical
      microscopes and endoscopes to yield excellent magnification and illumination
      while maintaining a comparatively small footprint and superior ergonomic
      features. Until recently, current exoscopes have been limited by 2-dimensional
      viewing; however, recently a 3-dimensional (3D), high-definition (4K-HD) exoscope
      has been developed (Sony-Olympus, Tokyo, Japan).(1) Our group had previously
      described the first in-human experiences with this novel tool including
      microsurgical clipping of intracranial aneurysms. We have highlighted the
      benefits of the exoscope, which include providing an immersive experience for
      surgeons and trainees, as well as superior ergonomics as compared with
      traditional microsurgery.(2) To date, exoscopic 3D high-definition indocyanine
      green (ICG) video angiography (ICG-VA) has not been described. ICG-VA, now a
      mainstay of vascular microsurgery, uses intravenously injected dye to visualize
      intravascular fluorescence in real time to assess the patency of arteries and
      assess clip occlusion of aneurysms.(3)(,)(4) The ability to safely couple this
      tool with the novel exoscope has the potential to advance cerebrovascular
      microsurgery. Here, we present a case of a 11-year-old male with Alagille
      syndrome, pancytopenia, and peripheral pulmonary stenosis found to have a 12 x 13
      x 7 mm distal left M1 aneurysm arising from the inferior M1/M2 junction. The
      patient was neurologically intact without evidence of rupture. In order to
      prevent catastrophic rupture, the decision was made to treat the lesion. Due to
      the patients underlying medical conditions including baseline coagulopathy,
      surgical management was felt to be superior to an endovascular reconstruction,
      which would require long-term antiplatelet therapy. Thus the patient underwent a 
      left-sided pterional craniotomy with exoscopic 3D ICG-VA. As demonstrated in
      Video 1, ICG-VA was performed before definitive clip placement in order to
      understand flow dynamics with particular emphasis on understanding the middle
      cerebral artery outflow. Postoperatively, the patient remained at his neurologic 
      baseline and subsequent imaging demonstrated complete obliteration of the
      aneurysm without any neck remnant. The patient continues to follow and remains
      asymptomatic and neurologically intact without radiographic evidence of residual 
      or recurrence.

TI  - A new method for accurately localizing and resecting pulmonary nodules.
PG  - 4973-4984
LID - 10.21037/jtd-20-2089 [doi]
AB  - With the use of low-dose CT for early screening of lung cancer, more and more
      early lung cancers are found. At the same time, patients with small lung nodules 
      have also increased, it is a great challenge for surgeons to resect pulmonary
      nodules with small volume, deep position and no solid components under
      video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery. Many studies have reported preoperative and
      intraoperative methods for localizing lung nodules before minimally invasive
      resection. Methods for preoperative localization include CT-guided hook-wire
      positioning, coil positioning, or dye injection and radionuclide location Methods
      for intraoperative localization include intraoperative ultrasound localization
      and tactile pressure-sensing localization. After the localization of pulmonary
      nodules under the guidance of CT patients need to restrict their activities;
      otherwise, it is easy for the nodules to move, causing the operation to fail, and
      may also cause complications such as pneumothorax, puncture site pain, and
      pulmonary parenchymal bleeding. In the past, we injected melamine dye under the
      guidance of electromagnetic navigation bronchoscope to locate lung nodules. The
      purpose of this case is introducing a new method for accurately localizing and
      resecting pulmonary nodules by injecting indocyanine green (ICG) under the
      guidance of electromagnetic navigation bronchoscope and the resection of small
      pulmonary nodules under the fluoroscope.

TI  - Evolution and outcomes of sentinel lymph node mapping in vulvar cancer.
PG  - 383-386
LID - 10.1136/ijgc-2019-000936 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To characterize our institutional experience with sentinel lymph node
      (SLN) biopsy in patients with vulvar cancer. We describe the oncologic outcomes
      of these patients and the utilization of SLN detection techniques over time.
      METHODS: A retrospective analysis of all patients who underwent inguinofemoral
      SLN biopsy as part of their treatment for vulvar cancer at Memorial Sloan
      Kettering Cancer Center from January 1, 2000 to April 1, 2019. Patients were
      included in this analysis if they underwent inguinofemoral SLN biopsy for vulvar 
      cancer, irrespective of presenting factors such as histology, tumor size or
      laterality. An "at-risk groin" was defined as either the right or left groin for 
      which SLN biopsy of inguinofemoral lymph nodes was performed. RESULTS: A total of
      160 patients were included in our analysis, representing 265 at-risk groins. 114 
      patients had squamous cell histology representing 195 at-risk groins. Of the 169 
      negative groins in patients with squamous cell carcinoma, the 2 year isolated
      groin recurrence rate was 1.2%. SLN detection rate, irrespective of modality, was
      96.2%. Technetium-99 (TC-99) + blue dye detected SLNs in 91.8% of groins; TC-99 +
      indocyanine green detected SLNs in 100% of groins (p=0.157). Among the 110 groins
      that underwent mapping with TC-99 and blue dye, 4 patients had failed mapping
      with blue dye and mapped with TC-99 alone (3.6%). Among the 96 groins that
      underwent mapping with TC-99 and ICG, 14 patients failed to map with TC-99 and
      mapped with indocyanine green alone (14.6%). CONCLUSIONS: SLN mapping in vulvar
      cancer is reliable and oncologically effective. The utilization of indocyanine
      green for mapping has increased over the past decade and is associated with high 
      rates of SLN detection.

TI  - Fluorescent imaging using indocyanine green during esophagectomy to prevent
      surgical morbidity: a systematic review and meta-analysis.
PG  - S755-S765

AB  - Background: Fluorescent imaging using indocyanine green (ICG) is an emerging
      technique that aids the surgeon with intraoperative decision making during upper 
      gastrointestinal cancer surgery. In this systematic review we aim to provide an
      overview of current practice of fluorescence imaging using ICG during
      esophagectomy, and to show how this technology can prevent surgical morbidity,
      such as anastomotic leakage, graft necrosis and chylothorax. Methods: The PRISMA 
      standard for systematic reviews was used. The PubMed and Embase database were
      searched to identify articles matching our systematic literature search. Two
      authors screened all included articles for eligibility. Risk of bias was assessed
      for all included articles. Results: A total of 25 articles were included in this 
      review: 22 articles on perfusion assessment, and three on the detection of chyle 
      fistula. Five out of 22 articles concerning perfusion assessment evaluated
      fluorescence signals in quantitative values. In 20 articles the pooled incidence 
      of anastomotic leakage and graft necrosis in the ICG group was 11.10% (95% CI:
      8.06-15.09%) and in eight studies the pooled change in management rate was 24.55%
      (95% CI: 19.16-30.88%). After change in management, the pooled incidence of
      anastomotic leakage and graft necrosis was 14.08% (95% CI: 6.55-27.70%). A
      meta-analysis showed that less anastomotic leakages and graft necrosis occur in
      the ICG group (OR 0.30, 95% CI: 0.14-0.63). Three case-reports (N=3) were
      identified regarding chyle fistula detection, and ICG lymphography detected the
      thoracic duct in all cases and the chyle fistula in one case. Conclusions:
      Fluorescence imaging using ICG is a promising and safe technology to reduce
      surgical morbidity after esophagectomy with continuity restoration. ICG
      fluorescence angiography showed a reduction in anastomotic leakage and graft
      necrosis. Future studies are needed to demonstrate the feasibility of ICG
      lymphography for chyle fistula detection.

TI  - Indocyanine green-based fluorescence imaging in visceral and hepatobiliary and
      pancreatic surgery: State of the art and future directions.
PG  - 2921-2930
LID - 10.3748/wjg.v24.i27.2921 [doi]
AB  - In recent years, the use of fluorescence-guided surgery (FGS) to treat benign and
      malignant visceral, hepatobiliary and pancreatic neoplasms has significantly
      increased. FGS relies on the fluorescence signal emitted by injected substances
      (fluorophores) after being illuminated by ad hoc laser sources to help guide the 
      surgical procedure and provide the surgeon with real-time visualization of the
      fluorescent structures of interest that would be otherwise invisible. This review
      surveys and discusses the most common and emerging clinical applications of
      indocyanine green (ICG)-based fluorescence in visceral, hepatobiliary and
      pancreatic surgery. The analysis, findings, and discussion presented here rely on
      the authors' significant experience with this technique in their medical
      institutions, an up-to-date review of the most relevant articles published on
      this topic between 2014 and 2018, and lengthy discussions with key opinion
      leaders in the field during recent conferences and congresses. For each
      application, the benefits and limitations of this technique, as well as
      applicable future directions, are described. The imaging of fluorescence emitted 
      by ICG is a simple, fast, relatively inexpensive, and harmless tool with numerous
      different applications in surgery for both neoplasms and benign pathologies of
      the visceral and hepatobiliary systems. The ever-increasing availability of
      visual systems that can utilize this tool will transform some of these
      applications into the standard of care in the near future. Further studies are
      needed to evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of each application of ICG-based 
      fluorescence imaging in abdominal surgery.

TI  - Fluorescence of Deep Infiltrating Endometriosis During Laparoscopic Surgery: A
      Preliminary Report on 6 Cases.
PG  - 450-454
LID - 10.1177/1553350618785486 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The standard treatment of rectovaginal deep infiltrating
      endometriosis nodules (RVDIEN) consists in their surgical removal. RVDIEN are
      anatomically neovascularized. Indocyanine green (ICG) reveals vascularized
      structures when becoming fluorescent after exposure to near-infrared (NIR) light.
      This study aims to evaluate if fluorescence-guided surgery can improve the
      laparoscopic resection of RVDIEN, thus avoiding a rectal perforation. MATERIALS
      AND METHODS: Patients with a symptomatic RVDIEN, scheduled for a laparoscopic
      rectal shaving, were enrolled in the study. Technically, the RVDIEN was targeted 
      and removed with the help of the NIR imager device Image 1 Spies (Karl Storz GmBH
      & Co KG, Tuttlingen, Germany) or Visera Elite II (Olympus Europe SE & Co KG,
      Hamburg, Germany), after an intraoperative, intravenous injection of ICG (0.25
      mg/kg). RESULTS: Six patients underwent a fluorescence-guided laparoscopic
      shaving procedure for the treatment of a nonobstructive RVDIEN. Fluorescence of
      the RVDIEN was observed in all the patients. In one patient, once the main lesion
      was removed, the posterior vaginal fornix still appeared fluorescent and was
      removed. No intraoperative rectal perforation occurred. The postoperative
      hospital stay was 2 days. No postoperative rectovaginal fistula occurred within a
      median follow-up of 16 months (range = 2-23 months). CONCLUSION: In this
      preliminary study, fluorescence-guided laparoscopy appeared to help in separating
      the RVDIEN from the healthy rectal tissue, without rectal perforation. Moreover, 
      this technique was helpful in deciding if the resection needed to be enlarged to 
      the posterior vaginal fornix.

AB  - Fluorescence tumor imaging using exogenous fluorescent tumor-targeting agents has
      potential to improve early tumor detection. The fluorescent contrast agent
      indocyanine green (ICG) is used in medical diagnostics. The aim of the present
      study is to investigate the tumor imaging capability and the imaging mechanism of
      i.v. administered ICG in a mouse model of colitis-associated colon cancer. To do 
      this, an azoxymethane/dextran sodium sulfate-induced colon cancer mouse model was
      used. Ex vivo imaging experiments were carried out 1 hour after i.v. injection of
      ICG. The ICG fluorescence was observed in the colon tumor tissues, with
      sufficient tumor to normal tissue ratio, correlating with tumor malignancy. In
      the tumor tissues, ICG fluorescence was localized in the vascular interstitial
      tissue. Immunofluorescence microscopy revealed that tumor cells formed tight
      junctions normally, suggesting an inability of tumor cellular uptake of ICG. In
      contrast, tumor tissues increased the CD31-immunoreactive endothelial cell area, 
      and accumulated stromal cells immunoreactive for COX-2 and tumor cell population 
      immunoreactive for inducible nitric oxide synthase. In vivo vascular permeability
      assay revealed that prostaglandin E2 promoted the endothelial cell permeability
      of ICG. In conclusion, our data indicated that fluorescence contrast-enhanced
      imaging following i.v. administered ICG can be applied to the detection of colon 
      tumors in a mouse colitis-associated colon cancer model. The tumor tissue
      preference of ICG in the present model can be attributed to the enhanced vascular
      leakage of ICG involving inflammatory mediators, such as COX-2 and inducible
      nitric oxide synthase, in conjunction with increased tumor vascularity.

LID - 10.18632/oncotarget.21744 [doi]
AB  - The fluorescent contrast agent indocyanine green (ICG) is approved by the Food
      and Drug Administration for clinical applications. We previously reported that
      cultured human colon tumor cells preferentially take up ICG by endocytic activity
      in association with disruption of their tight junctions. The present study
      explored ICG availability in fluorescence imaging of the colon to identify
      proliferative lesions during colonoscopy. The cellular uptake of ICG in cultured 
      rat colon tumor cells was examined using live-cell imaging. Colon lesions in rats
      administered an ICG-containing enema were further assessed in rats with
      azoxymethane-induced colon carcinogenesis, using in vivo endoscopy, ex vivo
      microscopy, and immunofluorescence microscopy. The uptake of ICG by the cultured 
      cells was temperature-dependent. The intracellular retention of the dye in the
      membrane trafficking system suggested endocytosis as the uptake mechanism. ICG
      administered via enema accumulated in colon proliferative lesions ranging from
      tiny aberrant crypt foci to adenomas and localized in proliferating cells.
      Fluorescence endoscopy detected these ICG-positive colonic proliferative lesions 
      in vivo. The immunoreactivity of the tight-junction molecule occludin was altered
      in the proliferative lesions, suggesting the disruption of the integrity of tight
      junctions. These results suggest that fluorescence contrast-enhanced imaging
      following the administration of an ICG-containing enema can enhance the detection
      of mucosal proliferative lesions of the colon during colonoscopy. The tissue
      preference of ICG in the rat model evaluated in this study can be attributed to
      the disruption of tight junctions, which in turn promotes endocytosis by
      proliferative cells and the cellular uptake of ICG.
