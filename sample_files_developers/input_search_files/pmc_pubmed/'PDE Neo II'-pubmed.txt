TI  - T-DM1 versus pertuzumab, trastuzumab and a taxane as first-line therapy of
      early-relapsed HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer: an Italian multicenter
      observational study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The current standard first-line treatment of human epidermal growth
      factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive (+) metastatic breast cancer is the combination
      of pertuzumab, trastuzumab and a taxane (P + T + taxane), while standard
      second-line is ado-trastuzumab-emtansine (T-DM1). The registration trial of
      pertuzumab, however, did not include early-relapsing patients, defined as
      patients experiencing tumor relapse </=12 months from the end of (neo)adjuvant
      anti-HER2 therapy. Conversely, the pivotal trial of T-DM1 included some patients 
      relapsing </=6 months after the end of (neo)adjuvant trastuzumab. Thus, a
      proportion of early-relapsing patients are currently eligible to receive T-DM1 as
      first-line treatment. Nevertheless, no direct comparison exists between the two
      regimens in this clinical setting. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively
      compared T-DM1 versus P + T + taxane as first-line treatment in two cohorts of
      early-relapsing patients in an Italian 'real-world' setting, involving 14 public 
      health care institutions. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival.
      Secondary endpoints included patients' characterization, overall survival and
      post-progression survival. Univariate and multivariate analyses were carried out.
      All tests were two-sided and a P </= 0.05 was considered statistically
      significant. RESULTS: Among 1252 screened patients, 75 met the inclusion
      criteria. Forty-four (58.7%) received P + T + taxane and 31 (41.3%) received
      T-DM1. The two cohorts showed similar characteristics of aggressiveness and no
      significant differences in treatment history. T-DM1, compared with P + T + taxane
      was associated with worse progression-free survival (adjusted hazard ratio: 2.26,
      95% confidence interval: 1.13-4.52, P = 0.021) and overall survival (adjusted
      hazard ratio: 3.95, 95% confidence interval: 1.38-11.32, P = 0.010), irrespective
      of previous (neo)adjuvant treatment, age, hormone receptors status,
      time-to-relapse (</=6 months or within 6-12 months) and presence of
      visceral/brain metastases. No differences were observed in post-progression
      survival (P = 0.095). CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests superiority for P + T +
      taxane over T-DM1 as up-front treatment of early-relapsing HER2+ metastatic
      breast cancer, which merits further assessment in larger and prospective trials.

TI  - Genetics, diagnosis and treatment of Lynch syndrome: Old lessons and current
      challenges.
PG  - 3048-3054
LID - 10.3892/ol.2019.9945 [doi]
AB  - Lynch syndrome (LS) is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder associated with
      germline mutations in DNA mismatch repair (MMR) genes. The carriers of pathogenic
      mutations in these genes have an increased risk of developing a colorectal cancer
      and/or LS-associated cancer. The LS-associated cancer types include carcinomas of
      the endometrium, small intestine, stomach, pancreas and biliary tract, ovary,
      brain, upper urinary tract and skin. The criteria for the clinical diagnosis of
      LS and the procedures of the genetic testing for identification of pathogenetic
      mutations carriers in MMR genes have long been known. A crucial point in the
      mutation detection analysis is the correct definition of the pathogenecity
      associated with MMR genetic variants, especially in order to include the mutation
      carriers in the endoscopy surveillance programs more suited to them. Therefore,
      this may help to improve the LS-associated cancer prevention programs. In the
      present review, we also report the recent discoveries in molecular genetics of
      LS, such as the new roles of MMR protein and immune response of MMR repair
      deficiency in colorectal cancer. Finally, we discuss the main therapeutic
      approaches, including immunotherapy, which represent a valid alternative to
      traditional therapeutic methods and extend the life expectancy of patients that
      have already developed LS-associated colorectal cancer.

TI  - Assessing response to neo-adjuvant therapy in locally advanced rectal cancer
      using Intra-voxel Incoherent Motion modelling by DWI data and Standardized Index 
      of Shape from DCE-MRI.
PG  - 1758835918809875
LID - 10.1177/1758835918809875 [doi]
AB  - Background: Our aim was to investigate preoperative chemoradiation therapy (pCRT)
      response in locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC) comparing standardized index of
      shape (SIS) obtained from dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging
      (DCE-MRI) with intravoxel-incoherent-motion-modelling-derived parameters by
      diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI). Materials and methods: Eighty-eight patients
      with LARC were subjected to MRI before and after pCRT. Apparent diffusion
      coefficient (ADC), tissue diffusion (Dt), pseudodiffusion (Dp) and perfusion
      fraction (f) were calculated and percentage changes ADC, Dt, Dp, f were computed.
      SIS was derived comparing DCE-MRI pre- and post-pCRT. Nonparametric tests and
      receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were performed. Results: A total
      of 52 patients were classified as responders (tumour regression grade; TRG 2) and
      36 as not-responders (TRG > 3). Mann-Whitney U test showed statistically
      significant differences in SIS, ADC and Dt between responders and not-responders 
      and between complete responders (19 patients with TRG = 1) versus incomplete
      responders. The best parameters to discriminate responders by nonresponders were 
      SIS and ADC, with an accuracy of 91% and 82% (cutoffs of -5.2% and 18.7%,
      respectively); the best parameters to detect pathological complete responders
      were SIS, f and Dp with an accuracy of 78% (cutoffs of 38.5%, 60.0% and 83.0%,
      respectively). No increase of performance was observed by combining linearly each
      possible couple of parameters or combining all parameters. Conclusion: SIS allows
      assessment of preoperative treatment response with high accuracy guiding the
      surgeon versus more or less conservative treatment. DWI-derived parameters
      reached less accuracy compared with SIS and combining linearly DCE- and
      DWI-derived parameters; no increase of accuracy was obtained.

TI  - Expression and clinical implication of cyclooxygenase-2 and E-cadherin in oral
      squamous cell carcinomas.
PG  - 667-674
LID - 10.1080/15384047.2015.1071741 [doi]
AB  - Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT) and angiogenesis are crucial events for
      development of aggressive and often fatal Oral Squamous Cell Carcinomas (OSCCs). 
      Both promote cancer progression and metastasis development, but while the former 
      induces the loss of E-cadherin expression and, hence cadherin switching; the
      latter produces hematic blood vessel neo-formation and contribute to OSCC cell
      growth, tumor mass development, and dissemination. Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) has
      an important role, not only in angiogenic mechanisms, but also in favoring cancer
      invasion. Indeed it decreases the expression of E-cadherin and leads to
      phenotypic changes in epithelial cells (EMT) enhancing their carcinogenic
      potential. Our aim is to evaluate the interplay between E-cadherin cytoplasmic
      delocalization, COX-2 up-regulation and COX-2 induced neo-angiogenesis in 120
      cases of OSCC. We have analyzed the distribution and the number of neo-formed
      endothelial buds surrounding infiltrating cells that express COX-2, as well as
      the neo-formed vessels in chronic inflammatory infiltrate, which surround the
      tumor. A double immunostaining method was employed in order to verify
      co-localization of endothelial cell marker (CD34) and COX-2. IHC has also been
      used to assess E-cadherin expression. Our data demonstrate that the OSCC cells,
      which lose membranous E-cadherin staining, acquiring a cytoplasmic
      delocalization, overexpress COX-2. Moreover, we find a new CD34+ vessel formation
      (sprouting angiogenesis). Only basaloid type of OSCC showes low level of COX-2
      expression together with very low level of neo-angiogenesis and consequent tumor 
      necrosis. The well-known anti-metastatic effect of certain COX-2 inhibitors
      suggests that these molecules might have clinical utility in the management of
      advanced cancers.
