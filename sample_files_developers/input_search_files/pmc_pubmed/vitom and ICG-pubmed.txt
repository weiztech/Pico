AB  - PURPOSE: The usage of radioactive Technetium(99m) (Tc(99m)) colloid for the
      purpose of sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) in early breast cancer is considered
      the gold standard in Germany. However, new tracers, such as near-infrared (NIR)
      imaging agents like indocyanine green (ICG) could offer an alternative in future,
      as they overcome drawbacks associated with radioactive Technetium(99m) (Tc(99m)) 
      like limited availability, high costs and radioactivity exposure for both
      patients and surgeons. METHODS: In this double-arm retrospective study, we sought
      to establish the usefulness of indocyanine green as an alternative or an addition
      to the conventional Technetium(99m) (Tc(99m)) in the identification of the SLN in
      early breast cancer. RESULTS: Among the 161 patients who underwent primary SLNB, 
      34 patients had at least 1 SLN with metastasis. Among these patients with SLN
      metastasis, 33 had the SLN detected by ICG; while 31 had the SLN detected by
      Tc(99m). The conventional Technetium(99m) radiotracer failed to detect 2 patients
      with metastasis in this Arm of the study. Among the 87 patients who underwent
      SLNB after NACT, 13 patients had at least 1 SLN with metastasis. Among these 13
      patients with SLN metastasis, ICG and Tc(99m) had detected the SLN among 12
      patients, while 1 patient had been detected by ICG alone. CONCLUSIONS: Our
      results show that ICG is as effective as the radioisotope for SLNB even among
      patients who have undergone NACT. This trial is registered with the German
      Clinical Trial Register, ID: DRKS00013606.

AB  - Currently, the use of radioisotope and blue dye for sentinel lymph node biopsy
      (SLNB) for axillary staging in breast cancer is common. Recently, indocyanine
      green (ICG) has been proposed as an alternative sentinel lymph node (SLN)
      tracking agent. We evaluated the clinical value of ICG as an additional tracer in
      combination with Technetium(99m) and as an alternative to Technetium(99m) for the
      identification of SLN in 104 breast cancer patients. 21 patients had at least 1
      histologically tumor-positive SLN. All 21 patients were detected by ICG; in one
      of these 21 sentinel-positive patients, Technetium(99m) was unable to identify
      lymph node involvement. Our results show that ICG is as effective as the
      radioisotope for SLNB. In addition, as a near-infrared dye, it has the advantages
      of real-time visualization, lower cost, and wider availability, since no
      radioactive material needs to be handled. This trial is registered with German
      Clinical Trial Register Main ID: DRKS00013606.
