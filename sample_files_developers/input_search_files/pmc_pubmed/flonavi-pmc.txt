TI  - Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone Receptor-Targeted Near-Infrared Fluorescence Probe
      for Specific Recognition and Localization of Peritoneal Metastases of Ovarian
      Cancer.
LID - 266
AB  - Background: Peritoneal dissemination is common in advanced ovarian cancer. The
      completeness of cytoreduction is an independent prognostic factor. The
      intraoperative fluorescence imaging via tumor-specific near-infrared fluorophore 
      might improve staging and surgical completeness. A promising target for ovarian
      cancer is the gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptor (GnRHR). This study aimed
      to develop a GnRHR-targeted near-infrared imaging probe for the detection of
      peritoneal metastases of ovarian cancer.Methods: Indocyanine green (ICG) was
      conjugated with GnRH antagonist peptide to develop an ovarian cancer-selective
      fluorescence probe GnRHa-ICG. GnRHR expression was detected in ovarian cancer
      tissues. The binding capacity of GnRHa-ICG and ICG was detected in both cancer
      cell lines and mouse models of peritoneal metastatic ovarian cancer using
      fluorescence microscopy, flow cytometry, and near-infrared fluorescence
      imaging.Results: Tissue microarray analysis revealed the overexpression of GnRHR 
      in ovarian cancer. GnRH-ICG exhibited the binding capacity in a panel of cancer
      cell lines with different expression levels of GnRHR. In ovarian cancer mouse
      models, GnRHa-ICG signals were detected in peritoneal tumor lesions rather than
      normal peritoneal and intestines tissues. ICG showed intensive fluorescence
      signals in intestines. The tumor-to-muscle ratio and tumor-to-intestine ratio of 
      GnRHa-ICG was 7.41 ± 2.82 and 4.37 ± 1.66, higher than that of ICG (4.60 ± 0.50
      and 0.57 ± 0.06) at 2 h post administration. The fluorescence signal of
      peritoneal metastases peaked in intensity at 2 h and maintained for up to 48 h.
      ICG also showed a weak signal in the tumor lesions due to the enhanced
      permeability and retention effect, but the intensity decreased quickly within 48 
      h.Conclusions: The developed GnRHR-targeted imaging agent GnRHa-ICG could
      specifically detected peritoneal tumor lesions from normal peritoneal and
      intestines tissues because of the modification of GnRHa to ICG. The plateau
      period of GnRHa-ICG accumulation may be feasible for clinical applications in
      fluorescence-guided surgery. Our GnRHR imaging concept may be effective in other 
      hormone-related tumors with upregulated GnRHR expression.

TI  - The safety and feasibility of intraoperative near‐infrared fluorescence imaging
      with indocyanine green in thoracoscopic sympathectomy for primary palmar
      hyperhidrosis.
PG  - 943-9
AB  - Background: We investigated the safety and feasibility of intraoperative
      near‐infrared (NIR) imaging using indocyanine green (ICG) during sympathectomy in
      the management of primary palmar hyperhidrosis (PPH). Methods: We performed a
      retrospective review of 142 patients (ICG group) who underwent endoscopic
      thoracic sympathectomy (ETS) between February 2018 and April 2019. All patients
      received a 5 mg/kg infusion of ICG 24 hours preoperatively. The vital signs
      before and after ICG injection and adverse reactions were recorded. Meanwhile,
      498 patients (Non‐ICG group) who underwent ETS by normal thoracoscopy during
      August 2017 to April 2019 were also reviewed to compare the abnormal white blood 
      cell (WBC) counts, alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST),
      blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and creatinine (Cr) levels before and after operation 
      between two groups. Results: For ICG group, the vital signs including body
      temperature, heart rate and blood pressure before and after ICG injection were
      stable. There was no significant difference in the abnormal WBC counts, ALT, AST,
      BUN, and Cr levels before and after operation between two groups. Only one
      patient had mild adverse reaction (0.7%) after ICG injection. The visibility rate
      of all sympathetic ganglions was 96.7% (1369/1415). The visibility rate from T1
      to T5 was 98.23% (278/283), 98.23% (278/283), 97.17% (275/283), 95.76% (271/283),
      and 94.35% (267/283), respectively. There was no significant difference in the
      visibility rate with regard to age, gender, height, weight, body mass index, and 
      PPH grade. Conclusions: NIR fluorescence imaging with ICG for identifying
      sympathetic ganglions is relatively safe and feasible. Key points: • Significant 
      findings of the study.NIR fluorescence imaging with ICG for identifying
      sympathetic ganglions is relatively safe and feasible.• What this study adds.This
      technology may take the place of the rib‐oriented method as standard practice for
      the precise localization of sympathetic ganglions, and may improve the effect of 
      sympathectomies.
