AB  - During courtship, male lyrebirds create acoustic illusions of a flock of birds
      fending off a predator. These realistic illusions fool the imitated species to
      engage in mobbing, but intriguingly lyrebirds produce them only preceding or
      during copulation.

AB  - In July 2016, a mummified carcass of an ancient wolf (Canis lupus) pup (specimen 
      YG 648.1) was discovered in thawing permafrost in the Klondike goldfields, near
      Dawson City, Yukon, Canada (Figure 1A). The wolf pup mummy was recovered along a 
      small tributary of Last Chance Creek during hydraulic thawing that exposed the
      permafrost sediment in which it was preserved. This mummified wolf pup is
      important to the local Tr'ondek Hwech'in people, who named it Zhur, meaning
      'wolf' in the Han language of their community. Here, we report detailed
      morphometric, isotopic, and genetic analyses of Zhur that reveal details of her
      appearance, evolutionary relationships to other wolves and short life-history and
      ecology. Zhur is the most complete wolf mummy known. She lived approximately
      57,000 years ago and died in her den during a collapse of the sediments. During
      her short life, she ate aquatic resources, and is related to ancient Beringian
      and Russian gray wolves and her clade is basal to all living gray wolves. VIDEO

TI  - When Lone Wolf Defectors Undermine the Power of the Opt-Out Default.
PG  - 8973
LID - 10.1038/s41598-020-65163-1 [doi]
AB  - High levels of cooperation are a central feature of human society, and
      conditional cooperation has been proposed as one proximal mechanism to support
      this. The counterforce of free-riding can, however, undermine cooperation and as 
      such a number of external mechanisms have been proposed to ameliorate the effects
      of free-riding. One such mechanism is setting cooperation as the default (i.e.,
      an opt-out default). We posit, however, that in dynamic settings where people can
      observe and condition their actions on others' behaviour, 'lone wolf' defectors
      undermine initial cooperation encouraged by an opt-out default, while 'good
      shepherds' defeat the free-riding encouraged by an opt-in default. Thus, we
      examine the dynamic emergence of conditional cooperation under different default 
      settings. Specifically, we develop a game theoretical model to analyse
      cooperation under defaults for cooperation (opt-out) and defection (opt-in). The 
      model predicts that the 'lone wolf' effect is stronger than the 'good shepherd'
      effect, which - if anticipated by players - should strategically deter
      free-riding under opt-out and cooperation under opt-in. Our experimental games
      confirm the existence of both 'lone wolf' defectors and 'good shepherd'
      cooperators, and that the 'lone wolf'effect is stronger in the context of organ
      donation registration behaviour. We thus show a potential 'dark side' to
      conditional cooperation ('lone wolf effect') and draw implications for the
      adoption of an opt-out organ donation policy.

TI  - Postcranial diversity and recent ecomorphic impoverishment of North American gray
      wolves.
LID - 20170613 [pii]
LID - 10.1098/rsbl.2017.0613 [doi]
AB  - Recent advances in genomics and palaeontology have begun to unravel the complex
      evolutionary history of the gray wolf, Canis lupus Still, much of their
      phenotypic variation across time and space remains to be documented. We examined 
      the limb morphology of the fossil and modern North American gray wolves from the 
      late Quaternary (<ca 70 ka) to better understand their postcranial diversity
      through time. We found that the late-Pleistocene gray wolves were characterized
      by short-leggedness on both sides of the Cordilleran-Laurentide ice sheets, and
      that this trait survived well into the Holocene despite the collapse of
      Pleistocene megafauna and disappearance of the 'Beringian wolf' from Alaska. By
      contrast, extant populations in the Midwestern USA and northwestern North America
      are distinguished by their elongate limbs with long distal segments, which appear
      to have evolved during the Holocene possibly in response to a new level or type
      of prey depletion. One of the consequences of recent extirpation of the Plains
      (Canis lupus nubilus) and Mexican wolves (C. l. baileyi) from much of the USA is 
      an unprecedented loss of postcranial diversity through removal of short-legged
      forms. Conservation of these wolves is thus critical to restoration of the
      ecophenotypic diversity and evolutionary potential of gray wolves in North
      America.
