TI  - Is high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) an option for neoadjuvant therapy for
      borderline resectable pancreatic cancer patients? - a systematic review.
PG  - 75-80
LID - 10.1080/02656736.2021.1909150 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Pancreatic cancer is with the poorest prognosis of all common
      cancers worldwide. Despite the advances in treatment the results are poor
      throughout the different methods. Pancreatic resection still yields the best
      outcome. However only a quarter of the patients present at operable stage. HIFU
      is a noninvasive technique that can be used to treat pancreatic cancer. AIM: The 
      aim of this review is to perform a systematic review on the data about the
      resection rate after HIFU ablation in patients with borderline resectable
      pancreatic cancer (BRPC) and the impact of this technique over the oncological
      results. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The PubMed and Wanfang databases were searched
      using keywords: pancreatic cancer, HIFU ablation and high-intensity focused
      ultrasound. All found articles were reviewed. The systematic review was performed
      according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and
      Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) standard guidelines. This study was financially supported 
      by 2019 'Kuan-Ren Elite' Program of 2nd Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical 
      University, China (Grant no. KY2019G019). RESULTS: The English database search
      showed 109 papers, of which 3 met the inclusion criteria. The Wanfang database
      resulted in 110 papers; however, none met the inclusion criteria of the review.
      From the included studies 97 patients underwent neoadjuvant HIFU ablation +/-
      chemotherapy. Thirty-four patients reached resection (35.1%). In two patients,
      residual tumor (R) classification was not reported. R0 resection rate in all
      reported patients is 30.5% (29/95). R1 resection rate is 3.2% (3/95). CONCLUSION:
      HIFU is found to be safe and feasible in locally advanced and metastatic
      pancreatic cancer with proven downstaging and downsizing effects. Further
      research on role of HIFU ablation as a neoadjuvant treatment for borderline
      resectable pancreatic cancer is needed.

TI  - Killing us softly with their wrongs: Nursing academia's 'killer elite' continue
      unabated.
LID - 10.1111/jonm.13391 [doi]
AB  - In our combined 90+ years in nursing we have published over 700 papers. Nothing, 
      however, evoked responses like "Academic nursing's killer elite'' (Thompson &
      Darbyshire, 2013). To say that we 'touched a nerve' is an understatement, but we 
      understated the malignant narcissist, corporate psychopath, dimensions of the
      'killer elite' and extend that discussion now. We received then and continue to
      receive, harrowing 'testimonies' (Hartin et al., 2020) from nurses describing,
      not linguistically sanitised 'incivility', but sustained bullying, gaslighting
      and corrosive narcissism by some senior academics who made their lives
      intolerable.

TI  - A qualitative analysis of vaccine decision makers' conceptualization and
      fostering of 'community engagement' in India.
PG  - 185
LID - 10.1186/s12939-020-01290-5 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Globally, and in India, research has highlighted the importance of
      community engagement in achieving national vaccination goals and in promoting
      health equity. However, community engagement is not well-defined and remains an
      underutilized approach. There is also paucity of literature on community
      engagement's effectiveness in achieving vaccination outcomes. To address that
      gap, this study interviewed Indian vaccination decision makers to derive a shared
      understanding of the evolving conceptualization of community engagement, and how 
      it has been fostered during India's Decade of Vaccines (2010-2020). METHODS:
      Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 25 purposefully sampled
      national-level vaccine decision makers in India, including policymakers,
      immunization program heads, and vaccine technical committee leads. Participants
      were identified by their 'elite' status among decisionmakers in the Indian
      vaccination space. Schutz' Social Phenomenological Theory guided development of
      an a priori framework derived from the Social Ecological Model. The framework
      helped organize participants' conceptualizations of communities, community
      engagement, and related themes. Inter-rater reliability was computed for a
      subsample of coded interviews, and findings were validated in a one-day member
      check-in meeting with study participants and teams. RESULTS: The interviews
      successfully elucidated participants' understanding of key terminology
      ("community") and approaches to community engagement propagated by the vaccine
      decision makers. Participants conceptualized 'communities' as vaccine-eligible
      children, their parents, frontline healthcare workers, and vaccination
      influencers. Engagement with those communities was understood to mean vaccine
      outreach, capacity-building of healthcare workers, and information dissemination.
      However, participants indicated that there were neither explicit policy
      guidelines defining community engagement nor pertinent evaluation metrics,
      despite awareness that community engagement is complex and under-researched.
      Examples of different approaches to community engagement ranged from vaccine
      imposition to empowered community vaccination decision-making. Finally,
      participants proposed an operational definition of community engagement and
      discussed concerns related to implementing it. CONCLUSIONS: Although decision
      makers had different perceptions about what constitutes a community, and how
      community engagement should optimally function, the combined group articulated
      its importance to ensure vaccination equity and reiterated the need for concerted
      political will to build trust with communities. At the same time, work remains to
      be done both in terms of research on community engagement as well as development 
      of appropriate implementation and outcome metrics.

TI  - Totally extraperitoneal repair for the 'sportsman's groin' via 'the Manchester
      Groin Repair': a comparison of elite versus amateur athletes.
PG  - 4371-4379
LID - 10.1007/s00464-020-07930-9 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Surgery has a recognised role in the treatment of 'sportsman's
      groin'. This study hypothesises that elite athletes have a superior advantage in 
      both pre- and post-op rehabilitation and therefore will present and resume
      sporting activities quicker. METHODS: A retrospective analysis on a secure
      database of athletes presenting with groin pain that underwent surgery for
      'inguinal disruption'. All data were explored via appropriate descriptive
      statistics and comparisons made between elite and amateur athletes. RESULTS: All 
      patients were male (n = 144). The median age 33 years (range 14-72). The median
      return to sporting activity was 4.5 weeks (range 2.0-16.0) with one amateur
      athlete being unable to return to sporting activity. Using the mean of both
      sides, a comparison of VAS pain scores at pre-operative and 1 month
      post-operative time points showed a significant reduction (p < 0.001). Comparing 
      'elite' versus 'amateur' athletes, significant differences were seen in patient
      age (median 26 vs 40 years; p < 0.001), lead time to clinic presentation (median 
      62.0 vs 111.5 days; p = 0.004), and time to return to sporting activity (4 vs 5
      weeks; p = 0.019). Additional MRI findings within the groin girdle were found in 
      89 patients (66.4%) and 34 patients (23.6%) had an MRI finding within the
      adductor tendon. CONCLUSION: The Manchester Groin Rrepair is an effective
      surgical management for 'inguinal disruption'. Elite athletes present quicker and
      return to sport sooner. Given the prevalence of other findings, a
      multidisciplinary approach to the 'sportsman's groin' is required.

      humans-perspectives from hot dog eating competitions.
PG  - 20200096
LID - 10.1098/rsbl.2020.0096 [doi]
AB  - Gut capacity and plasticity have been examined across multiple species, but are
      not typically explored in the context of extreme human performance. Here, I
      estimate the theoretical maximal active consumption rate (ACR) in humans, using
      39 years of historical data from the annual Nathan's Famous Hot Dog Eating
      Contest. Through nonlinear modelling and generalized extreme value analysis, I
      show that humans are theoretically capable of achieving an ACR of approximately
      832 g min(-1) fresh matter over 10 min duration. Modelling individual
      performances across 5 years reveals that maximal ACR significantly increases over
      time in 'elite' competitive eaters, likely owing to training effects. Extreme
      digestive plasticity suggests that eating competition records are quite
      biologically impressive, especially in the context of carnivorous species and
      other human athletic competitions.

TI  - Molecular Markers Associated with Agro-Physiological Traits under Terminal
      Drought Conditions in Bread Wheat.
LID - E3156 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijms21093156 [doi]
AB  - Terminal drought stress poses a big challenge to sustain wheat grain production
      in rain-fed environments. This study aimed to utilize the genetically diverse
      pre-breeding lines for identification of genomic regions associated with
      agro-physiological traits at terminal stage drought stress in wheat. A total of
      339 pre-breeding lines panel derived from three-way crosses of 'exotics x elite x
      elite' lines were evaluated in field conditions at Obregon, Mexico for two years 
      under well irrigated as well as drought stress environments. Drought stress was
      imposed at flowering by skipping the irrigations at pre and post anthesis stage. 
      Results revealed that drought significantly reduced grain yield (Y), spike length
      (SL), number of grains spikes(-1) (NGS) and thousand kernel weight (TKW), while
      kernel abortion (KA) was increased. Population structure analysis in this panel
      uncovered three sub-populations. Genome wide linkage disequilibrium (LD) decay
      was observed at 2.5 centimorgan (cM). The haplotypes-based genome wide
      association study (GWAS) identified significant associations of Y, SL, and TKW on
      three chromosomes; 4A (HB10.7), 2D (HB6.10) and 3B (HB8.12), respectively.
      Likewise, associations on chromosomes 6B (HB17.1) and 3A (HB7.11) were found for 
      NGS while on chromosome 3A (HB7.12) for KA. The genomic analysis information
      generated in the study can be efficiently utilized to improve Y and/or related
      parameters under terminal stage drought stress through marker-assisted breeding.

TI  - Effects of Cycling on Subsequent Running Performance, Stride Length, and Muscle
      Oxygen Saturation in Triathletes.
LID - E115 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/sports7050115 [doi]
AB  - Running performance is a determinant factor for victory in Sprint and Olympic
      distance triathlon. Previous cycling may impair running performance in
      triathlons, so brick training becomes an important part of training. Wearable
      technology that is used by triathletes can offer several metrics for optimising
      training in real-time. The aim of this study was to analyse the effect of
      previous cycling on subsequent running performance in a field test, while using
      kinematics metrics and SmO2 provided by wearable devices that are potentially
      used by triathletes. Ten trained triathletes participated in a randomised
      crossover study, performing two trial sessions that were separated by seven days:
      the isolated run trial (IRT) and the bike-run trial (BRT). Running kinematics,
      physiological outcomes, and perceptual parameters were assessed before and after 
      each running test. The running distance was significantly lower in the BRT when
      compared to the IRT, with a decrease in stride length of 0.1 m (p = 0.00) and
      higher %SmO2 (p = 0.00) in spite of the maximal intensity of exercise. No effects
      were reported in vertical oscillation, ground contact time, running cadence, and 
      average heart rate. These findings may only be relevant to 'moderate level'
      triathletes, but not to 'elite' ones. Triathletes might monitor their %SmO2 and
      stride length during brick training and then compare it with isolated running to 
      evaluate performance changes. Using wearable technology (near-infrared
      spectroscopy, accelerometry) for specific brick training may be a good option for
      triathletes.

TI  - Recommendations for Measurement and Management of an Elite Athlete.
LID - E105 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/sports7050105 [doi]
AB  - Athletes who merit the title 'elite' are rare and differ both quantitatively and 
      qualitatively from athletes of lower qualifications. Serving and studying elite
      athletes may demand non-traditional approaches. Research involving elite athletes
      suffers because of the typical nomothetic requirements for large sample sizes and
      other statistical assumptions that do not apply to this population. Ideographic
      research uses single-athlete study designs, trend analyses, and statistical
      process control. Single-athlete designs seek to measure differences in repeated
      measurements under prescribed conditions, and trend analyses may permit
      systematic monitoring and prediction of future outcomes. Statistical process
      control uses control charting and other methods from management systems to assess
      and modify training processes in near real-time. These methods bring assessment
      and process control into the real world of elite athletics.

TI  - Root renovation: how an improved understanding of basic root biology could inform
      the development of elite crops that foster sustainable soil health.
PG  - 597-612
LID - 10.1071/FP18200 [doi]
AB  - A major goal in agricultural research is to develop 'elite' crops with stronger, 
      resilient root systems. Within this context, breeding practices have focussed on 
      developing plant varieties that are, primarily, able to withstand pathogen attack
      and, secondarily, able to maximise plant productivity. Although great strides
      towards breeding disease-tolerant or -resistant root stocks have been made, this 
      has come at a cost. Emerging studies in certain crop species suggest that
      domestication of crops, together with soil management practices aimed at
      improving plant yield, may hinder beneficial soil microbial association or reduce
      microbial diversity in soil. To achieve more sustainable management of
      agricultural lands, we must not only shift our soil management practices but also
      our breeding strategy to include contributions from beneficial microbes. For this
      latter point, we need to advance our understanding of how plants communicate
      with, and are able to differentiate between, microbes of different lifestyles.
      Here, we present a review of the key findings on belowground plant-microbial
      interactions that have been made over the past decade, with a specific focus on
      how plants and microbes communicate. We also discuss the currently unresolved
      questions in this area, and propose plausible ways to use currently available
      research and integrate fast-emerging '-omics' technologies to tackle these
      questions. Combining past and developing research will enable the development of 
      new crop varieties that will have new, value-added phenotypes belowground.

TI  - The contribution of myostatin (MSTN) and additional modifying genetic loci to
      race distance aptitude in Thoroughbred horses racing in different geographic
      regions.
PG  - 625-633
LID - 10.1111/evj.13058 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Race distance aptitude in Thoroughbred horses is highly heritable and
      is influenced largely by variation at the myostatin gene (MSTN). OBJECTIVES: In
      addition to MSTN, we hypothesised that other modifying loci contribute to best
      race distance. STUDY DESIGN: Using 3006 Thoroughbreds, including 835 'elite'
      horses, which were >3 years old, had race records and were sampled from
      Europe/Middle-East, Australia/New Zealand, North America and South Africa, we
      performed genome-wide association (GWA) tests and separately developed a genomic 
      prediction algorithm to comprehensively catalogue additive genetic variation
      contributing to best race distance. METHODS: 48,896 single-nucleotide
      polymorphism (SNP) genotypes were generated from high-density SNP genotyping
      arrays. Heritability estimates, tests of GWA and genomic prediction models were
      derived for the phenotypes: average race distance, best race distance for elite, 
      nonelite and all winning horses. RESULTS: Heritability estimates were high ( h m 
      2 = 0.51, best race distance - elite; h m 2 = 0.42, best race distance -
      nonelite; h m 2 = 0.40, best race distance - all) and most of the variation was
      attributed to the MSTN gene. MSTN locus SNPs were the most strongly associated
      with the trait and included BIEC2-438999 (ECA18:66913090; P = 4.51 x 10(-110) ,
      average race distance; P = 2.33 x 10(-42) , best race distance - elite). The
      genomic prediction algorithm enabled the inclusion of variation from all SNPs in 
      a model that partitioned horses into short and long cohorts following assignment 
      of MSTN genotype. Additional genes with minor contributions to best race distance
      were identified. MAIN LIMITATIONS: The nongenetic influence of owner/trainer
      decisions on placement of horses in suitable races could not be controlled.
      CONCLUSIONS: MSTN is the single most important genetic contributor to best race
      distance in the Thoroughbred. Employment of genetic prediction models will lead
      to more accurate placing of horses in races that are best suited to their
      inherited genetic potential for distance aptitude.

TI  - Protective antibodies against Eastern equine encephalitis virus bind to epitopes 
      in domains A and B of the E2 glycoprotein.
PG  - 187-197
LID - 10.1038/s41564-018-0286-4 [doi]
AB  - Eastern equine encephalitis virus (EEEV) is a mosquito-transmitted alphavirus
      with a high case mortality rate in humans. EEEV is a biodefence concern because
      of its potential for aerosol spread and the lack of existing countermeasures.
      Here, we identify a panel of 18 neutralizing murine monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) 
      against the EEEV E2 glycoprotein, several of which have 'elite' activity with 50 
      and 99% effective inhibitory concentrations (EC50 and EC99) of less than 10 and
      100 ng ml(-1), respectively. Alanine-scanning mutagenesis and neutralization
      escape mapping analysis revealed epitopes for these mAbs in domains A or B of the
      E2 glycoprotein. A majority of the neutralizing mAbs blocked infection at a
      post-attachment stage, with several inhibiting viral membrane fusion.
      Administration of one dose of anti-EEEV mAb protected mice from lethal
      subcutaneous or aerosol challenge. These experiments define the mechanistic basis
      for neutralization by protective anti-EEEV mAbs and suggest a path forward for
      treatment and vaccine design.

TI  - Micronutrient productivity: a comprehensive parameter for biofortification in
      rice (Oryza sativa L.) grain.
PG  - 1311-1321
LID - 10.1002/jsfa.9306 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Enhancing the micronutrient content of staple crops such as rice will
      improve human nutrition and address the problem of hidden hunger globally. Rice
      grains consumed after polishing lack adequate amounts of micronutrients. The
      present study aims to reveal the effects of polishing on micronutrient content
      and to identify superior genotype(s) to improve yield and micronutrient content
      after polishing. RESULTS: AM65 exhibited the highest zinc content, and AM180 had 
      the highest iron content, even after polishing. There was little or no difference
      between the genotypes for zinc content in bran, indicating a possible threshold
      for micronutrient accumulation in the aleurone layer. A comprehensive selection
      criterion called 'micronutrient productivity' was used to select for both yield
      and micronutrient parameters. AM65 and ARB6 showed high zinc and iron
      productivity indices. OsZIP4b and OsZIP6c markers showed an association with iron
      content on an agarose gel. Sequencing of markers revealed that OsYSL15 and
      OsZIP6c were associated with grain zinc content and OsZIP3b, OsMTP1a, and OsYSL4b
      with grain iron content. These markers can be used for selecting superior
      accessions. CONCLUSION: AM65 was loaded with micronutrients and manifested a
      positive correlation with the grain yield, and it is undoubtedly 'super elite'.
      Bran does not drain the grain but rather acts as gateway for micronutrient
      transportation to the endosperm. Micronutrient productivity is a comprehensive
      parameter for the biofortification of grain. (c) 2018 Society of Chemical

      fixation activity.
PG  - 3523-3530
LID - 10.1093/jxb/ery115 [doi]
AB  - Symbiotic N2 fixation research thus far has been primarily focused on selection
      of bacteria. However, little progress in impacting crop yields has resulted from 
      this approach. Bacteria introduced in field soils rarely compete well with
      indigenous bacteria, including mutated lines selected for high nitrogen fixation 
      capacity. Consequently, introduction of 'elite' bacteria in fields commonly does 
      not result in crop yield increase. This review highlights that the primary
      regulation of N2 fixation is a result of response of integrated physiological
      activity at the plant level. Nitrogen feedback from the host plant plays an
      important role in regulating the N2 fixation rate. Rapid sequestration of fixed
      nitrogen by the plant is especially important for high N2 fixation activity. In
      addition, water cycling in the plant between the shoot and nodules plays a key
      role in sustaining high N2 fixation activity. Therefore, attention in selecting
      the host-plant genotype is suggested to be the next step to increasing N2
      fixation activity of grain legumes.

TI  - Is it a match? a novel method of evaluating medical school success.
PG  - 1432231
LID - 10.1080/10872981.2018.1432231 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Medical education program evaluation allows for curricular
      improvements to both Undergraduate (UME) and Graduate Medical Education (GME).
      UME programs are left with little more than match rates and self-report to
      evaluate success of graduates in The Match. OBJECTIVE: This manuscript shares a
      novel method of program evaluation through a systematic assessment of Match
      outcomes. DESIGN: Surveys were developed and distributed to Program Training
      Directors (PTDs) at our institution to classify residency programs into which our
      UME graduates matched using an ordinal response scale and open-ended responses.
      Outcomes-based measures for UME graduates were collected and analyzed. The
      relationship between PTD survey data and UME graduates' outcomes were explored.
      Open-ended response data were qualitatively analyzed using iterative cycles of
      coding and identifying themes. RESULTS: The PTD survey response rate was 100%.
      71% of our graduates matched to programs ranked as 'elite' (36%) or 'top' (35%)
      tier. The mean total number of 'Honors' grades achieved by UME graduates was 2.6.
      Data showed that graduates entering elite and top GME programs did not
      consistently earn Honors in their associated clerkships. A positive correlation
      was identified between USMLE Step 1 score, number of honors, and residency
      program rankings for a majority of the programs. Qualitative analysis identified 
      research, faculty, and clinical exposure as necessary characteristics of 'elite' 
      programs:. Factors considered by PTDs in the rating of programs included
      reputation, faculty, research, national presence and quality of graduates.
      CONCLUSIONS: This study describes a novel outcomes-based method of evaluating the
      success of UME programs. Results provided useful feedback about the quality of
      our UME program and its ability to produce graduates who match in highly-regarded
      GME programs. The findings from this study can benefit Clerkship Directors,
      Student Affairs and Curriculam Deans, and residency PTDs as they help students
      determine their competitiveness forspecialties and specific residency programs.

AB  - The two reclassifications of cannabis in England & Wales in 2004 and 2009 have
      been subjected to a series of academic analyses which have largely been centred
      on either the relationship to evidence, or in terms of the implications and
      realities of policing and health under the changes. However, despite the wealth
      of attention on this area, there have been relatively few attempts to understand 
      these policy movements through broader criminological theoretical frameworks. One
      recent exception is Shiner's (2015) utilisation of Garland's (2001) concept of
      'structured ambivalence'. This paper seeks to test this application through
      drawing upon an alternative source of evidence, namely, a series of 'elite'
      qualitative interviews, and using Kingdon's (1995) Multiple Streams model to make
      sense of the policy processes. In doing so, it largely corroborates Shiner's
      conclusions whilst also further illuminating particular agentic aspects and their
      intertwining with other structural and cultural forces which led to the
      reclassifications. These findings demonstrate the value of triangulating
      evidential sources and advances knowledge about the role of individuals in
      pursuing policy agendas within a broader shifting political climate. This
      provides greater scope to further test and understand how structured ambivalence 
      manifests itself in other cultural contexts and policy domains.

TI  - GeneHancer: genome-wide integration of enhancers and target genes in GeneCards.
LID - 10.1093/database/bax028 [doi]
AB  - A major challenge in understanding gene regulation is the unequivocal
      identification of enhancer elements and uncovering their connections to genes. We
      present GeneHancer, a novel database of human enhancers and their inferred target
      genes, in the framework of GeneCards. First, we integrated a total of 434 000
      reported enhancers from four different genome-wide databases: the Encyclopedia of
      DNA Elements (ENCODE), the Ensembl regulatory build, the functional annotation of
      the mammalian genome (FANTOM) project and the VISTA Enhancer Browser. Employing
      an integration algorithm that aims to remove redundancy, GeneHancer portrays 285 
      000 integrated candidate enhancers (covering 12.4% of the genome), 94 000 of
      which are derived from more than one source, and each assigned an
      annotation-derived confidence score. GeneHancer subsequently links enhancers to
      genes, using: tissue co-expression correlation between genes and enhancer RNAs,
      as well as enhancer-targeted transcription factor genes; expression quantitative 
      trait loci for variants within enhancers; and capture Hi-C, a promoter-specific
      genome conformation assay. The individual scores based on each of these four
      methods, along with gene-enhancer genomic distances, form the basis for
      GeneHancer's combinatorial likelihood-based scores for enhancer-gene pairing.
      Finally, we define 'elite' enhancer-gene relations reflecting both a
      high-likelihood enhancer definition and a strong enhancer-gene association.
      GeneHancer predictions are fully integrated in the widely used GeneCards Suite,
      whereby candidate enhancers and their annotations are displayed on every relevant
      GeneCard. This assists in the mapping of non-coding variants to enhancers, and
      via the linked genes, forms a basis for variant-phenotype interpretation of
      whole-genome sequences in health and disease. Database URL:

AB  - BACKGROUND: The impact of high exercise loads on a previously healthy heart
      remains controversial. We examined the consequences of decades of strenuous
      endurance exercise at the highest competition level on heart dimensions and
      volumes as well as on serum biomarkers of cardiac fibrosis/remodeling. METHODS
      AND RESULTS: We compared echocardiographic measurements and serum biomarkers of
      cardiac fibrosis/remodeling [troponin I, galectin-3, matrix metallopeptidase-2
      and -9, N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide, carboxy-terminal propeptide of 
      type I procollagen, and soluble suppressor of tumorigenicity-2
      (sST-2)/interleukin(IL)-1R4] in 53 male athletes [11 former professional
      ('elite') and 42 amateur-level ('sub-elite') cyclists or runners, aged
      40-70years] and 18 aged-matched controls. A subset of 15 subjects (5 controls, 3 
      sub-elite and 7 elite athletes) also underwent cardiac magnetic resonance imaging
      (cMRI). Elite and sub-elite athletes had greater echocardiography-determined left
      ventricular myocardial mass indexed to body surface area than controls (113+/-22,
      115.2+/-23.1 and 94.8+/-21g/m(2), respectively, p=0.008 for group effect), with
      similar results for left (50.5+/-4.4, 48.2+/-4.3 and 46.4+/-5.2mm, p=0.008) and
      right (38.6+/-3.8, 41.1+/-5.5 and 34.7+/-4.3mm, p<0.001) ventricular
      end-diastolic diameter, and cMRI-determined left atrial volume indexed to body
      surface area (62.7+/-8.1, 56.4+/-16.0 and 39.0+/-14.1ml/m(2), p=0.026). Two
      athletes showed a non-coronary pattern of small, fibrotic left ventricular
      patches detected by late gadolinium enhancement. No group effect was noted for
      biomarkers. CONCLUSIONS: Regardless of their competition level at a younger age, 
      veteran endurance athletes showed an overall healthy, non-pathological pattern of
      cardiac remodeling. Nonetheless, the physiopathology of the ventricular fibrotic 
      patches detected warrants further investigation.
