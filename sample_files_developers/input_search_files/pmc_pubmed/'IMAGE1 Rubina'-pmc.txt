TI  - Walnut (J. regia) Agro-Residues as a Rich Source of Phenolic Compounds.
LID - 535
AB  - Simple Summary: Agro-residues are usually discarded as landfill, or burnt or left
      to decompose in the orchard. The efficient use of these walnut agro-residues
      would be a strategy that simultaneously helps to preserve the environment and
      boosts the economic outcome for farmers and companies. While some studies have
      reported on the content of bioactive compounds in walnut husks, little or nothing
      is known to date about the bioactive compounds in the buds and bark. Potentially,
      if walnut parts are used as a valuable source of bioactive compound, they might
      still be reused for other purposes. The identification and quantification of new 
      phenolics between the different parts of the plant was carried out. It provided
      valuable data on their phenolic contents, and demonstrated where the extraction
      of individual phenolics would be meaningful. These data also show origin-related 
      phenolic contents across the cultivars, and thus these phenolic profiles might
      serve to define the origins of different walnut cultivars. The study will help to
      propose new directions for further studies essential for agro-food, cosmetics and
      pharmacy industries. Abstract: The present study was designed to identify and
      quantify the major phenolic compounds (phenolics) in the inner and outer husks,
      buds and bark of the Persian walnut, Juglans regia L. A comparison across six
      different cultivars grown in Slovenia was also carried out: ‘Fernor’, ‘Fernette’,
      ‘Franquette’, ‘Sava’, ‘Krka’ and ‘Rubina’. A total of 83 compounds were
      identified, which included 25 naphthoquinones, 15 hydroxycinnamic acids, 8
      hydroxybenzoic acids, 13 flavanols, 2 flavones, 1 flavanone and 19 flavonols. For
      the first time, 38 phenolics in the husks, 57 phenolics in the buds and 29
      phenolics in the bark were presented in J. regia within this study.
      Naphthoquinones were the major phenolics determined, approximately 75% of all
      analysed phenolics in the inner husk, 85% in the outer husk, 50% in buds and 80% 
      in bark. The highest content of phenolics was found in the walnut buds, followed 
      by the bark, the inner husk and the outer husk. On the basis of these high
      phenolic contents, walnut husks, buds and bark represented valuable by-products
      of the walnut tree. These data also show origin-related phenolic contents across 
      the cultivars, and thus these phenolic profiles might serve to define the origins
      of different walnut cultivars.

TI  - Influence of Ripening Stage and Cultivar on Physicochemical Properties and
      Antioxidant Compositions of Aronia Grown in South Korea.
LID - 598
AB  - The present study investigated the fruits of aronia (Aronia melanocarpa) across
      different stages of maturity and analyzed their physicochemical properties,
      antioxidant compositions, and activities. The selected aronia cultivars
      (‘Viking’, ‘McKenzie’, and ‘Kingstar K1’ were categorized based on maturity into 
      the immature stage (red tip), intermediary stage (red), and mature stage (dark
      purple). The key sugar components of aronia fruits were fructose, glucose, and
      sorbitol, while the main organic acid was found to be malic acid. The antioxidant
      content and activity of all three aronia cultivars showed significantly higher
      values for the red tip stage than the red or dark purple stages. However, the
      total anthocyanin content of aronia was the highest at the dark purple stage in
      three cultivars. The main polyphenols in aronia fruits were found to be catechol 
      and chlorogenic acid, with a decreasing tendency as maturation progressed. As a
      result, the red tip stage of aronia fruits contains comparatively more abundant
      flavonoids, phenolic compounds and polyphenols than the dark purple stage, with
      higher antioxidant activity.

TI  - Spinal cord injury during the second trimester of pregnancy.
PG  - 17052-
AB  - Introduction:: Pregnancies in women with spinal cord injury (SCI) are at greater 
      risk of morbidity and mortality. Although pregnancy after SCI is well elaborated 
      in the literature, SCI occurring during pregnancy is rarely reported. Abrupt
      changes in the body physiology because of SCI and the resulting disability add a 
      risk to maternal and fetal well-being. Not only is the burden of care increased
      but there is also a higher risk of developing pressure ulcers, urinary tract
      infections, autonomic instability, intrauterine growth retardation and venous
      thromboembolism. Case Presentation:: We report a case of a 32-year-old lady who
      had a traumatic SCI at C6 level during the second trimester of her pregnancy. She
      was admitted to a tertiary care rehabilitation facility after 2 months of her
      injury. This case highlights the comprehensive approach toward her management,
      including rehabilitation, spinal intervention and obstetrical care. To the best
      of our knowledge, this is the first case report of its kind from the Middle East.
      Discussion:: Multi-system involvement due to SCI during pregnancy results in
      intense physiological changes that affect the treatment options for anesthesia,
      surgery, labor and comprehensive rehabilitation. This case report emphasizes the 
      need for well-equipped, specialized centers for similar patients in developing
      health systems and aims to increase the awareness for management of SCI during
      pregnancy using a comprehensive approach.

TI  - Fruits of Black Chokeberry Aronia melanocarpa in the Prevention of Chronic
      Diseases.
LID - 944
AB  - In recent years, growing attention has been focused on the utilization of natural
      sources of antioxidants in the prevention of chronic diseases. Black chokeberry
      (Aronia melanocarpa) represents a lesser known fruit species utilized mainly as
      juices, purees, jams, jellies and wine, as important food colorants or
      nutritional supplements. The fruit is valued as a great source of antioxidants,
      especially polyphenols, such as phenolic acids (neochlorogenic and chlorogenic
      acids) and flavonoids (anthocyanins, proanthocyanidins, flavanols and flavonols),
      particularly cyanidin-3-galactoside and cyanidin-3-arabinoside, as well as
      (−)-epicatechin units. The berries of A. melanocarpa, due to the presence and the
      high content of these bioactive components, exhibit a wide range of positive
      effects, such as strong antioxidant activity and potential medicinal and
      therapeutic benefits (gastroprotective, hepatoprotective, antiproliferative or
      anti-inflammatory activities). They could be also contributory toward the
      prevention of chronic diseases including metabolic disorders, diabetes and
      cardiovascular diseases, because of supportive impacts on lipid profiles, fasting
      plasma glucose and blood pressure levels.
