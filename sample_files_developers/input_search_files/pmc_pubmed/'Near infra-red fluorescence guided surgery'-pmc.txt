TI  - Augmented and virtual reality in surgery—the digital surgical environment:
      applications, limitations and legal pitfalls.
LID - 454
AB  - The continuing enhancement of the surgical environment in the digital age has led
      to a number of innovations being highlighted as potential disruptive technologies
      in the surgical workplace. Augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) are
      rapidly becoming increasingly available, accessible and importantly affordable,
      hence their application into healthcare to enhance the medical use of data is
      certain. Whether it relates to anatomy, intraoperative surgery, or post-operative
      rehabilitation, applications are already being investigated for their role in the
      surgeons armamentarium. Here we provide an introduction to the technology and the
      potential areas of development in the surgical arena.
