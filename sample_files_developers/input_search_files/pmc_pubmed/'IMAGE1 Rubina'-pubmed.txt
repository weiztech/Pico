TI  - Walnut (J. regia) Agro-Residues as a Rich Source of Phenolic Compounds.
LID - 535 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/biology10060535 [doi]
AB  - The present study was designed to identify and quantify the major phenolic
      compounds (phenolics) in the inner and outer husks, buds and bark of the Persian 
      walnut, Juglans regia L. A comparison across six different cultivars grown in
      Slovenia was also carried out: 'Fernor', 'Fernette', 'Franquette', 'Sava', 'Krka'
      and 'Rubina'. A total of 83 compounds were identified, which included 25
      naphthoquinones, 15 hydroxycinnamic acids, 8 hydroxybenzoic acids, 13 flavanols, 
      2 flavones, 1 flavanone and 19 flavonols. For the first time, 38 phenolics in the
      husks, 57 phenolics in the buds and 29 phenolics in the bark were presented in J.
      regia within this study. Naphthoquinones were the major phenolics determined,
      approximately 75% of all analysed phenolics in the inner husk, 85% in the outer
      husk, 50% in buds and 80% in bark. The highest content of phenolics was found in 
      the walnut buds, followed by the bark, the inner husk and the outer husk. On the 
      basis of these high phenolic contents, walnut husks, buds and bark represented
      valuable by-products of the walnut tree. These data also show origin-related
      phenolic contents across the cultivars, and thus these phenolic profiles might
      serve to define the origins of different walnut cultivars.

AB  - This study was designed to identify and quantify the major phenolic constituents 
      in peeled kernel and pellicle of the walnut Juglans regia L. Data were compared
      across six different cultivars: 'Fernor', 'Fernette', 'Franquette', 'Sava',
      'Krka' and 'Rubina'. High-performance liquid chromatography coupled with mass
      spectrometry was used to identify and quantify these compounds. Nineteen
      ellagitanins, 12 ellagic acid derivatives, 4 anthocyanins and 5 other phenols
      were identified in the pellicle of these walnuts, and 15 dicarboxylic acid
      derivatives and 1 phenol in the peeled walnut kernels. Thirteen previously
      unreported compounds were identified in the peeled walnut kernels, and 14 in the 
      walnut pellicle. Hydrolysable tannins were the main phenolic compounds identified
      in the walnut kernels, and accounted for 31.0% to 35.1% of the total phenolics
      analysed. The highest intake of total phenolics content per walnut kernel can be 
      obtained by consumption of 'Franquette' and 'Rubina', with the lowest for 'Krka'.
