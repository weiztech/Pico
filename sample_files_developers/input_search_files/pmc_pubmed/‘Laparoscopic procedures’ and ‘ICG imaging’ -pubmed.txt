TI  - The mandate and work of ICRP Committee 3 on radiological protection in medicine.

AB  - The mandate of Committee 3 of the International Commission on Radiological
      Protection (ICRP) is concerned with the protection of persons and unborn children
      when ionising radiation is used in medical diagnosis, therapy, and biomedical
      research. Protection in veterinary medicine has been newly added to the mandate. 
      Committee 3 develops recommendations and guidance in these areas. The most recent
      documents published by ICRP that relate to radiological protection in medicine
      are 'Radiological protection in cone beam computed tomography' (ICRP Publication 
      129) and 'Radiological protection in ion beam radiotherapy' (ICRP Publication
      127). A report in cooperation with ICRP Committee 2 entitled 'Radiation dose to
      patients from radiopharmaceuticals: a compendium of current information related
      to frequently used substances' (ICRP Publication 128) has also been published.
      'Diagnostic reference levels in medical imaging' (ICRP Publication 135),
      published in 2017, provides specific advice on the setting and use of diagnostic 
      reference levels for diagnostic and interventional radiology, digital imaging,
      computed tomography, nuclear medicine, paediatrics, and multi-modality
      procedures. 'Occupational radiological protection in interventional procedures'
      was published in March 2018 as ICRP Publication 139. A document on radiological
      protection in therapy with radiopharmaceuticals is likely to be published in
      2018. Work is in progress on several other topics, including appropriate use of
      effective dose in collaboration with the other ICRP committees, guidance for
      occupational radiological protection in brachytherapy, justification in medical
      imaging, and radiation doses to patients from radiopharmaceuticals (an update to 
      ICRP Publication 128). Committee 3 is also considering the development of
      guidance on radiological protection in medicine related to individual
      radiosusceptibility, in collaboration with ICRP Committee 1.
