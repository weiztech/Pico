AB  - Background: Sentinel node biopsy using radioisotope and blue dye remains a gold
      standard for axillary staging in breast cancer patients with low axillary burden.
      However, limitations in the use of radioisotopes have resulted in emergence of
      novel techniques. This is the first in vivo study to assess the feasibility of
      combining the two most common novel techniques of using a magnetic tracer and
      indocyanine green (ICG) fluorescence. Materials and methods: A total of 48 mice
      were divided into eight groups. Groups 1 and 2, the co-localization groups,
      received an injection of magnetic tracers (Resovist((R)) and Sienna+((R)),
      respectively) and ICG fluorescence; distilled water was used as the solvent of
      ICG. Groups 3 and 4, the diluted injection groups, received an injection of
      magnetic tracers (Resovist and Sienna+, respectively) and saline for dilution.
      Groups 5, 6, and 7, the control groups, received magnetic tracer (Resovist,
      Sienna+) and ICG alone, respectively. Fluorescent intensity assessment and iron
      quantification of excised popliteal lymph nodes were performed. Group 1', a
      co-localization group, received an injection of magnetic tracers (Resovist) and
      ICG' fluorescence: saline was used as the solvent for ICG. Results: Lymphatic
      uptake of all tracers was confined to the popliteal nodes only, with
      co-localization confirmed in all cases and no significant difference in
      fluorescent intensity or iron content of ex vivo nodes between the groups (except
      for Group 1'). There was no impact of dilution on the iron content in the diluted
      Sienna+ group, but it significantly enhanced Resovist uptake (P=0.005). In
      addition, there was a significant difference in iron content (P=0.003) in Group
      1'. Conclusion: The combination of a magnetic tracer (Resovist or Sienna+) and
      ICG fluorescence is feasible for sentinel node biopsy and will potentially allow 
      for precise transcutaneous node identification, in addition to accurate
      intraoperative assessment. This radioisotope-free "combined technique" warrants
      further assessment within a clinical trial.
