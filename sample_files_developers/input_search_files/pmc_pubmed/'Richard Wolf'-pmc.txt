TI  - On the Vernacular Language Games of an Antagonistic Online Subculture.
LID - 718368
AB  - In this paper we develop an empirical, big data approach to analyze how alt-right
      vernacular concepts (such as kek and beta) were used on the notorious anonymous
      and ephemeral imageboard 4chan/pol/and the fan wiki Encyclopedia Dramatica. While
      4chan/pol/is broadly regarded as an influential source of many of the web’s most 
      successful memes such as Pepe the Frog, Encyclopedia Dramatica functions as a
      kind of satirical Wikipedia for this meme subculture, written in high concept and
      highly offensive vernacular style. While the site’s affordances make them
      distinct, they are connected by a subcultural style and politics that has
      recently become increasingly connected with violent right-wing activism, forming 
      a loose subcultural language community. Contrary to “memetic” theories of
      cultural evolution in media studies, our analysis draws on theoretical frameworks
      from poststructuralist and pragmatist philosophies of language and deploys
      empirical techniques from corpus linguistics to consider the role of online
      platforms in shaping these vernacular modes of expression. This approach helps us
      to identify instances of vernacular innovation within these corpora from
      2012-2020—a period during which the white supremacist “alt-right” movement arose 
      online. Through these analyses we contribute both to ongoing interdisciplinary
      attempts to bridge the gap between cultural-theoretical and
      computational-linguistic approaches to studying online subcultures, and to the
      empirical study of the vernacular roots of the “toxic memes” that appear to be an
      increasingly common feature on social media.

      pain.
LID - e66043
AB  - Perceived cues signaling others’ pain induce empathy which in turn motivates
      altruistic behavior toward those who appear suffering. This
      perception-emotion-behavior reactivity is the core of human altruism but does not
      always occur in real-life situations. Here, by integrating behavioral and
      multimodal neuroimaging measures, we investigate neural mechanisms underlying
      modulations of empathy and altruistic behavior by beliefs of others’ pain (BOP). 
      We show evidence that lack of BOP reduces subjective estimation of others’
      painful feelings and decreases monetary donations to those who show pain
      expressions. Moreover, lack of BOP attenuates neural responses to their pain
      expressions within 200 ms after face onset and modulates neural responses to
      others’ pain in the insular, post-central, and frontal cortices. Our findings
      suggest that BOP provide a cognitive basis of human empathy and altruism and
      unravel the intermediate neural mechanisms.

TI  - Open science, COVID-19, and the news: Exploring controversies in the circulation 
      of early SARS-CoV-2 genomic epidemiology research.
PG  - 1468-81
AB  - Some early English language news coverage of COVID-19 epidemiology focused on
      studies that examined how SARS-CoV-2 (the coronavirus that causes COVID-19) was
      evolving at the genetic level. The use of phylogenetic methods to analyse
      pathogen genetic sequence data to understand disease dynamics is called
      ‘molecular’ or ‘genomic’ epidemiology. Many research groups in this subfield
      utilise open science practices, which can involve the circulation of early
      unreviewed findings on publicly-accessible venues online. From March to May 2020,
      media outlets covered early SARS-CoV-2 genomic studies that claimed to have
      discovered types of SARS-CoV-2 that had mutated to be more transmissible. We use 
      methods from Science and Technology Studies (STS) to examine three cumulative
      cases in which unripe facts about SARS-CoV-2 genomics moved out of scientific
      publics and into mainstream news. The three cases are: (1) ‘A More “Aggressive”
      Strain of SARS-CoV-2?’, (2) ‘Eight SARS-CoV-2 Strains?’, and (3) ‘A “More
      Contagious,” “Mutant” Strain?’ In each case, findings were called into question
      and reporters’ framing was overly sensational. We interpret the COVID-19 pandemic
      as a ‘stress-test’ for open science practices, and argue that it is important for
      stakeholders to understand changes in scientific publication and dissemination
      processes in the wake of the pandemic.

TI  - New Images for Old Symbols: Meanings That Children Give to a Traditional Game.
LID - 676590
AB  - Traditional games are considered agents of enculturation. This article explores
      the procedure to access the cultural meanings transmitted in a traditional game. 
      The goal is to understand what children aged 6–11 make of the game called ‘the
      chained bear’ and to compare the meanings retrieved with those of different
      traditional versions of the game. For such a purpose, through an exploratory
      cross-sectional study, cartoons depicting people playing the game were exhibited 
      and viewers (n = 359; age range: 6–11; Mean age = 8.79; SD = 1.81) were asked to 
      interpret them as a drama play, as well as contributing a title, a plot and
      saying how they would name the characters. The results show that, beyond the
      individual images that each child created in their mind, most of them coincided
      in stories about harassment and defense and theft and protection. These plots
      match those of the ludic tradition, showing that the actions evoke different
      pictures to each individual, but share common cultural meanings in turn. The
      study shows a procedure to access the meanings that traditional games transmit
      and confirms that games contain pieces of culture, which makes them agents of
      enculturation.

TI  - Functional ecological convergence between the thylacine and small prey-focused
      canids.
LID - 58
AB  - Background: Morphological convergence is a fundamental aspect of evolution,
      allowing for inference of the biology and ecology of extinct species by
      comparison with the form and function of living species as analogues. The
      thylacine (Thylacinus cynocephalus), the iconic recently extinct marsupial, is
      considered a classic example of convergent evolution with the distantly related
      placental wolf or dog, though almost nothing is actually known regarding its
      ecology. This lack of data leads to questions regarding the degree of convergence
      with, and the similarity of, the functional ecology of the thylacine and the
      wolf/dog. Here, we examined the cranium of the thylacine using 3D geometric
      morphometrics and two quantitative tests of convergence to more precisely
      determine convergent analogues, within a phylogenetically informed dataset of 56 
      comparative species across 12 families of marsupial and placental faunivorous
      mammals. Using this dataset, we investigated patterns of correlation between
      cranial shape and diet, phylogeny, and relative prey size across these
      terrestrial faunivores. Results: We find a correlation between cranial, facial,
      and neurocranial shape and the ratio of prey-to-predator body mass, though
      neurocranial shape may not correlate with prey size within marsupials. The
      thylacine was found to group with predators that routinely take prey smaller than
      45% of their own body mass, not with predators that take subequal-sized or larger
      prey. Both convergence tests find significant levels of convergence between the
      thylacine and the African jackals and South American ‘foxes’, with lesser support
      for the coyote and red fox. We find little support for convergence between the
      thylacine and the wolf or dog. Conclusions: Our study finds little support for a 
      wolf/dog-like functional ecology in the thylacine, with it instead being most
      similar to mid-sized canids such as African jackals and South American ‘foxes’
      that mainly take prey less than half their size. This work suggests that concepts
      of convergence should extend beyond superficial similarity, and broader
      comparisons can lead to false interpretations of functional ecology. The
      thylacine was a predator of small to mid-sized prey, not a big-game specialist
      like the placental wolf. Supplementary Information: The online version contains
      supplementary material available at 10.1186/s12862-021-01788-8.

TI  - Detecting the effects of predator-induced stress on the global metabolism of an
      ungulate prey using fecal metabolomic fingerprinting.
LID - 6129
AB  - Few field tests have assessed the effects of predator-induced stress on prey
      fitness, particularly in large carnivore-ungulate systems. Because traditional
      measures of stress present limitations when applied to free-ranging animals, new 
      strategies and systemic methodologies are needed. Recent studies have shown that 
      stress and anxiety related behaviors can influence the metabolic activity of the 
      gut microbiome in mammal hosts, and these metabolic alterations may aid in
      identification of stress. In this study, we used NMR-based fecal metabolomic
      fingerprinting to compare the fecal metabolome, a functional readout of the gut
      microbiome, of cattle herds grazing in low vs. high wolf-impacted areas within
      three wolf pack territories. Additionally, we evaluated if other factors (e.g.,
      cattle nutritional state, climate, landscape) besides wolf presence were related 
      to the variation in cattle metabolism. By collecting longitudinal fecal samples
      from GPS-collared cattle, we found relevant metabolic differences between cattle 
      herds in areas where the probability of wolf pack interaction was higher.
      Moreover, cattle distance to GPS-collared wolves was the factor most correlated
      with this difference in cattle metabolism, potentially reflecting the variation
      in wolf predation risk. We further validated our results through a regression
      model that reconstructed cattle distances to GPS-collared wolves based on the
      metabolic difference between cattle herds. Although further research is needed to
      explore if similar patterns also hold at a finer scale, our results suggests that
      fecal metabolomic fingerprinting is a promising tool for assessing the
      physiological responses of prey to predation risk. This novel approach will help 
      improve our knowledge of the consequences of predators beyond the direct effect
      of predation.

LID - 1885193
AB  - Background: The use of remotely delivered early intervention after trauma may
      prevent and/or reduce symptoms of post-traumatic stress. Our research group
      evaluated a novel three-week therapist-guided internet-delivered intervention
      based on prolonged exposure (Condensed Internet-Delivered Prolonged Exposure;
      CIPE) in a pilot trial. The results indicated that the intervention was feasible,
      acceptable and reduced symptoms of post-traumatic stress at post-intervention
      compared to a waiting-list condition. Exposure to traumatic memories can be
      emotionally demanding and there is a need for detailed investigation of
      participants’ experiences in receiving this type of intervention
      remotely.Objective: Investigate participants’ experiences of receiving CIPE early
      after trauma.Method: In this study, qualitative thematic analysis was used and
      semi-structured interviews with 11 participants six months after intervention
      completion were conducted. All interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed
      verbatim.Results: One overarching theme labelled as ‘demanding and effective’ was
      identified. Participants expressed that treatment effects could only be achieved 
      by putting in a lot of effort and by being emotionally close to the trauma memory
      during exposure exercises. Participants reported CIPE to be a highly credible-
      and educative intervention that motivated them to fully engage in exposure
      exercises. The most distressing parts of the intervention was perceived as
      tolerable and important to do to heal psychologically after trauma. For many
      participants, the possibility to engage in the intervention whenever and where it
      suited them was helpful, although some participants described it as challenging
      to find a balance between their own responsibility and when to expect therapist
      support. The internet-based format was perceived as a safe forum for
      self-disclosure that helped some participants overcome avoidance due to shame
      during imaginal exposure.Conclusion: CIPE was considered demanding, yet effective
      by the interviewed participants. The most distressing parts of the intervention
      was perceived to be the most important and were tolerable and feasible to provide
      online.

TI  - A refined proposal for the origin of dogs: the case study of Gnirshöhle, a
      Magdalenian cave site.
LID - 5137
AB  - Dogs are known to be the oldest animals domesticated by humans. Although many
      studies have examined wolf domestication, the geographic and temporal origin of
      this process is still being debated. To address this issue, our study sheds new
      light on the early stages of wolf domestication during the Magdalenian period
      (16–14 ka cal BP) in the Hegau Jura region (Southwestern Germany and
      Switzerland). By combining morphology, genetics, and isotopes, our
      multidisciplinary approach helps to evaluate alternate processes driving the
      early phases of domestication. The isotope analysis uncovered a restricted, low
      δ15N protein diet for all analyzed Gnirshöhle specimens, while morphological
      examinations and phylogenetic relationships did not unequivocally assign them to 
      one or the other canid lineage. Intriguingly, the newly generated mitochondrial
      canid genomes span the entire genetic diversity of modern dogs and wolves. Such
      high mitochondrial diversity could imply that Magdalenian people tamed and reared
      animals originating from different wolf lineages. We discuss our results in light
      of three ecological hypotheses and conclude that both domestication and the
      existence of a specialized wolf ecomorph are highly probable. However, due to
      their proximity to humans and a restricted diet, we propose domestication as the 
      most likely scenario explaining the patterns observed herein.

TI  - Contracts Capsized by COVID-19: A Legal and Jewish Ethical Analysis.
PG  - 1-11
AB  - Countless contracts have been undermined by the COVID-19 pandemic of 2020 as well
      as government orders to contain it. Flights have been canceled, concerts have
      been called off, and dorms have been closed, just to name a few. Do these all
      count as breaches of contract—or are the parties excused due to the extraordinary
      circumstances? And how should the losses be allocated between the parties? The
      law provides one set of answers to these questions; ethics offers another. With a
      focus on American law (developed over the past two centuries) and Jewish ethics
      (developed over millennia), this paper shows that the two systems are in accord
      with some respects and differ in others: Both law and Jewish ethics would excuse 
      a party who cannot complete his contract due to a force beyond his control, like 
      the COVID-19 pandemic. Yet Jewish ethics would require that the excused party
      still be paid, while American law would not.

TI  - Symbolic action and constraint: the cultural logic of the 2017 UK General
      Election.
PG  - 1-43
AB  - This paper examines the influence of both the agential and structural aspects of 
      culture on the 2017 UK General Election. The empirical section of the paper is
      organised around three aspects of the Labour campaign narrative: its promise to
      provide a national ‘alternative’, its mobilisation of Corbyn as simultaneously an
      individual and an icon, and its use of rallies and social media as alternative
      stages from which to project its meanings. It identifies the material
      conditioning, coding and counter-coding, narrativisation and
      counter-narrativisation of key events, issues, and figures, demonstrating how the
      substantive contestation of the campaign occurred within a consensual formal
      grammar that constrained symbolic action and often produced consequences
      unintended by cultural workers themselves. It, therefore, demonstrates how
      culture retained a relative autonomy in influencing meaning outcomes in part due 
      to its formal semiotic logic. It introduces the notion of ‘code-rerouting’ to
      cultural sociology’s stock of conceptual tools and highlights how failure to
      conform to the structuring norms of civil rituals, such as presenting oneself to 
      public scrutiny during a campaign, or failure to project coherence between
      surface and depth, individual and icon, past and present, or between private and 
      public can prove fatal to performative felicity.

TI  - Reflexivity and humility evoke a transformable methodology in a post disaster
      context.
PG  - 1-24
AB  - Objective: The process of reflexivity is used to critically examine the
      experience of conducting qualitative research with functionally diverse older
      adults in a post disaster context. Methods: The design of the study began with an
      interpretative phenomenological framework, using in-depth interviews. Fifteen
      individuals with functional and access needs living in Puerto Rico were
      interviewed regarding their experiences after Hurricane María of 2017. Findings: 
      In the field, it was necessary to expand the initial design, and adjust to
      participants’ preferences and needs, as well as situational characteristics,
      without compromising ethical standards of practice. The methodology transformed
      because of the need for flexibility requiring humility from the researchers. A
      more relational form of inquiry was warranted, which acknowledged the
      intersubjectivity of human experience. This entailed adapting to community
      involvement, building rapport with community leaders functioning as gatekeepers, 
      and integrating family or friends in interviews. Discussion: The reflexive
      approach allowed for a better understanding of the researcher’s positionalities
      and how they influence the ability or inability to develop trust (e.g. insider/
      outsider status, Puerto Rican/ US, with functional and access needs/ without
      functional and access needs). Conclusions: Given the shift toward relational
      inquiry and due to the challenges faced while carrying out the study, we suggest 
      that post-disaster qualitative research would benefit from further including
      principles of indigenous decolonizing methodologies, which can be incorporated
      into studies using interpretative phenomenological analysis.

TI  - Genomes of Pleistocene Siberian Wolves Uncover Multiple Extinct Wolf Lineages.
PG  - 198-206.e8
AB  - Extant Canis lupus genetic diversity can be grouped into three phylogenetically
      distinct clades: Eurasian and American wolves and domestic dogs.1 Genetic studies
      have suggested these groups trace their origins to a wolf population that
      expanded during the last glacial maximum (LGM)1, 2, 3 and replaced local wolf
      populations.4 Moreover, ancient genomes from the Yana basin and the Taimyr
      peninsula provided evidence of at least one extinct wolf lineage that dwelled in 
      Siberia during the Pleistocene.35 Previous studies have suggested that
      Pleistocene Siberian canids can be classified into two groups based on cranial
      morphology. Wolves in the first group are most similar to present-day
      populations, although those in the second group possess intermediate features
      between dogs and wolves.67 However, whether this morphological classification
      represents distinct genetic groups remains unknown. To investigate this question 
      and the relationships between Pleistocene canids, present-day wolves, and dogs,
      we resequenced the genomes of four Pleistocene canids from Northeast Siberia
      dated between >50 and 14 ka old, including samples from the two morphological
      categories. We found these specimens cluster with the two previously sequenced
      Pleistocene wolves, which are genetically more similar to Eurasian wolves. Our
      results show that, though the four specimens represent extinct wolf lineages,
      they do not form a monophyletic group. Instead, each Pleistocene Siberian canid
      branched off the lineage that gave rise to present-day wolves and dogs. Finally, 
      our results suggest the two previously described morphological groups could
      represent independent lineages similarly related to present-day wolves and dogs.

TI  - Interpreting the socio-technical interactions within a wind damage–artificial
      neural network model for community resilience.
LID - 200922
AB  - The use of machine learning has grown in popularity in various disciplines.
      Despite the popularity, the apparent ‘black box’ nature of such tools continues
      to be an area of concern. In this article, we attempt to unravel the complexity
      of this black box by exploring the use of artificial neural networks (ANNs),
      coupled with graph theory, to model and interpret the spatial distribution of
      building damage from extreme wind events at a community level. Structural wind
      damage is a topic that is mostly well understood for how wind pressure translates
      to extreme loading on a structure, how debris can affect that loading and how
      specific social characteristics contribute to the overall population
      vulnerability. While these themes are widely accepted, they have proven difficult
      to model in a cohesive manner, which has led primarily to physical damage models 
      considering wind loading only as it relates to structural capacity. We take
      advantage of this modelling difficulty to reflect on two different ANN models for
      predicting the spatial distribution of structural damage due to wind loading.
      Through graph theory analysis, we study the internal patterns of the apparent
      black box of artificial intelligence of the models and show that social
      parameters are key to predict structural damage.

TI  - Targeting diamondback moths in greenhouses by attracting specific native
      parasitoids with herbivory-induced plant volatiles.
LID - 201592
AB  - We investigated the recruitment of specific parasitoids using a specific blend of
      synthetic herbivory-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs) as a novel method of pest
      control in greenhouses. In the Miyama rural area in Kyoto, Japan, diamondback
      moth (DBM) (Plutella xylostella, Lepidoptera: Plutellidae) larvae are an
      important pest of cruciferous crops in greenhouses, and Cotesia vestalis
      (Hymenoptera: Braconidae), a larval parasitoid of DBM, is found in the
      surrounding areas. Dispensers of HIPVs that attracted C. vestalis and honey
      feeders were set inside greenhouses (treated greenhouses). The monthly incidence 
      of DBMs in the treated greenhouses was significantly lower than that in the
      untreated greenhouses over a 2-year period. The monthly incidences of C. vestalis
      and DBMs were not significantly different in the untreated greenhouses, whereas
      monthly C. vestalis incidence was significantly higher than monthly DBM incidence
      in the treated greenhouses. Poisson regression analyses showed that, in both
      years, a significantly higher number of C. vestalis was recorded in the treated
      greenhouses than in the untreated greenhouses when the number of DBM adults
      increased. We concluded that DBMs were suppressed more effectively by C. vestalis
      in the treated greenhouses than in the untreated greenhouses.

TI  - Early box office prediction in China’s film market based on a stacking fusion
      model.
PG  - 1-18
AB  - Artificial intelligence has been increasingly employed to improve operations for 
      various firms and industries. In this study, we construct a box office revenue
      prediction system for a film at its early stage of production, which can help
      management overcome resource allocation challenges considering the significant
      investment and risk for the whole film production. In this research, we focus on 
      China’s film market, the second-largest box office in the world. Our model is
      based on data regarding the nature of a film itself without word-of-mouth data
      from social platforms. Combining extreme gradient boosting, random forest, light 
      gradient boosting machine, k-nearest neighbor algorithm, and stacking model
      fusion theory, we establish a stacking model for film box office prediction. Our 
      empirical results show that the model exhibits good prediction accuracy, with its
      1-Away accuracy being 86.46%. Moreover, our results show that star influence has 
      the strongest predictive power in this model.

TI  - The conservation value of admixed phenotypes in a critically endangered species
      complex.
LID - 15549
AB  - In today’s environmental crisis, conservationists are increasingly confronted
      with terminally endangered species whose last few surviving populations may be
      affected by allelic introgression from closely related species. Yet there is a
      worrying lack of evidence-based recommendations and solutions for this emerging
      problem. We analyzed genome-wide DNA markers and plumage variability in a
      critically endangered insular songbird, the Black-winged Myna (BWM, Acridotheres 
      melanopterus). This species is highly threatened by the illegal wildlife trade,
      with its wild population numbering in the low hundreds, and its continued
      survival urgently depending on ex-situ breeding. Its three subspecies occur along
      a geographic gradient of melanism and are variably interpreted as three species. 
      However, our integrative approach revealed that melanism poorly reflects the
      pattern of limited genomic differentiation across BWM subspecies. We also
      uncovered allelic introgression into the most melanistic subspecies, tertius,
      from the all-black congeneric Javan Myna (A. javanicus), which is native to the
      same islands. Based on our results, we recommend the establishment of three
      separate breeding programs to maintain subspecific traits that may confer local
      adaptation, but with the option of occasional cross-breeding between insurance
      populations in order to boost genetic diversity and increase overall viability
      prospects of each breeding program. Our results underscore the importance of
      evidence-based integrative approaches when determining appropriate conservation
      units. Given the rapid increase of terminally endangered organisms in need of
      ex-situ conservation, this study provides an important blueprint for similar
      programs dealing with phenotypically variable species.

TI  - The effects of personality and locus of control on trust in humans versus
      artificial intelligence.
LID - e04572
AB  - Introduction: We are increasingly exposed to applications that embed some sort of
      artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm, and there is a general belief that people
      trust any AI-based product or service without question. This study investigated
      the effect of personality characteristics (Big Five Inventory (BFI) traits and
      locus of control (LOC)) on trust behaviour, and the extent to which people trust 
      the advice from an AI-based algorithm, more than humans, in a decision-making
      card game. Method: One hundred and seventy-one adult volunteers decided whether
      the final covered card, in a five-card sequence over ten trials, had a
      higher/lower number than the second-to-last card. They either received no
      suggestion (control), recommendations from what they were told were previous
      participants (humans), or an AI-based algorithm (AI). Trust behaviour was
      measured as response time and concordance (number of participants' responses that
      were the same as the suggestion), and trust beliefs were measured as
      self-reported trust ratings. Results: It was found that LOC influences trust
      concordance and trust ratings, which are correlated. In particular, LOC
      negatively predicted beyond the BFI dimensions trust concordance. As LOC levels
      increased, people were less likely to follow suggestions from both humans or AI. 
      Neuroticism negatively predicted trust ratings. Openness predicted reaction time,
      but only for suggestions from previous participants. However, people chose the AI
      suggestions more than those from humans, and self-reported that they believed
      such recommendations more. Conclusions: The results indicate that LOC accounts
      for a significant variance for trust concordance and trust ratings, predicting
      beyond BFI traits, and affects the way people select whom they trust whether
      humans or AI. These findings also support the AI-based algorithm appreciation.

TI  - Democracy and the Politics of Coronavirus: Trust, Blame and Understanding.
LID - gsaa013
AB  - This article explores the relationship between crises and democracy through a
      focus on the unfolding coronavirus pandemic. Its central argument is that to
      interpret the current pandemic purely in terms of its epidemiology and public
      health implications risks overlooking its potentially more significant
      socio-political consequences. This is because the challenges posed by the
      coronavirus crisis have themselves become overlaid or layered-upon a pre-existing
      set of concerns regarding the performance, efficiency and capacity of democratic 
      political structures. The aim of this article is to try and understand and warn
      against what might be termed a rather odd form of cross-contamination whereby the
      cynicism, negativity and frustration concerning politicians, political processes 
      and political institutions that existed before the coronavirus outbreak is
      allowed to direct, define and automatically devalue how democratic structures are
      subsequently judged in terms of how they responded to the challenge. As such,
      this article focuses on the link between the Coronavirus crisis and the
      democratic crisis; or, more precisely, the risk that the Coronavirus crisis may
      mutate into and fuel a broader crisis of democracy.

TI  - When Lone Wolf Defectors Undermine the Power of the Opt-Out Default.
LID - 8973
AB  - High levels of cooperation are a central feature of human society, and
      conditional cooperation has been proposed as one proximal mechanism to support
      this. The counterforce of free-riding can, however, undermine cooperation and as 
      such a number of external mechanisms have been proposed to ameliorate the effects
      of free-riding. One such mechanism is setting cooperation as the default (i.e.,
      an opt-out default). We posit, however, that in dynamic settings where people can
      observe and condition their actions on others’ behaviour, ‘lone wolf’ defectors
      undermine initial cooperation encouraged by an opt-out default, while ‘good
      shepherds’ defeat the free-riding encouraged by an opt-in default. Thus, we
      examine the dynamic emergence of conditional cooperation under different default 
      settings. Specifically, we develop a game theoretical model to analyse
      cooperation under defaults for cooperation (opt-out) and defection (opt-in). The 
      model predicts that the ‘lone wolf’ effect is stronger than the ‘good shepherd’
      effect, which – if anticipated by players – should strategically deter
      free-riding under opt-out and cooperation under opt-in. Our experimental games
      confirm the existence of both ‘lone wolf’ defectors and ‘good shepherd’
      cooperators, and that the ‘lone wolf’effect is stronger in the context of organ
      donation registration behaviour. We thus show a potential ‘dark side’ to
      conditional cooperation (‘lone wolf effect’) and draw implications for the
      adoption of an opt-out organ donation policy.

TI  - Consultation, Consent, and the Silencing of Indigenous Communities.
PG  - 781-98
AB  - Over the past few decades, Indigenous communities have successfully campaigned
      for greater inclusion in decision‐making processes that directly affect their
      lands and livelihoods. As a result, two important participatory rights for
      Indigenous peoples have now been widely recognized: the right to consultation and
      the right to free, prior and informed consent (FPIC). Although these
      participatory rights are meant to empower the speech of these communities—to give
      them a proper say in the decisions that most affect them—we argue that the way
      these rights have been implemented and interpreted sometimes has the opposite
      effect, of denying them a say or ‘silencing’ them. In support of this conclusion 
      we draw on feminist speech act theory to identify practices of locutionary,
      illocutionary, and perlocutionary group silencing that arise in the context of
      consultation with Indigenous communities.

TI  - The morph as a minimal linguistic form.
PG  - 117-34
AB  - This paper makes a terminological proposal: that the old term morph can be used
      for a minimal linguistic form. Many linguists (not only morphologists) need such 
      a term, because we often refer to minimal linguistic forms, but the various terms
      used by linguists in roughly this meaning are either unclear or do not refer to
      forms. The term “morpheme” has three rather different meanings, and other terms
      such as “vocabulary item” are too abstract. The term “morph” can be used as the
      basis for defining other widely used terms such as “root”, “prefix”, and
      “suffix”, which are currently often defined as kinds of “morphemes”. It can also 
      serve as the basis for a clearer definition of suppletion (involving suppletive
      morph sets) and morph variants, thus avoiding the confusions surrounding the term
      “allomorph(y)”.

TI  - What makes a major change of wildlife management policy possible? Institutional
      analysis of Polish wolf governance.
LID - e0231601
AB  - Poland was one of the first countries of Central and Eastern Europe with stable
      wolf populations to effectively introduce year-round protection of the species.
      This paper traces the process of policy change using institutional theory as an
      organizational perspective. Based on the analysis of data from desk research and 
      semi-structured interviews, we propose a model of institutional change and argue 
      that in the 1990s, environmental activists and wildlife biologists successfully
      used a political window of opportunity connected with socio-economic
      transformation after 1989 and managed to induce the government to move the
      species from the domain of hunting to the domain of nature conservation. The new 
      policy, informed by an ecological paradigm, diverged from the historical path
      dominated by hunters and the vision of the wolf as a pest and a hunting target.
      The improved protection led to the numerical growth of Poland's wolves and
      ultimately to their westward expansion.

TI  - Putting deep learning in perspective for pest management scientists.
PG  - 2267-75
AB  - ‘Deep learning’ is causing rapid technological changes in many fields of science,
      and conjectures about its potential for transforming everyone's work and lives is
      a matter of great debate. Unfortunately, it is all too easy to apply it as a
      ‘black box’ tool with little consideration of its potential limitations,
      especially when the data it is being applied to is less than perfect. In this
      Perspective, I try to put deep learning into a broader mechanistic and historical
      context by showing how it relates to older forms of artificial intelligence; by
      providing a general explanation of how it operates; and by exploring some of the 
      challenges involved in its implementation. Examples wherein it has been applied
      to pest management problems are provided to illustrate how the technology works
      and the challenges deep learning faces. At least in the near term, its biggest
      impact on agrochemical development seems likely to come in automating the tedious
      work involved in assessing agrochemical efficacy, but getting there will require 
      major investments in building large, well‐curated data sets to work from and in
      providing the expertise required to assess the resulting model predictions in
      real‐world scenarios. Deep learning may also come to complement the machine
      learning methodologies already available for use in pesticide discovery and
      development, but it seems unlikely to supplant them. © 2020 The Authors. Pest

TI  - Humanity’s Best Friend: A Dog-Centric Approach to Addressing Global Challenges.
LID - 502
AB  - Simple Summary: The Earth is under increasing pressure from the burgeoning global
      human population and the subsequent rise in demand for food and a myriad of other
      finite resources. Mitigating the environmental, societal and ecological impact of
      the human footprint requires understanding the long-term relationships between
      our species and the plants and animals we now rely upon. In addition, the modern 
      scientific approach often conceives of, and addresses individual problems through
      narrow windows that can fail to take into account the connectedness of multiple
      problems. By broadening the scope of inquiry to include both science and
      humanities perspectives, and simultaneously focussing on a single species, we
      suggest that many of the United Nations Strategic Development Goals (SDGs) can be
      addressed more effectively. In this paper, we describe how a comprehensive
      assessment of the long-term relationship between humans and dogs can yield
      insights, and offer ways in which modern global challenges can be tackled.
      Abstract: No other animal has a closer mutualistic relationship with humans than 
      the dog (Canis familiaris). Domesticated from the Eurasian grey wolf (Canis
      lupus), dogs have evolved alongside humans over millennia in a relationship that 
      has transformed dogs and the environments in which humans and dogs have
      co-inhabited. The story of the dog is the story of recent humanity, in all its
      biological and cultural complexity. By exploring human-dog-environment
      interactions throughout time and space, it is possible not only to understand
      vital elements of global history, but also to critically assess our present-day
      relationship with the natural world, and to begin to mitigate future global
      challenges. In this paper, co-authored by researchers from across the natural and
      social sciences, arts and humanities, we argue that a dog-centric approach
      provides a new model for future academic enquiry and engagement with both the
      public and the global environmental agenda.

TI  - Mixed company: a framework for understanding the composition and organization of 
      mixed‐species animal groups.
PG  - 889-910
AB  - Mixed‐species animal groups (MSGs) are widely acknowledged to increase predator
      avoidance and foraging efficiency, among other benefits, and thereby increase
      participants' fitness. Diversity in MSG composition ranges from two to 70 species
      of very similar or completely different phenotypes. Yet consistency in
      organization is also observable in that one or a few species usually have
      disproportionate importance for MSG formation and/or maintenance. We propose a
      two‐dimensional framework for understanding this diversity and consistency,
      concentrating on the types of interactions possible between two individuals,
      usually of different species. One axis represents the similarity of benefit types
      traded between the individuals, while the second axis expresses asymmetry in the 
      relative amount of benefits/costs accrued. Considering benefit types, one extreme
      represents the case of single‐species groups wherein all individuals obtain the
      same supplementary, group‐size‐related benefits, and the other extreme comprises 
      associations of very different, but complementary species (e.g. one partner
      creates access to food while the other provides vigilance). The relevance of
      social information and the matching of activities (e.g. speed of movement) are
      highest for relationships on the supplementary side of this axis, but so is
      competition; relationships between species will occur at points along this
      gradient where the benefits outweigh the costs. Considering benefit amounts given
      or received, extreme asymmetry occurs when one species is exclusively a benefit
      provider and the other a benefit user. Within this parameter space, some MSG
      systems are constrained to one kind of interaction, such as shoals of fish of
      similar species or leader–follower interactions in fish and other taxa. Other
      MSGs, such as terrestrial bird flocks, can simultaneously include a variety of
      supplementary and complementary interactions. We review the benefits that species
      obtain across the diversity of MSG types, and argue that the degree and nature of
      asymmetry between benefit providers and users should be measured and not just
      assumed. We then discuss evolutionary shifts in MSG types, focusing on drivers
      towards similarity in group composition, and selection on benefit providers to
      enhance the benefits they can receive from other species. Finally, we conclude by
      considering how individual and collective behaviour in MSGs may influence both
      the structure and processes of communities.

TI  - Decision time modulates social foraging success in wild common ravens, Corvus
      corax.
PG  - 413-22
AB  - Social foraging provides several benefits for individuals but also bears the
      potential costs of higher competition. In some species, such competition arises
      through kleptoparasitism, that is when an animal takes food which was caught or
      collected by a member of its social group. Except in the context of caching, few 
      studies have investigated how individuals avoid kleptoparasitism, which could be 
      based on physical strength/dominance but also cognitive skills. Here, we
      investigated the foraging success of wild common ravens, Corvus corax,
      experiencing high levels of kleptoparasitism from conspecifics when snatching
      food from the daily feedings of captive wild boars in a game park in the Austrian
      Alps. Success in keeping the food depended mainly on the individuals’ age class
      and was positively correlated with the time to make a decision in whether to fly 
      off with food or consume it on site. While the effect of age class suggests that 
      dominant and/or experienced individuals are better in avoiding kleptoparasitism, 
      the effect of decision time indicates that individuals benefit from applying
      cognition to such decision‐making, independently of age class. We discuss our
      findings in the context of the ecological and social intelligence hypotheses
      referring to the development of cognitive abilities. We conclude that
      investigating which factors underline kleptoparasitism avoidance is a promising
      scenario to test specific predictions derived from these hypotheses.

TI  - The causality of borrowing: Lexical loans in Eurasian languages.
LID - e0223588
AB  - All languages borrow words from other languages. Some languages are more prone to
      borrowing, while others borrow less, and different domains of the vocabulary are 
      unequally susceptible to borrowing. Languages typically borrow words when a new
      concept is introduced, but languages may also borrow a new word for an already
      existing concept. Linguists describe two causalities for borrowing: need, i.e.,
      the internal pressure of borrowing a new term for a concept in the language, and 
      prestige, i.e., the external pressure of borrowing a term from a more prestigious
      language. We investigate lexical loans in a dataset of 104 concepts in 115
      Eurasian languages from 7 families occupying a coherent contact area of the
      Eurasian landmass, of which Indo-European languages from various periods
      constitute a majority. We use a cognacy-coded dataset, which identifies loan
      events including a source and a target language. To avoid loans for newly
      introduced concepts in languages, we use a list of lexical concepts that have
      been in use at least since the Chalcolithic (4000–3000 BCE). We observe that the 
      rates of borrowing are highly variable among concepts, lexical domains,
      languages, language families, and time periods. We compare our results to those
      of a global sample and observe that our rates are generally lower, but that the
      rates between the samples are significantly correlated. To test the causality of 
      borrowing, we use two different ranks. Firstly, to test need, we use a cultural
      ranking of concepts by their mobility (of nature items) or their labour intensity
      and “distance-from-hearth” (of culture items). Secondly, to test prestige, we use
      a power ranking of languages by their socio-cultural status. We conclude that the
      borrowability of concepts increases with increasing mobility (nature), and with
      increased labour intensity and “distance-from-hearth” (culture). We also conclude
      that language prestige is not correlated with borrowability in general (all
      languages borrow, independently of prestige), but prestige predicts the
      directionality of borrowing, from a more prestigious language to a less
      prestigious one. The process is not constant over time, with a larger inequality 
      during the ancient and modern periods, but this result may depend on the status
      of the data (non-prestigious languages often remain unattested). In conclusion,
      we observe that need and prestige compete as causes of lexical borrowing.

TI  - Compliance with water advisories after water outages in Norway.
LID - 1188
AB  - Background: Water advisories, especially those concerning boiling drinking water,
      are widely used to reduce risks of infection from contaminants in the water
      supply. Since the effectiveness of boil water advisories (BWAs) depends on public
      compliance, monitoring the public response to such advisories is essential for
      protecting human health. However, assessments of public compliance with BWAs
      remain sparse. Thus, this study was aimed at investigating awareness and
      compliance among residents who had received BWAs in Baerum municipality in
      Norway. Method: We conducted a cross-sectional study among 2764 residents who had
      received water advisories by SMS in the municipality of Baerum between January
      and September 2017. We analysed data from two focus group discussions and an
      online survey sent to all residents who had received an advisory. We conducted
      descriptive analyses and calculated odds ratios (OR) using logistic regression to
      identify associations of compliance and awareness with demographic
      characteristics. Results: Of the 611 respondents, 67% reported that they had
      received a water advisory notification. Effective compliance rate with safe
      drinking water practices, either by storing clean drinking water or boiling tap
      water, after a water outage was 72% among those who remembered receiving a
      notification. Compliance with safe drinking water advisories was lower among men 
      than women (OR 0.53, 95% CI 0.29–0.96), but was independent of age, education and
      household type. The main reason for respondents’ non-compliance with safe water
      practices was that they perceived the water to be safe to drink after letting it 
      flush through the tap until it became clear. Conclusions: Awareness of advisories
      was suboptimal among residents who had received notifications, but compliance was
      high. The present study highlights the need to improve the distribution, phrasing
      and content of water advisory notifications to achieve greater awareness and
      compliance. Future studies should include hard-to-reach groups with adequate data
      collection approaches and examine the use of BWAs in a national context to inform
      future policies on BWAs. Electronic supplementary material: The online version of

      irrelevant. Such variation in the accuracy of social information is predicted to 
      select for receivers to discriminate between sources of social information. In
      this study, we used playback experiments to determine whether Western Australian 
      magpies (Cracticus tibicen dorsalis) respond to the predator information
      associated with alarm calls. Magpies were exposed to the alarm calls of two group
      members that differed in the threat associated with the alarm call: one call was 
      played in the presence of a predator model while the other was not—in order to
      establish differences in the predator information provided by each caller. We
      then played back the alarm calls of the same group members in the absence of the 
      predator model to determine whether magpies responded differently to signallers
      in response to the previous association between the alarm call and a predator
      threat. We found that receivers showed significantly greater levels of
      responsiveness to signallers that previously gave alarm calls in the appropriate 
      context. Thus, the accuracy of threat-based information influenced subsequent
      receiver response.

TI  - CRISPR’d babies: human germline genome editing in the ‘He Jiankui affair’*.
PG  - 111-83
AB  - The world was shocked in Nov. 25, 2018 by the revelation that He Jiankui had used
      clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (‘CRISPR’) to edit
      embryos—two of which had, sometime in October, become living babies. This article
      is an effort to provide some deep context for the He Jiankui affair and to begin 
      analyzing it. It focuses on He's experiment, without delving into the broader
      ethical issues around ‘human germline genome editing’ in the abstract. It begins 
      by carefully defining ‘human germline genome editing’. It then describes the
      little we know about the experiment before providing background on CRISPR, the
      pre-He ethical and legal status of human germline genome editing, and on He
      himself. The fourth, and longest, section provides a detailed narrative of the
      revelation of the He experiment and its fallout. The fifth section critiques the 
      experiment, which I believe merits unequivocal condemnation on several grounds.
      The last section suggests some important immediate reactions, by ‘Science’ and by
      China.

TI  - Ancient RNA from Late Pleistocene permafrost and historical canids shows
      tissue-specific transcriptome survival.
LID - e3000166
AB  - While sequencing ancient DNA (aDNA) from archaeological material is now
      commonplace, very few attempts to sequence ancient transcriptomes have been made,
      even from typically stable deposition environments such as permafrost. This is
      presumably due to assumptions that RNA completely degrades relatively quickly,
      particularly when dealing with autolytic, nuclease-rich mammalian tissues.
      However, given the recent successes in sequencing ancient RNA (aRNA) from various
      sources including plants and animals, we suspect that these assumptions may be
      incorrect or exaggerated. To challenge the underlying dogma, we generated shotgun
      RNA data from sources that might normally be dismissed for such study. Here, we
      present aRNA data generated from two historical wolf skins, and
      permafrost-preserved liver tissue of a 14,300-year-old Pleistocene canid. Not
      only is the latter the oldest RNA ever to be sequenced, but it also shows
      evidence of biologically relevant tissue specificity and close similarity to
      equivalent data derived from modern-day control tissue. Other hallmarks of RNA
      sequencing (RNA-seq) data such as exon-exon junction presence and high endogenous
      ribosomal RNA (rRNA) content confirms our data’s authenticity. By performing
      independent technical library replicates using two high-throughput sequencing
      platforms, we show not only that aRNA can survive for extended periods in
      mammalian tissues but also that it has potential for tissue identification. aRNA 
      also has possible further potential, such as identifying in vivo genome activity 
      and adaptation, when sequenced using this technology.

TI  - Stress as Offense to Self: a Promising Approach Comes of Age.
PG  - 205-38
AB  - Stress is related to goals being thwarted. Arguably, protecting one’s self, both 
      in terms of personal self-esteem and in terms of social self-esteem, is among the
      most prominent goals people pursue. Although this line of thought is hardly
      disputed, it does not play the prominent role in occupational health psychology
      that we think it deserves. Stress-as-Offense-to-Self theory focuses on threats
      and boosts to the self as important aspects of stressful, and resourceful,
      experiences at work. Within this framework we have developed the new concepts of 
      illegitimate tasks and illegitimate stressors; we have investigated appreciation 
      as a construct in its own right, rather than as part of larger constructs such as
      social support; and we propose that the threshold for noticing implications for
      the self in one’s surroundings typically is low, implying that even subtle
      negative cues are likely to be appraised as offending, as exemplified by the
      concept of subtly offending feedback. Updating the first publication of the SOS
      concept, the current paper presents its theoretical rationale as well as research
      conducted so far. Research has covered a variety of phenomena, but the emphasis
      has been (a) on illegitimate tasks, which now can be considered as an established
      stressor, and (b) on appreciation, showing its importance in general and as a
      core element of social support. Furthermore, we discuss implications for further 
      research as well as practical implications of an approach that is organized
      around threats and boosts to the self, thus complementing approaches that are
      organized around specific conditions or behaviors.

TI  - The Multilevel Regulation of Complex Policy Problems: Uncertainty and the Swine
      Flu Pandemic.
PG  - 80-98
AB  - This article aims at understanding the challenges of tackling complex policy
      problems in multilevel governance. In order to better grasp the multilevel
      regulation of complex policy problems, it is needed to understand how uncertainty
      and scientific expertise are dealt with. We investigate this via the regulation
      of pandemics by the EU and the WHO, with the H1N1 pandemic of 2009 as critical
      case. The analysis of the multilevel practice reveals that the attitude toward
      uncertainty fundamentally differed between the global (WHO) and the European
      level. At the global level a classic speaking truth to power approach involved
      the denial of uncertainty, while at the EU level the assigned role of providing
      scientific expertise was interpreted as a necessity to openly communicate about
      uncertainty. While the global approach was heavily criticized, the uncertainty
      communication at the European level was much appreciated.

TI  - Null Hypothesis Testing ≠ Scientific Inference: A Critique of the Shaky Premise
      at the Heart of the Science and Values Debate, and a Defense of Value‐Neutral
      Risk Assessment.
PG  - 1520-32
AB  - Many philosophers and statisticians argue that risk assessors are morally
      obligated to evaluate the probabilities and consequences of methodological error,
      and to base their decisions of whether to adopt a given parameter value, model,
      or hypothesis on those considerations. This argument is couched within the rubric
      of null hypothesis testing, which I suggest is a poor descriptive and normative
      model for risk assessment. Risk regulation is not primarily concerned with
      evaluating the probability of data conditional upon the null hypothesis, but
      rather with measuring risks, estimating the consequences of available courses of 
      action and inaction, formally characterizing uncertainty, and deciding what to do
      based upon explicit values and decision criteria. In turn, I defend an ideal of
      value‐neutrality, whereby the core inferential tasks of risk assessment—such as
      weighing evidence, estimating parameters, and model selection—should be guided by
      the aim of correspondence to reality. This is not to say that value judgments be 
      damned, but rather that they should be accounted for within a structured approach
      to decision analysis, rather than embedded within risk assessment in an informal 
      manner.

TI  - Population genomics of grey wolves and wolf-like canids in North America.
LID - e1007745
AB  - North America is currently home to a number of grey wolf (Canis lupus) and
      wolf-like canid populations, including the coyote (Canis latrans) and the
      taxonomically controversial red, Eastern timber and Great Lakes wolves. We
      explored their population structure and regional gene flow using a dataset of 40 
      full genome sequences that represent the extant diversity of North American
      wolves and wolf-like canid populations. This included 15 new genomes (13 North
      American grey wolves, 1 red wolf and 1 Eastern timber/Great Lakes wolf), ranging 
      from 0.4 to 15x coverage. In addition to providing full genome support for the
      previously proposed coyote-wolf admixture origin for the taxonomically
      controversial red, Eastern timber and Great Lakes wolves, the discriminatory
      power offered by our dataset suggests all North American grey wolves, including
      the Mexican form, are monophyletic, and thus share a common ancestor to the
      exclusion of all other wolves. Furthermore, we identify three distinct
      populations in the high arctic, one being a previously unidentified “Polar wolf” 
      population endemic to Ellesmere Island and Greenland. Genetic diversity analyses 
      reveal particularly high inbreeding and low heterozygosity in these Polar wolves,
      consistent with long-term isolation from the other North American wolves.

TI  - Man Haron Monis and the Sydney Lindt Café Siege – Not a Terrorist Attack.
PG  - 839-901
AB  - On 15 December 2014, nearly 20 years after he arrived in Australia from Iran, Man
      Haron Monis took 18 people hostage in the Lindt Café in Sydney and announced that
      Australia was ‘under attack by the Islamic State’. After a 16-hour siege, during 
      which negotiators had no direct communication with him, Monis shot dead one of
      his hostages, precipitating the police ‘emergency action’ which broke the siege. 
      Although Monis had been a prolific user of the Internet and social media, the
      subsequent Coroner’s inquest found that Monis made little sophisticated
      preparation for the siege and did not announce his intention nor did he leave any
      clear terrorist-inspired message or martyrdom video. Other than demanding a
      debate with the Prime Minister on radio and have the Islamic State flag delivered
      to the café, Monis made no specific terrorist demands. At the time of the siege, 
      Monis was also on bail, charged with multiple sex offences against women, alleged
      to have been committed whilst he held himself out as a ‘spiritual healer’. Monis 
      was also charged with being an accessory to the murder of his former partner and 
      had recently failed to obtain custody of his two Australian born children. His
      professed status as a Shi’a Muslim cleric was fraudulent, and forensic
      examination of his use of the Internet and social media found no evidence that
      Monis ever had any contact with Islamic State or any other terrorist organisation
      and that on the day before the siege, he had only 12 followers on Twitter. The
      evidence does not support the conclusion that Monis suddenly ‘radicalised’ and
      committed an act of terrorism. Instead, the evidence shows that Monis was a
      malignant narcissist whose behaviour can better be formulated as lone-actor
      grievance-fuelled violence.

TI  - A Stakeholder Approach to Risk Management.
PG  - 53-75
AB  - In crisis management, risk management has been conceived mainly as a proactive
      pre-crisis management effort where it is deployed for crisis prevention and
      preparedness efforts. This chapter argues that risk management extends into the
      entire crisis management continuum, as crises ignite new types of risks with
      their associated stakeholders. Organizations should continually identify, manage 
      and communicate risks to key stakeholders during the different phases of crisis
      management. A stakeholder orientation demands that organizations seek and involve
      risk stakeholders in the risk management process. The level of involvement will
      depend on both the identified risks and how stakeholders are expected to be
      affected by the proposed solutions and decision-making processes.

TI  - “Good Guys Don’t Rape”: Greek and Non-Greek College Student Perpetrator Rape
      Myths.
LID - 60
AB  - The current study examined sexual assault perpetrator rape myths among college
      students, and in particular Greek students. Fraternity men are overrepresented
      among sexual assault perpetrators, while sorority women are at increased risk for
      victimization of sexual assault. The current study examined Greek-affiliated and 
      non-Greek-affiliated perceptions of perpetrator rape myths among 892 college
      students; 58% of the sample was Greek-affiliated. Men and Greek-affiliated
      students reported higher agreement on stereotypes than women and
      non-Greek-affiliated students regarding perpetrator rape myths. Specifically,
      fraternity men reported higher stereotypical perceptions compared to all women
      and non-affiliated men, while there was no difference between sorority and
      non-affiliated women.

AB  - Both multiculturalism and interculturalism strive for the creation of a
      well-ordered society in which the integration of all citizens is realized. This
      shared ambition, however, can only be realized if the quality of the social

      across ethnocultural and religious diversity shapes the stability, success and

TI  - Use of co-verbal gestures during word-finding difficulty among Cantonese speakers
      with fluent aphasia and unimpaired controls.
PG  - 216-33
AB  - Background: Co-verbal gestures refer to hand or arm movements made during
      speaking. Spoken language and gestures have been shown to be tightly integrated
      in human communication. Aims: The present study investigated whether co-verbal
      gesture use was associated with lexical retrieval in connected speech in
      unimpaired speakers and persons with aphasia (PWA). Methods & Procedures:
      Narrative samples of 58 fluent PWA and 58 control speakers were extracted from
      Cantonese AphasiaBank. Based on the indicators of word-finding difficulty (WFD)
      in connected speech adapted from previous research, and a gesture annotation
      system with independent coding of gesture forms and functions, all WFD instances 
      were identified. The presence and type of gestures accompanying each incident of 
      WFD were then annotated. Finally, whether the use of gesture was accompanied by
      resolution of WFD, i.e., the corresponding target word could be retrieved, was
      examined. Outcomes & Results: Employment of co-verbal gesture did not seem to be 
      related to the success of word retrieval. PWA’s naming ability at single-word
      level and their overall language ability (as reflected by the aphasia quotient of
      the Cantonese version of the Western Aphasia Battery) were found to be the two
      strongest predictors of success rate of resolving WFD. Conclusions: The Lexical
      Retrieval Hypothesis highlighting the facilitative functions of iconic and
      metaphoric gestures in lexical retrieval was not supported. Challenges in
      conducting research related to WFD, and the clinical implications in
      gesture-based language intervention for PWA were discussed.

TI  - Imitation of novel conspecific and human speech sounds in the killer whale
      (Orcinus orca).
LID - 20172171
AB  - Vocal imitation is a hallmark of human spoken language, which, along with other
      advanced cognitive skills, has fuelled the evolution of human culture.
      Comparative evidence has revealed that although the ability to copy sounds from
      conspecifics is mostly uniquely human among primates, a few distantly related
      taxa of birds and mammals have also independently evolved this capacity.
      Remarkably, field observations of killer whales have documented the existence of 
      group-differentiated vocal dialects that are often referred to as traditions or
      cultures and are hypothesized to be acquired non-genetically. Here we use a
      do-as-I-do paradigm to study the abilities of a killer whale to imitate novel
      sounds uttered by conspecific (vocal imitative learning) and human models (vocal 
      mimicry). We found that the subject made recognizable copies of all familiar and 
      novel conspecific and human sounds tested and did so relatively quickly (most
      during the first 10 trials and three in the first attempt). Our results lend
      support to the hypothesis that the vocal variants observed in natural populations
      of this species can be socially learned by imitation. The capacity for vocal
      imitation shown in this study may scaffold the natural vocal traditions of killer
      whales in the wild.

TI  - Postcranial diversity and recent ecomorphic impoverishment of North American gray
      wolves.
LID - 20170613
AB  - Recent advances in genomics and palaeontology have begun to unravel the complex
      evolutionary history of the gray wolf, Canis lupus. Still, much of their
      phenotypic variation across time and space remains to be documented. We examined 
      the limb morphology of the fossil and modern North American gray wolves from the 
      late Quaternary (<ca 70 ka) to better understand their postcranial diversity
      through time. We found that the late-Pleistocene gray wolves were characterized
      by short-leggedness on both sides of the Cordilleran–Laurentide ice sheets, and
      that this trait survived well into the Holocene despite the collapse of
      Pleistocene megafauna and disappearance of the ‘Beringian wolf' from Alaska. By
      contrast, extant populations in the Midwestern USA and northwestern North America
      are distinguished by their elongate limbs with long distal segments, which appear
      to have evolved during the Holocene possibly in response to a new level or type
      of prey depletion. One of the consequences of recent extirpation of the Plains
      (Canis lupus nubilus) and Mexican wolves (C. l. baileyi) from much of the USA is 
      an unprecedented loss of postcranial diversity through removal of short-legged
      forms. Conservation of these wolves is thus critical to restoration of the
      ecophenotypic diversity and evolutionary potential of gray wolves in North
      America.

TI  - Re-analysing tobacco industry funded research on the effect of plain packaging on
      minors in Australia: Same data but different results.
LID - 130
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Our objective was to re-analyse the data used in an industry-funded
      working paper to study the effect of plain packaging on youth smoking prevalence 
      in Australia, allowing for other tobacco control measures introduced over the
      period 2001-2013, and using a more appropriate method of analysis. METHODS:
      Monthly smoking prevalence and sample sizes from repeat cross-sectional surveys
      were reconstructed from the working paper by reverse engineering of the
      industry-presented data, and analysed as a time series using logistic regression.
      Power analysis presented in the industry-funded working paper was re-calculated. 
      RESULTS: Smoking prevalence among minors in Australia declined from 11.6% to 5.6%
      over the 13-year period examined; an overall 52% relative reduction or an average
      annual reduction of 5.5% (95% confidence interval 4.6% to 6.4%). There was a
      12.1% (-4.8% to 26.2%) relative reduction in smoking prevalence when plain
      packaging was introduced, though the reduction was not statistically significant.
      Re-calculated power values were much lower than those reported in the
      industry-funded paper, confirming the inconclusiveness of its findings, as
      pointed out in previous critiques. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest a decline of
      smoking prevalence in minors following the introduction of plain packaging in
      Australia. They differ substantially from those presented in an industry-funded
      study on the effects of plain packaging on smoking prevalence in minors in
      Australia, which used the same data.

LID - 1452
AB  - Light-sheet fluorescence microscopy (LSFM) enables high-speed, high-resolution,
      and gentle imaging of live specimens over extended periods. Here we describe a
      technique that improves the spatiotemporal resolution and collection efficiency
      of LSFM without modifying the underlying microscope. By imaging samples on
      reflective coverslips, we enable simultaneous collection of four complementary
      views in 250 ms, doubling speed and improving information content relative to
      symmetric dual-view LSFM. We also report a modified deconvolution algorithm that 
      removes associated epifluorescence contamination and fuses all views for
      resolution recovery. Furthermore, we enhance spatial resolution (to <300 nm in
      all three dimensions) by applying our method to single-view LSFM, permitting
      simultaneous acquisition of two high-resolution views otherwise difficult to
      obtain due to steric constraints at high numerical aperture. We demonstrate the
      broad applicability of our method in a variety of samples, studying
      mitochondrial, membrane, Golgi, and microtubule dynamics in cells and calcium
      activity in nematode embryos.

TI  - Intact animacy perception during chase detection in ASD.
LID - 11851
AB  - We explored the strength of implicit social inferences in adolescents with and
      without Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) using a chasing paradigm in which
      participants judged the absence/presence of a chase within a display of four
      seemingly randomly moving dots. While two of these dots always moved randomly,
      the two others could fulfill the role of being either the chasing (wolf) or
      chased (sheep) dot. In the chase-present (but not the chase-absent) trials the
      wolf displayed chasing behavior defined by the degree to which the dot reliably
      moved towards the sheep (chasing subtlety). Previous research indicated that
      chasing subtlety strongly influenced chase detection in typically developing (TD)
      adults. We intended to replicate and extend this finding to adolescents with and 
      without ASD, while also adding either a social or a non-social cue to the
      displays. Our results confirmed the importance of chasing subtlety and indicated 
      that adding social, but not non-social, information further improved chase
      detection performance. Interestingly, the performance of adolescents with ASD was
      less dependent on chasing subtlety than that of their TD counterparts.
      Nonetheless, adolescents with and without ASD did not differ in their use of the 
      added social (or non-social) cue.

TI  - Reputation management promotes strategic adjustment of service quality in cleaner
      wrasse.
LID - 8425
AB  - Adjusting one’s behaviour in response to eavesdropping bystanders is considered a
      sophisticated social strategy, yet the underlying mechanisms are not well
      studied. Cleaner wrasse, Labroides dimidiatus, cooperate by eating ectoparasites 
      off “client” fishes, or cheat (i.e. bite) and eat client mucus. Image scoring by 
      bystander clients generally causes cleaners from socially-complex (i.e. high
      cleaner and client abundance; high client species richness) habitats to increase 
      levels of cooperation. However, some individuals may periodically provide tactile
      stimulation to small resident clients, which attract bystanders close that are
      bitten, a form of tactical deception. Cortisol injection can reproduce this
      pattern. Here, we tested whether cleaners from socially-complex versus simple
      habitats respond differently to cortisol injections in terms of their cleaning
      interactions with clients. We found that only cleaners from the socially-complex 
      habitat respond to cortisol injection with strategies functioning as tactical
      deception: i.e. increased tactile stimulation to small clients and increased
      cheating of large clients relative to small ones. At the socially-simple site,
      where reputation management is less important, cortisol-treated fish increased
      their overall levels of cheating, especially of small clients. Thus, strategic
      adjustments to cooperative behaviour and tactical deception are likely
      context-dependent, forming part of general reputation management abilities in
      cleaner wrasse.

TI  - Ancient European dog genomes reveal continuity since the Early Neolithic.
LID - 16082
AB  - Europe has played a major role in dog evolution, harbouring the oldest
      uncontested Palaeolithic remains and having been the centre of modern dog breed
      creation. Here we sequence the genomes of an Early and End Neolithic dog from
      Germany, including a sample associated with an early European farming community. 
      Both dogs demonstrate continuity with each other and predominantly share ancestry
      with modern European dogs, contradicting a previously suggested Late Neolithic
      population replacement. We find no genetic evidence to support the recent
      hypothesis proposing dual origins of dog domestication. By calibrating the
      mutation rate using our oldest dog, we narrow the timing of dog domestication to 
      20,000–40,000 years ago. Interestingly, we do not observe the extreme copy number
      expansion of the AMY2B gene characteristic of modern dogs that has previously
      been proposed as an adaptation to a starch-rich diet driven by the widespread
      adoption of agriculture in the Neolithic.

TI  - Misuse of emergent healthcare in contemporary Japan.
LID - 23
AB  - Background: Medical care is obviously an important public service to ensure the
      health of a nation; however, medical resources are not always used appropriately.
      ‘Convenience-store consultations’ and inappropriate ambulance transportation
      represent instances of such improper use by contemporary Japanese citizens in
      recent years. This article illustrates two examples of misuse and discusses
      potential countermeasures by considering factors contributing to these
      behaviours. Main body: From both public and medical perspectives, these patient
      behaviours are problematic, causing potential harm to others, negative
      consequences to such patients themselves, exhaustion of healthcare staff, and
      breakdown of emergency medical services. Although citizens need to recognize the 
      public nature and scarcity of medical care, the more immediate need may be to
      identify and to remove personal and social causes inducing such misuse. In
      addition, healthcare professionals should become more trustworthy. To combat
      these issues, one-sided penalties such as accusations or sanctions for patients
      who misuse the system cannot be justified in principle. If measures taken to
      prevent misuse are ineffective, imposing surcharges or restricting consultations 
      may be considered official policy, but these are not acceptable for several
      reasons. Conclusion: For now, we conclude that we must rely on the spontaneous
      motivation of patients who engage in ‘convenience-store consultations’ and
      ambulance transportation instead of taking a taxi.

TI  - Induced plant defences in biological control of arthropod pests: a double‐edged
      sword.
PG  - 1780-8
AB  - Biological control is an important ecosystem service delivered by natural
      enemies. Together with breeding for plant defence, it constitutes one of the most
      promising alternatives to pesticides for controlling herbivores in sustainable
      crop production. Especially induced plant defences may be promising targets in
      plant breeding for resistance against arthropod pests. Because they are activated
      upon herbivore damage, costs are only incurred when defence is needed. Moreover, 
      they can be more specific than constitutive defences. Nevertheless, inducible
      defence traits that are harming plant pest organisms may interfere with
      biological control agents, such as predators and parasitoids. Despite the vast
      fundamental knowledge on plant defence mechanisms and their effects on natural
      enemies, our understanding of the feasibility of combining biological control
      with induced plant defence in practice is relatively poor. In this review, we
      focus on arthropod pest control and present the most important features of
      biological control with natural enemies and of induced plant defence.
      Furthermore, we show potential synergies and conflicts among them and, finally,
      identify gaps and list opportunities for their combined use in crop protection.
      We suggest that breeders should focus on inducible resistance traits that are
      compatible with the natural enemies of arthropod pests, specifically traits that 
      help communities of natural enemies to build up. © 2017 The Authors. Pest

TI  - Phylogenetic evidence for the ancient Himalayan wolf: towards a clarification of 
      its taxonomic status based on genetic sampling from western Nepal.
LID - 170186
AB  - Wolves in the Himalayan region form a monophyletic lineage distinct from the
      present-day Holarctic grey wolf Canis lupus spp. (Linnaeus 1758) found across
      Eurasia and North America. Here, we analyse phylogenetic relationships and the
      geographic distribution of mitochondrial DNA haplotypes of the contemporary
      Himalayan wolf (proposed in previous studies as Canis himalayensis) found in
      Central Asia. We combine genetic data from a living Himalayan wolf population
      collected in northwestern Nepal in this study with already published genetic
      data, and confirm the Himalayan wolf lineage based on mitochondrial genomic data 
      (508 bp cytochrome b and 242 bp D-loop), and X- and Y-linked zinc-finger protein 
      gene (ZFX and ZFY) sequences. We then compare the genetic profile of the
      Himalayan wolf lineage found in northwestern Nepal with canid reference sequences
      from around the globe with maximum likelihood and Bayesian phylogeny building
      methods to demonstrate that the Himalayan wolf forms a distinct monophyletic
      clade supported by posterior probabilities/bootstrap for D-loop of greater than
      0.92/85 and cytochrome b greater than 0.99/93. The Himalayan wolf shows a unique 
      Y-chromosome (ZFY) haplotype, and shares an X-chromosome haplotype (ZFX) with the
      newly postulated African wolf. Our results imply that the Himalayan wolf
      distribution range extends from the Himalayan range north across the Tibetan
      Plateau up to the Qinghai Lakes region in Qinghai Province in the People's
      Republic of China. Based on its phylogenetic distinction and its older age of
      divergence relative to the Holarctic grey wolf, the Himalayan wolf merits formal 
      classification as a distinct taxon of special conservation concern.

TI  - The bear in Eurasian plant names: motivations and models.
LID - 14
AB  - Ethnolinguistic studies are important for understanding an ethnic group’s ideas
      on the world, expressed in its language. Comparing corresponding aspects of such 
      knowledge might help clarify problems of origin for certain concepts and words,
      e.g. whether they form common heritage, have an independent origin, are
      borrowings, or calques. The current study was conducted on the material in
      Slavonic, Baltic, Germanic, Romance, Finno-Ugrian, Turkic and Albanian languages.
      The bear was chosen as being a large, dangerous animal, important in traditional 
      culture, whose name is widely reflected in folk plant names. The phytonyms for
      comparison were mostly obtained from dictionaries and other publications, and
      supplemented with data from databases, the co-authors’ field data, and archival
      sources (dialect and folklore materials). More than 1200 phytonym use records
      (combinations of a local name and a meaning) for 364 plant and fungal taxa were
      recorded to help find out the reasoning behind bear-nomination in various
      languages, as well as differences and similarities between the patterns among
      them. Among the most common taxa with bear-related phytonyms were Arctostaphylos 
      uva-ursi (L.) Spreng., Heracleum sphondylium L., Acanthus mollis L., and Allium
      ursinum L., with Latin loan translation contributing a high proportion of the
      phytonyms. Some plants have many and various bear-related phytonyms, while others
      have only one or two bear names. Features like form and/or surface generated the 
      richest pool of names, while such features as colour seemed to provoke rather few
      associations with bears. The unevenness of bear phytonyms in the chosen languages
      was not related to the size of the language nor the present occurence of the
      Brown Bear in the region. However, this may, at least to certain extent, be
      related to the amount of the historical ethnolinguistic research done on the
      selected languages.

TI  - Constructing abortion as a social problem: “Sex selection” and the British
      abortion debate.
PG  - 15-33
AB  - Between February 2012 and March 2015, the claim that sex selection abortion was
      taking place in Britain and that action needed to be taken to stop it dominated
      debate in Britain about abortion. Situating an analysis in sociological and
      social psychological approaches to the construction of social problems,
      particularly those considering “feminised” re-framings of anti-abortion
      arguments, this paper presents an account of this debate. Based on analysis of
      media coverage, Parliamentary debate and official documents, we focus on claims
      about grounds (evidence) made to sustain the case that sex selection abortion is 
      a British social problem and highlight how abortion was problematised in new
      ways. Perhaps most notable, we argue, was the level of largely unchallenged
      vilification of abortion doctors and providers, on the grounds that they are both
      law violators and participants in acts of discrimination and violence against
      women, especially those of Asian heritage. We draw attention to the role of
      claims made by feminists in the media and in Parliament about “gendercide” as
      part of this process and argue that those supportive of access to abortion need
      to critically assess both this aspect of the events and also consider arguments
      about the problems of “medical power” in the light of what took place.

TI  - Competition between apex predators? Brown bears decrease wolf kill rate on two
      continents.
LID - 20162368
AB  - Trophic interactions are a fundamental topic in ecology, but we know little about
      how competition between apex predators affects predation, the mechanism driving
      top-down forcing in ecosystems. We used long-term datasets from Scandinavia
      (Europe) and Yellowstone National Park (North America) to evaluate how grey wolf 
      (Canis lupus) kill rate was affected by a sympatric apex predator, the brown bear
      (Ursus arctos). We used kill interval (i.e. the number of days between
      consecutive ungulate kills) as a proxy of kill rate. Although brown bears can
      monopolize wolf kills, we found no support in either study system for the common 
      assumption that they cause wolves to kill more often. On the contrary, our
      results showed the opposite effect. In Scandinavia, wolf packs sympatric with
      brown bears killed less often than allopatric packs during both spring (after
      bear den emergence) and summer. Similarly, the presence of bears at wolf-killed
      ungulates was associated with wolves killing less often during summer in
      Yellowstone. The consistency in results between the two systems suggests that
      brown bear presence actually reduces wolf kill rate. Our results suggest that the
      influence of predation on lower trophic levels may depend on the composition of
      predator communities.

TI  - Learning from patients: trainers’ use of narratives for learning and teaching.
LID - bjgpopen17X100581
AB  - Background: There is a growing interest in how doctors learn from narratives
      about individual cases, reflected, for example, in the use of e-portfolios. Aim: 
      This study aimed to evaluate how GP trainers conceptualised ‘learning from
      patients’, and what use they currently made of narrative recounts in training.
      Design & setting: Thematic analysis (TA) and corpus-linguistic (CL) analysis,
      with data collected from a convenience sample of trainers in the UK, Ireland, and
      Spain. Method: GP trainers in the three settings were contacted, and volunteers
      recruited (22 in UK, 24 in Ireland, and 16 in Spain). Volunteers were interviewed
      and asked to offer a narrative about ‘a patient you learned from’ and whether
      they used narratives as a training device. Results: There were no differences
      between settings. Trainers described an engaged and personal relationship with
      patients. They described learning about themselves, the human condition, and
      about how to live and die well. Their narratives were structured in various ways.
      At times, they led to precise conclusions: at times, they were perceived as
      meaningful, but resisting analysis. As regards teaching through narrative, it was
      reported as commonly used, but present practice appears ad hoc rather than
      planned. Discussion: The lack of difference between settings suggests a degree of
      commonality about how trainers perceive learning and teaching in the areas
      explored, but cannot be generalised further. The level of personal engagement was
      more than anticipated, and suggests the label ‘doctor–patient relationship’, as
      the term is used, may not be adequate to describe the nature of some
      interactions.

TI  - Clinician Perspectives of Barriers to Effective Implementation of a Rapid
      Response System in an Academic Health Centre: A Focus Group Study.
PG  - 447-56
AB  - Background: Systemic and structural issues of rapid response system (RRS) models 
      can hinder implementation. This study sought to understand the ways in which
      acute care clinicians (physicians and nurses) experience and negotiate care for
      deteriorating patients within the RRS. Methods: Physicians and nurses working
      within an Australian academic health centre within a jurisdictional-based model
      of clinical governance participated in focus group interviews. Verbatim
      transcripts were analysed using thematic content analysis. Results: Thirty-four
      participants (21 physicians and 13 registered nurses [RNs]) participated in six
      focus groups over five weeks in 2014. Implementing the RRS in daily practice was 
      a process of informal communication and negotiation in spite of standardised
      protocols. Themes highlighted several systems or organisational-level barriers to
      an effective RRS, including (1) responsibility is inversely proportional to
      clinical experience; (2) actions around system flexibility contribute to
      deviation from protocol; (3) misdistribution of resources leads to perceptions of
      inadequate staffing levels inhibiting full optimisation of the RRS; and (4) poor 
      communication and documentation of RRS increases clinician workloads. Conclusion:
      Implementing a RRS is complex and multifactorial, influenced by various inter-
      and intra-professional factors, staffing models and organisational culture. The
      RRS is not a static model; it is both reflexive and iterative, perpetually
      transforming to meet healthcare consumer and provider demands and local unit
      contexts and needs. Requiring more than just a strong initial implementation
      phase, new models of care such as a RRS demand good governance processes, ongoing
      support and regular evaluation and refinement. Cultural, organizational and
      professional factors, as well as systems-based processes, require consideration
      if RRSs are to achieve their intended outcomes in dynamic healthcare settings

TI  - When a vehicle becomes a weapon: intentional vehicular assaults in Israel.
LID - 149
AB  - Background: We have recently witnessed an epidemic of intentional vehicular
      assaults (IVA) aimed at pedestrians. We hypothesized that IVA are associated with
      a specific injury pattern and severity. Methods: Retrospective analysis of
      prospectively acquired data of patients injured following IVA from October 2008
      to May 2016 who were admitted to the Hadassah Level I trauma center in Jerusalem,
      Israel. Comparison of injury parameters and outcome caused by vehicular attacks
      to non-intentional pedestrian trauma (PT). Measured outcomes included ISS, AIS,
      injury pattern, ICU and blood requirements, participating teams, length of stay, 
      and mortality. Results: There were 26 patients in the IVA group. Mean age in the 
      IVA group was significantly younger and there were more males compared to the PT 
      group (24.7 ± 13.3 years vs. 48.3 ± 21.3, and 81% vs. 52%, respectively,
      p < 0.01). Lower extremity (77% of patients), followed by head (58%) and facial
      (54%) injuries were most commonly injured in the IVA group, and this was
      significantly different from the pattern of injury in the PT group (54, 35, and
      28%, respectively, p < 0.05). Mean ISS and median head AIS were significantly
      higher in the IVA group compared with the PT group (23.2 ± 12.8 vs. 15.4 ± 13.8, 
      p = 0.012, and 4.5 vs. 3, p = 0.003, respectively). ICU admission and blood
      requirement were significantly higher in the IVA group (69% vs. 38%, and 50% vs. 
      19%, p < 0.01). Mortality was significantly higher in the IVA group (4 patients, 
      15%, vs. 3 patients, 4%, respectively, p = 0.036) and was caused by severe head
      trauma in all cases. Discussion: The severity of injury and mortality rate
      following IVA are higher compared with pedestrian injury. The pattern of injury
      following IVA is significantly different from non-intentional pedestrian trauma. 
      Conclusions: IVA results in higher mortality than conventional pedestrian trauma 
      secondary to more severe head injury. More hospital resources are required
      following IVA than following conventional road traffic accidents.
