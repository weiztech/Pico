TI  - Does 3D-Assisted Operative Treatment of Pelvic Ring Injuries Improve Patient
      Outcome?—A Systematic Review of the Literature.
LID - 930
AB  - Background: There has been an exponential growth in the use of advanced
      technologies for three-dimensional (3D) virtual pre- and intra-operative planning
      of pelvic ring injury surgery but potential benefits remain unclear. The purpose 
      of this study was to evaluate differences in intra- and post-operative results
      between 3D and conventional (2D) surgery. Methods: A systematic review was
      performed including published studies between 1 January 2010 and 22 May 2020 on
      all available 3D techniques in pelvic ring injury surgery. Studies were assessed 
      for their methodological quality according to the Modified McMaster Critical
      Review form. Differences in operation time, blood loss, fluoroscopy time, screw
      malposition rate, fracture reduction and functional outcome between 3D-assisted
      and conventional (2D) pelvic injury treatment were evaluated and a best-evidence 
      synthesis was performed. Results: Eighteen studies fulfilled the inclusion
      criteria, evaluating a total of 988 patients. Overall quality was moderate.
      Regarding intra-operative results of 3D-assisted versus conventional surgery: The
      weighted mean operation time per screw was 43 min versus 52 min; for overall
      operation time 126 min versus 141 min; blood loss 275 ± 197 mL versus 549 ± 404
      mL; fluoroscopy time 74 s versus 125 s and fluoroscopy frequency 29 ± 4 versus 63
      ± 3. In terms of post-operative outcomes of 3D-assisted versus conventional
      surgery: weighted mean screw malposition rate was 8% versus 18%; quality of
      fracture reduction measured by the total excellent/good rate by Matta was 86%
      versus 82% and Majeed excellent/good rate 88% versus 83%. Conclusion: The
      3D-assisted surgery technologies seem to have a positive effect on operation
      time, blood loss, fluoroscopy dose, time and frequency as well as accuracy of
      screw placement. No improvement in clinical outcome in terms of fracture
      reduction and functional outcome has been established so far. Due to a wide range
      of methodological quality and heterogeneity between the included studies, results
      should be interpreted with caution.

TI  - Whose shoulders is health research standing on? Determining the key actors and
      contents of the prevailing biomedical research agenda.
LID - e0249661
AB  - Background: Conflicts of interest in biomedical research can influence research
      results and drive research agendas away from public health priorities. Previous
      agenda-setting studies share two shortfalls: they only account for direct
      connections between academic institutions and firms, as well as potential bias
      based on researchers’ personal beliefs. This paper’s goal is to determine the key
      actors and contents of the prevailing health and biomedical sciences (HBMS)
      research agenda, overcoming these shortfalls. Methods: We performed a
      bibliometric and lexical analysis of 95,415 scientific articles published between
      1999 and 2018 in the highest impact factor journals within HBMS, using the Web of
      Science database and the CorText platform. HBMS’s prevailing knowledge network of
      institutions was proxied with network maps where nodes represent affiliations and
      edges the most frequent co-authorships. The content of the prevailing HBMS
      research agenda was depicted through network maps of prevalent multi-terms found 
      in titles, keywords, and abstracts. Results: The HBMS research agendas of large
      private firms and leading academic institutions are intertwined. The prevailing
      HBMS agenda is mostly based on molecular biology (40% of the most frequent
      multi-terms), with an inclination towards cancer and cardiovascular research (15 
      and 8% of the most frequent multi-terms, respectively). Studies on pathogens and 
      biological vectors related to recent epidemics are marginal (1% of the most
      frequent multi-terms). Content of the prevailing HBMS research agenda prioritizes
      research on pharmacological intervention over research on socio-environmental
      factors influencing disease onset or progression and overlooks, among others, the
      study of infectious diseases. Conclusions: Pharmaceutical corporations contribute
      to set HBMS’s prevailing research agenda, which is mainly focused on a few
      diseases and research topics. A more balanced research agenda, together with
      epistemological approaches that consider socio-environmental factors associated
      with disease spreading, could contribute to being better prepared to prevent and 
      treat more diverse pathologies and to improve overall health outcomes.

TI  - A Bibliometric Network Analysis of Coronavirus during the First Eight Months of
      COVID-19 in 2020.
LID - 952
AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has affected all aspects of society. Researchers worldwide 
      have been working to provide new solutions to and better understanding of this
      coronavirus. In this research, our goal was to perform a Bibliometric Network
      Analysis (BNA) to investigate the strategic themes, thematic evolution structure 
      and trends of coronavirus during the first eight months of COVID-19 in the Web of
      Science (WoS) database in 2020. To do this, 14,802 articles were analyzed, with
      the support of the SciMAT software. This analysis highlights 24 themes, of which 
      11 of the more important ones were discussed in-depth. The thematic evolution
      structure shows how the themes are evolving over time, and the most developed and
      future trends of coronavirus with focus on COVID-19 were visually depicted. The
      results of the strategic diagram highlight ‘CHLOROQUINE’, ‘ANXIETY’, ‘PREGNANCY’ 
      and ‘ACUTE-RESPIRATORY-SYNDROME’, among others, as the clusters with the highest 
      number of associated citations. The thematic evolution. structure presented two
      thematic areas: “Damage prevention and containment of COVID-19” and
      “Comorbidities and diseases caused by COVID-19”, which provides new perspectives 
      and futures trends of the field. These results will form the basis for future
      research and guide decision-making in coronavirus focused on COVID-19 research
      and treatments.

TI  - Circadian actions of orexins on the retinorecipient lateral geniculate complex in
      rat.
PG  - 231-52
AB  - Key points: Rhythmic processes in living organisms are controlled by biological
      clocks. The orexinergic system of the lateral hypothalamus carries circadian
      information to provide arousal for the brain during the active phase.Here, we
      show that orexins exert an excitatory action in three parts of the lateral
      geniculate nucleus (LGN), in particular upon directly retinorecipient neurons in 
      the non‐image forming visual structures.We provide evidence for the high
      nocturnal levels of orexins with stable circadian expression of predominant
      orexin receptor 2 in the LGN.Our data additionally establish the convergence of
      orexinergic and pituitary adenylate cyclase (PAC)‐activating peptide/PAC1
      receptor systems (used by melanopsin‐expressing retinal ganglion cells), which
      directly regulates responses to the retinal input.These results help us better
      understand circadian orexinergic control over the non‐image forming subcortical
      visual system, forming the animal's preparedness for the behaviourally active
      night. Abstract: The orexinergic system of the lateral hypothalamus is tightly
      interlinked with the master circadian clock and displays daily variation in
      activity to provide arousal‐related excitation for the plethora of brain
      structures in a circadian manner. Here, using a combination of
      electrophysiological, optogenetic, histological, molecular and neuronal tracing
      methods, we explore a particular link between orexinergic and visual systems in
      rat. The results of the present study demonstrate that orexinergic fibre density 
      at the area of subcortical visual system exerts a clear day to night variability,
      reaching a maximum at behaviourally active night. We also show pronounced
      electrophysiological activations of neurons in the lateral geniculate nucleus by 
      orexin A through 24 h, via identified distinct orexin receptors, with the
      ventrolateral geniculate displaying a daily cycle of responsiveness. In addition,
      for the first time, we provide a direct evidence for orexins to act on
      retinorecipient neurons with a high convergence of orexinergic and putatively
      retinal pituitary adenylate cyclase (PAC)‐activating peptide/PAC1 receptor
      systems. Altogether, the present study ties orexins to non‐image forming visual
      structures with implications for circadian orexinergic modulation of neurons,
      which process information on ambient light levels.

TI  - Image Fusion During Standard and Complex Endovascular Aortic Repair, to Fuse or
      Not to Fuse? A Meta-analysis and Additional Data From a Single-Center
      Retrospective Cohort.
PG  - 78-92
AB  - Purpose:: To determine if image fusion will reduce contrast volume, radiation
      dose, and fluoroscopy and procedure times in standard and complex
      (fenestrated/branched) endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR). Materials and
      Methods:: A search of the PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane databases was performed in
      December 2019 to identify articles describing results of standard and complex
      EVAR procedures using image fusion compared with a control group. Study
      selection, data extraction, and assessment of the methodological quality of the
      included publications were performed by 2 reviewers working independently.
      Primary outcomes of the pooled analysis were contrast volume, fluoroscopy time,
      radiation dose, and procedure time. Eleven articles were identified comprising
      1547 patients. Data on 140 patients satisfying the study inclusion criteria were 
      added from the authors’ center. Mean differences (MDs) are presented with the 95%
      confidence interval (CI). Results:: For standard EVAR, contrast volume and
      procedure time showed a significant reduction with an MD of −29 mL (95% CI −40.5 
      to −18.5, p<0.001) and −11 minutes (95% CI −21.0 to −1.8, p<0.01), respectively. 
      For complex EVAR, significant reductions in favor of image fusion were found for 
      contrast volume (MD −79 mL, 95% CI −105.7 to −52.4, p<0.001), fluoroscopy time
      (MD −14 minutes, 95% CI −24.2 to −3.5, p<0.001), and procedure time (MD −52
      minutes, 95% CI −75.7 to −27.9, p<0.001). Conclusion:: The results of this
      meta-analysis confirm that image fusion significantly reduces contrast volume,
      fluoroscopy time, and procedure time in complex EVAR but only contrast volume and
      procedure time for standard EVAR. Though a reduction was suggested, the radiation
      dose was not significantly affected by the use of fusion imaging in either
      standard or complex EVAR.

TI  - Petroclival meningiomas: radiological features essential for surgeons.
LID - 907
AB  - Petroclival meningiomas (PCMs) have always been a challenge for surgeons because 
      of their difficult anatomical location. The role of radiology in providing
      precise indications regarding the tumour site and aggressiveness plays a major
      part in guiding the subsequent therapeutic process. The purpose of this review is
      to provide a set of the main radiological features helpful in the management of
      PCMs towards the most correct therapeutic approach.We aim to offer a radiological
      overview to allow the patient to be directed to surgery with the least possible
      risk of complications.

TI  - Consensus statements on the management of clinically localized prostate cancer
      from the Hong Kong Urological Association and the Hong Kong Society of
      Uro‐Oncology.
PG  - 221-41
AB  - Objective: To formulate consensus statements to facilitate physician management
      strategies for patients with clinically localized prostate cancer (PCa) in Hong
      Kong by jointly convening a panel of 12 experts from the two local professional
      organizations representing PCa specialists, who had previously established
      consensus statements on the management of metastatic PCa for the locality.
      Methods: Through a series of meetings, the panellists discussed their clinical
      experience and the published evidence regarding various areas of the management
      of localized PCa, then drafted consensus statements. At the final meeting, each
      drafted statement was voted on by every panellist based on its practicability of 
      recommendation in the locality. Results: A total of 76 consensus statements were 
      ultimately accepted and established by panel voting. Conclusion: Derived from the
      recent evidence and major overseas guidelines, along with local clinical
      experience and practicability, the consensus statements were aimed to serve as a 
      practical reference for physicians in Hong Kong for the management of localized
      PCa.

TI  - Predicting Thromboembolic and Bleeding Event Risk in Patients with Nonvalvular
      Atrial Fibrillation: A Systematic Review.
PG  - 2171-87
AB  - Background:: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a common cardiac arrhythmia that
      increases the risk of stroke. Medical therapy for decreasing stroke risk involves
      anticoagulation, which may increase bleeding risk for certain patients. In
      determining optimal therapy for stroke prevention for patients with AF,
      clinicians use tools with various clinical, imaging, and patient characteristics 
      to weigh stroke risk against therapy-associated bleeding risk. Aim:: Review
      published literature and summarize available risk stratification tools for stroke
      and bleeding prediction in patients with AF. Methods:: We searched for
      English-language studies in PubMed®, Embase®, and the Cochrane Database of
      Systematic Reviews published between January 1, 2000, and February 14, 2018. Two 
      reviewers screened citations for studies that examined tools for predicting
      thromboembolic and bleeding risks in patients with AF. Data regarding study
      design, patient characteristics, interventions, outcomes, quality and
      applicability were extracted. Results:: 61 studies were relevant to predicting
      thromboembolic risk and 38 to predicting bleeding risk. Data suggest that CHADS2,
      CHA2DS2-VASc, and ABC risk scores have the best evidence predicting
      thromboembolic risk (moderate strength of evidence for limited prediction ability
      of each score) and that HAS-BLED has the best evidence for predicting bleeding
      risk (moderate strength of evidence). Limitations:: Studies were heterogeneous in
      methodology and populations of interest, setting, interventions, and outcomes
      analyzed. Conclusion:: CHADS2, CHA2DS2-VASc, and ABC stroke have the best
      prediction for stroke events, and HAS-BLED provides the best prediction for
      bleeding risk. Future studies should define the role of imaging tools and
      biomarkers in enhancing the accuracy of risk prediction tools. Primary Funding

TI  - “We might get a lot more families who will agree”: Muslim and Jewish perspectives
      on less invasive perinatal and paediatric autopsy.
LID - e0202023
AB  - Background: Perinatal and paediatric autopsy rates are at historically low levels
      with declining uptake due to dislike of the invasiveness of the procedure, and
      religious objections particularly amongst Muslim and Jewish parents. Less
      invasive methods of autopsy including imaging with and without tissue sampling
      have been shown to be feasible alternatives. We sought to investigate attitudes
      including religious permissibility and potential uptake amongst members of the
      Muslim and Jewish communities in the United Kingdom. Methods: Semi-structured
      interviews with religious and faith-based authorities (n = 16) and bereaved
      parents from the Jewish community (n = 3) as well as 10 focus groups with
      community members (60 Muslim participants and 16 Jewish participants) were
      conducted. Data were analysed using thematic analysis to identify key themes.
      Findings: Muslim and Jewish religious and faith-based authorities agreed that
      non-invasive autopsy with imaging was religiously permissible because it did not 
      require incisions or interference with the body. A minimally invasive approach
      was less acceptable as it still required incisions to the body, although in those
      circumstances where it was required by law it was more acceptable than a full
      autopsy. During focus group discussions with community members, the majority of
      participants indicated they would potentially consent to a non-invasive autopsy
      if the body could be returned for burial within 24 hours, or if a family had
      experienced multiple fetal/pregnancy losses and the information gained might be
      useful in future pregnancies. Minimally invasive autopsy was less acceptable but 
      around half of participants might consent if a non-invasive autopsy was not
      suitable, with the exception of the Jewish Haredi community who unanimously
      stated they would decline this alternative. Conclusions: Our research suggests
      less invasive autopsy offers a viable alternative to many Muslim and Jewish
      parents in the UK who currently decline a full autopsy. The findings may be of
      importance to other countries with significant Muslim and/or Jewish communities
      as well as to other religious communities where concerns around autopsy exist.
      Awareness-raising amongst religious leaders and community members will be
      important if these methods become routinely available.

TI  - Adrenal masses: A urological perspective.
PG  - 248-55
AB  - Adrenal masses have become increasingly common due to widespread use of sectional
      imaging. Urologists are commonly faced with management decisions in patients with
      adrenal masses. Systemic review of available literature related to surgical
      adrenal disease was performed to summarise the most pertinent information related
      to adrenal masses, diagnostic evaluation and surgical treatment. Detailed
      hormonal evaluation of adrenal disease was not included, being part of
      endocrinological rather than urological practice. Adrenal masses exhibit a wide
      spectrum of presentation and pathology, and treatment requires different surgical
      techniques. Full understanding of the pathology and management of such masses
      should be completely familiar to practicing urologists.
