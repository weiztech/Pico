TI  - The Use of Indocyanine Green Fluorescence Angiography in Pediatric Surgery: A
      Systematic Review and Narrative Analysis.
LID - 736242
AB  - Purpose: Indocyanine green fluorescence angiography (ICG-FA) is a validated
      non-invasive imaging technique used to assess tissue vascularization and guide
      intraoperative decisions in many surgical fields including plastic surgery,
      neurosurgery, and general surgery. While this technology is well-established in
      adult surgery, it remains sparsely used in pediatric surgery. Our aim was to
      systematically review and provide an overview of all available evidence on the
      perioperative use of indocyanine green fluorescence angiography in pediatric
      surgical patients.Methods: We conducted a systematic review with narrative
      synthesis in conformity with the PRISMA guidelines using PubMed, Medline, All EBM
      Reviews, EMBASE, PsycINFO, and CINAHL COMPLETE databases to identify articles
      describing the perioperative use of ICG-FA in pediatric patients. Two independent
      authors screened all included articles for eligibility and inclusion criteria. We
      extracted data on study design, demographics, surgical indications, indocyanine
      green dose, and perioperative outcomes. We developed a risk of bias assessment
      tool to evaluate the methodological quality of included studies.Results: Of 1,031
      articles retrieved, a total of 64 articles published between 2003 and 2020 were
      included reporting on 664 pediatric patients. Most articles were case reports and
      case series (n = 36; 56%). No adverse events related to ICG-FA were reported in
      the included articles. Risk of bias was high. We did not conduct a meta-analysis 
      given the heterogeneous nature of the populations, interventions, and outcome
      measures. A narrative synthesis is presented.Conclusion: Indocyanine green
      fluorescence angiography is a safe imaging technology and its use is increasing
      rapidly in pediatric surgical specialties. However, the quality of evidence
      supporting this trend currently appears low. Case-control and randomized trials
      are needed to determine the adequate pediatric dose and to confirm the potential 
      benefits of ICG-FA in pediatric surgical patients.Systematic Review Registration:
      This study was registered on Prospero a priori, identifier: CRD42020151981.
