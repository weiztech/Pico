TI  - Intraoperative Laser Speckle Contrast Imaging For Real-Time Visualization of
      Cerebral Blood Flow in Cerebrovascular Surgery: Results From Pre-Clinical
      Studies.
LID - 7614
AB  - Cerebrovascular surgery can benefit from an intraoperative system that conducts
      continuous monitoring of cerebral blood flow (CBF). Such a system must be handy, 
      non-invasive, and directly integrated into the surgical workflow. None of the
      currently available techniques, considered alone, meets all these criteria. Here,
      we introduce the SurgeON™ system: a newly developed non-invasive modular tool
      which transmits high-resolution Laser Speckle Contrast Imaging (LSCI) directly
      onto the eyepiece of the surgical microscope. In preclinical rodent and rabbit
      models, we show that this system enabled the detection of acute perfusion changes
      as well as the recording of temporal response patterns and degrees of flow
      changes in various microvascular settings, such as middle cerebral artery
      occlusion, femoral artery clipping, and complete or incomplete cortical vessel
      cautery. During these procedures, a real-time visualization of vasculature and
      CBF was available in high spatial resolution through the eyepiece as a direct
      overlay on the live morphological view of the surgical field. Upon comparison
      with indocyanine green angiography videoangiography (ICG-VA) imaging, also
      operable via SurgeON, we found that direct-LSCI can produce greater information
      than ICG-VA and that continuous display of data is advantageous for performing
      immediate LSCI-guided adjustments in real time.

TI  - Real-time Indocyanine Green Videolymphography Navigation for Lymphaticovenular
      Anastomosis.
LID - e2253
AB  - Indocyanine green (ICG) lymphography is a useful imaging modality for evaluation 
      of lymphedema and detection of lymphatic vessels. It also allows us to ensure
      patency of the anastomosed vessels intraoperatively. However, strong light from
      the operating microscope usually disturbs ICG fluorescence imaging. Only some
      built-in ICG camera systems with specific operating microscopes make real-time
      ICG lymphography possible in lymphaticovenular anastomosis (LVA). We applied a
      new high-resolution ICG videolymphography system, which is separated from the
      operating microscope. Because the system can divide near-infrared fluorescence
      light of ICG from visible light of the operating microscope, real-time ICG
      videolymphography-navigated LVA under operating microscope illumination is
      possible regardless types of operating microscopes. The study involved 10
      patients with upper extremity lymphedema characterized by International Society
      of Lymphology stage 2 and treated by 3 lymphaticovenular anastomoses at the
      forearm (30 lymphaticovenular anastomoses incorporating 30 lymphatic vessels)
      under real-time ICG videolymphography. The rate of intraoperative detection of
      lymphatic vessels using real-time ICG videolymphography was 86.7% (0.25–0.85 mm
      in diameter), and that of lymph flow through the lymphaticovenular anastomoses
      was 76.7%. None of lymphatic vessels and no flow were detected under the
      microscope light by means of another non-built-in ICG lymphography camera.
      Real-time ICG videolymphography in LVA is beneficial, because the surgeon could
      find lymphatic vessels easily by checking dual images of original view and ICG
      fluorescent view and ensure accuracy of the LVA in a suture by a suture without
      any pauses of the surgical procedures.

TI  - Viability of five different pre- and intraoperative imaging methods for
      autologous breast reconstruction.
PG  - 326-33
AB  - Background: Autologous breast reconstruction is an integral part in the treatment
      of breast cancer. While computed tomography angiography (CTA) is an established
      preoperative diagnostic tool for microsurgeons, no study has so far evaluated and
      compared five different imaging methods and their value for the reconstructive
      team. In order to determine the feasibility of each of the tools for routine or
      specialized diagnostic application, the methods’ efficiency and informative value
      were analyzed. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed imaging data of 41 patients
      used for perforator location and assessment for regional perfusion and vessel
      patency in patients undergoing autologous breast reconstruction with deep
      inferior epigastric perforator flap (DIEP), transverse rectus abdominis muscle
      flap (TRAM), or transverse myocutaneous gracilis flap (TMG). Five different
      imaging techniques were used: hand held Doppler (HHD), CT angiography (CTA),
      macroscopic indocyanine green (ICG) video angiography, microscope-integrated ICG 
      video angiography, and laser Doppler imaging (LDI). Results: CTA proved to be the
      best tool for preoperative determination of the highly variable anatomy of the
      abdominal region, whereas HHD showed the same information on perforator
      localization with some false-positive results. Intraoperative HHD was an
      excellent tool for dissection and vessel patency judgment. Microscope-integrated 
      ICG was an excellent tool to document the patency of microanastomoses. In our
      series, macroscopic perfusion measurement with ICG or LDI was only justified in
      special situations, where information on perfusion of abdominal or mastectomy
      flaps was required. LDI did not add any additional information. Conclusion:
      Preoperative assessment should be performed by CTA with verification of the
      perforator location by HHD. Intraoperative HHD and microscope-integrated ICG
      contribute most toward the evaluation of vessel patency. ICG and LDI should only 
      be used for special indications.
