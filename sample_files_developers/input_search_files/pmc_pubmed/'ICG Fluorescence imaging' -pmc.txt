TI  - Heparin-binding motif mutations of human diamine oxidase allow the development of
      a first-in-class histamine-degrading biopharmaceutical.
LID - e68542
AB  - Background:: Excessive plasma histamine concentrations cause symptoms in mast
      cell activation syndrome, mastocytosis, or anaphylaxis. Anti-histamines are often
      insufficiently efficacious. Human diamine oxidase (hDAO) can rapidly degrade
      histamine and therefore represents a promising new treatment strategy for
      conditions with pathological histamine concentrations. Methods:: Positively
      charged amino acids of the heparin-binding motif of hDAO were replaced with polar
      serine or threonine residues. Binding to heparin and heparan sulfate, cellular
      internalization and clearance in rodents were examined. Results:: Recombinant
      hDAO is rapidly cleared from the circulation in rats and mice. After mutation of 
      the heparin-binding motif, binding to heparin and heparan sulfate was strongly
      reduced. The double mutant rhDAO-R568S/R571T showed minimal cellular uptake. The 
      short α-distribution half-life of the wildtype protein was eliminated, and the
      clearance was significantly reduced in rodents. Conclusions:: The successful
      decrease in plasma clearance of rhDAO by mutations of the heparin-binding motif
      with unchanged histamine-degrading activity represents the first step towards the
      development of rhDAO as a first-in-class biopharmaceutical to effectively treat
      diseases characterized by excessive histamine concentrations in plasma and
      tissues. Funding:: Austrian Science Fund (FWF) Hertha Firnberg program grant

TI  - Quantitative mapping of dense microtubule arrays in mammalian neurons.
LID - e67925
AB  - The neuronal microtubule cytoskeleton underlies the polarization and proper
      functioning of neurons, amongst others by providing tracks for motor proteins
      that drive intracellular transport. Different subsets of neuronal microtubules,
      varying in composition, stability, and motor preference, are known to exist, but 
      the high density of microtubules has so far precluded mapping their relative
      abundance and three-dimensional organization. Here, we use different
      super-resolution techniques (STED, Expansion Microscopy) to explore the nanoscale
      organization of the neuronal microtubule network in rat hippocampal neurons. This
      revealed that in dendrites acetylated microtubules are enriched in the core of
      the dendritic shaft, while tyrosinated microtubules are enriched near the plasma 
      membrane, thus forming a shell around the acetylated microtubules. Moreover,
      using a novel analysis pipeline we quantified the absolute number of acetylated
      and tyrosinated microtubules within dendrites and found that they account for
      65–75% and ~20–30% of all microtubules, respectively, leaving only few
      microtubules that do not fall in either category. Because these different
      microtubule subtypes facilitate different motor proteins, these novel insights
      help to understand the spatial regulation of intracellular transport.

TI  - An optogenetic method for interrogating YAP1 and TAZ nuclear–cytoplasmic
      shuttling.
LID - jcs253484
AB  - The shuttling of transcription factors and transcriptional regulators into and
      out of the nucleus is central to the regulation of many biological processes.
      Here we describe a new method for studying the rates of nuclear entry and exit of
      transcriptional regulators. A photo-responsive LOV (light–oxygen–voltage) domain 
      from Avena sativa is used to sequester fluorescently labelled transcriptional
      regulators YAP1 and TAZ (also known as WWTR1) on the surface of mitochondria and 
      to reversibly release them upon blue light illumination. After dissociation,
      fluorescent signals from the mitochondria, cytoplasm and nucleus are extracted by
      a bespoke app and used to generate rates of nuclear entry and exit. Using this
      method, we demonstrate that phosphorylation of YAP1 on canonical sites enhances
      its rate of nuclear export. Moreover, we provide evidence that, despite high
      intercellular variability, YAP1 import and export rates correlate within the same
      cell. By simultaneously releasing YAP1 and TAZ from sequestration, we show that
      their rates of entry and exit are correlated. Furthermore, combining the
      optogenetic release of YAP1 with lattice light-sheet microscopy reveals high
      heterogeneity of YAP1 dynamics within different cytoplasmic regions,
      demonstrating the utility and versatility of our tool to study protein
      dynamics.This article has an associated First Person interview with Anna M.

TI  - Combined FCS and PCH Analysis to Quantify Protein Dimerization in Living Cells.
LID - 7300
AB  - Protein dimerization plays a crucial role in the regulation of numerous
      biological processes. However, detecting protein dimers in a cellular environment
      is still a challenge. Here we present a methodology to measure the extent of
      dimerization of GFP-tagged proteins in living cells, using a combination of
      fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) and photon counting histogram (PCH)
      analysis of single-color fluorescence fluctuation data. We named this analysis
      method brightness and diffusion global analysis (BDGA) and adapted it for
      biological purposes. Using cell lysates containing different ratios of GFP and
      tandem-dimer GFP (diGFP), we show that the average brightness per particle is
      proportional to the fraction of dimer present. We further adapted this
      methodology for its application in living cells, and we were able to distinguish 
      GFP, diGFP, as well as ligand-induced dimerization of FKBP12 (FK506 binding
      protein 12)-GFP. While other analysis methods have only sporadically been used to
      study dimerization in living cells and may be prone to errors, this paper
      provides a robust approach for the investigation of any cytosolic protein using
      single-color fluorescence fluctuation spectroscopy.

TI  - Cellular dynamics of EMT: lessons from live in vivo imaging of embryonic
      development.
LID - 79
AB  - Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) refers to a process in which epithelial
      cells lose apical-basal polarity and loosen cell–cell junctions to take on
      mesenchymal cell morphologies and invasive properties that facilitate migration
      through extracellular matrix. EMT—and the reverse mesenchymal-epithelial
      transition (MET)—are evolutionarily conserved processes that are used throughout 
      embryonic development to drive tissue morphogenesis. During adult life, EMT is
      activated to close wounds after injury, but also can be used by cancers to
      promote metastasis. EMT is controlled by several mechanisms that depend on
      context. In response to cell–cell signaling and/or interactions with the local
      environment, cells undergoing EMT make rapid changes in kinase and adaptor
      proteins, adhesion and extracellular matrix molecules, and gene expression. Many 
      of these changes modulate localization, activity, or expression of cytoskeletal
      proteins that mediate cell shape changes and cell motility. Since cellular
      changes during EMT are highly dynamic and context-dependent, it is ideal to
      analyze this process in situ in living organisms. Embryonic development of model 
      organisms is amenable to live time-lapse microscopy, which provides an
      opportunity to watch EMT as it happens. Here, with a focus on functions of the
      actin cytoskeleton, I review recent examples of how live in vivo imaging of
      embryonic development has led to new insights into mechanisms of EMT. At the same
      time, I highlight specific developmental processes in model embryos—gastrulation 
      in fly and mouse embryos, and neural crest cell development in zebrafish and frog
      embryos—that provide in vivo platforms for visualizing cellular dynamics during
      EMT. In addition, I introduce Kupffer’s vesicle in the zebrafish embryo as a new 
      model system to investigate EMT and MET. I discuss how these systems have
      provided insights into the dynamics of adherens junction remodeling, planar cell 
      polarity signaling, cadherin functions, and cytoskeletal organization during EMT,
      which are not only important for understanding development, but also cancer
      progression. These findings shed light on mechanisms of actin cytoskeletal
      dynamics during EMT, and feature live in vivo imaging strategies that can be
      exploited in future work to identify new mechanisms of EMT and MET.Video

TI  - Reconciling functional differences in populations of neurons recorded with
      two-photon imaging and electrophysiology.
LID - e69068
AB  - Extracellular electrophysiology and two-photon calcium imaging are widely used
      methods for measuring physiological activity with single-cell resolution across
      large populations of cortical neurons. While each of these two modalities has
      distinct advantages and disadvantages, neither provides complete, unbiased
      information about the underlying neural population. Here, we compare evoked
      responses in visual cortex recorded in awake mice under highly standardized
      conditions using either imaging of genetically expressed GCaMP6f or
      electrophysiology with silicon probes. Across all stimulus conditions tested, we 
      observe a larger fraction of responsive neurons in electrophysiology and higher
      stimulus selectivity in calcium imaging, which was partially reconciled by
      applying a spikes-to-calcium forward model to the electrophysiology data.
      However, the forward model could only reconcile differences in responsiveness
      when restricted to neurons with low contamination and an event rate above a
      minimum threshold. This work established how the biases of these two modalities
      impact functional metrics that are fundamental for characterizing sensory-evoked 
      responses.

PG  - 1232-43
AB  - The CD2-CD58 recognition system promotes adhesion and signaling and counters
      exhaustion in human T cells. We found that CD2 localized to the outer edge of the
      mature immunological synapse (IS), with cellular or artificial APC, in a pattern 
      we refer to as a “CD2 corolla”. The corolla captured engaged CD28, ICOS, CD226
      and SLAM-F1 costimulators. The corolla amplified active phosphorylated Src-family
      kinases (pSFK), LAT and PLC-γ over T cell receptor (TCR) alone. CD2-CD58
      interactions in the corolla boosted signaling by 77% compared to central CD2-CD58
      interactions. Engaged PD-1 invaded the CD2 corolla and buffered CD2 mediated
      amplification of TCR signaling. CD2 numbers and motifs in its cytoplasmic tail
      controlled corolla formation. CD8+ tumor infiltrating lymphocytes displayed low
      expression of CD2 in the majority of colorectal, endometrial and ovarian cancer
      patients. CD2 down-regulation may attenuate anti-tumor T cell responses with
      implications for checkpoint immunotherapies.

TI  - Roadmap of Terahertz Imaging 2021.
LID - 4092
AB  - In this roadmap article, we have focused on the most recent advances in terahertz
      (THz) imaging with particular attention paid to the optimization and
      miniaturization of the THz imaging systems. Such systems entail enhanced
      functionality, reduced power consumption, and increased convenience, thus being
      geared toward the implementation of THz imaging systems in real operational
      conditions. The article will touch upon the advanced solid-state-based THz
      imaging systems, including room temperature THz sensors and arrays, as well as
      their on-chip integration with diffractive THz optical components. We will cover 
      the current-state of compact room temperature THz emission sources, both
      optolectronic and electrically driven; particular emphasis is attributed to the
      beam-forming role in THz imaging, THz holography and spatial filtering, THz
      nano-imaging, and computational imaging. A number of advanced THz techniques,
      such as light-field THz imaging, homodyne spectroscopy, and phase sensitive
      spectrometry, THz modulated continuous wave imaging, room temperature THz
      frequency combs, and passive THz imaging, as well as the use of artificial
      intelligence in THz data processing and optics development, will be reviewed.
      This roadmap presents a structured snapshot of current advances in THz imaging as
      of 2021 and provides an opinion on contemporary scientific and technological
      challenges in this field, as well as extrapolations of possible further evolution
      in THz imaging.

TI  - Organ geometry channels reproductive cell fate in the Arabidopsis ovule
      primordium.
LID - e66031
AB  - In multicellular organisms, sexual reproduction requires the separation of the
      germline from the soma. In flowering plants, the female germline precursor
      differentiates as a single spore mother cell (SMC) as the ovule primordium forms.
      Here, we explored how organ growth contributes to SMC differentiation. We
      generated 92 annotated 3D images at cellular resolution in Arabidopsis. We
      identified the spatio-temporal pattern of cell division that acts in a
      domain-specific manner as the primordium forms. Tissue growth models uncovered
      plausible morphogenetic principles involving a spatially confined growth signal, 
      differential mechanical properties, and cell growth anisotropy. Our analysis
      revealed that SMC characteristics first arise in more than one cell but SMC fate 
      becomes progressively restricted to a single cell during organ growth. Altered
      primordium geometry coincided with a delay in the fate restriction process in
      katanin mutants. Altogether, our study suggests that tissue geometry channels
      reproductive cell fate in the Arabidopsis ovule primordium.

TI  - A diacylglycerol photoswitching protocol for studying TRPC channel functions in
      mammalian cells and tissue slices.
LID - 100527
AB  - Small molecular probes designed for photopharmacology and opto-chemogenetics are 
      rapidly gaining widespread recognition for investigations of transient receptor
      potential canonical (TRPC) channels. This protocol describes the use of three
      photoswitchable diacylglycerol analogs—PhoDAG-1, PhoDAG-3, and OptoDArG—for
      ultrarapid activation and deactivation of native TRPC2 channels in mouse
      vomeronasal sensory neurons and olfactory type B cells, as well as heterologously
      expressed human TRPC6 channels. Photoconversion can be achieved in mammalian
      tissue slices and enables all-optical stimulation and shutoff of TRPC
      channels.For complete details on the use and execution of this protocol, please
      refer to Leinders-Zufall et al. (2018).

TI  - Brain endothelial tricellular junctions as novel sites for T cell diapedesis
      across the blood–brain barrier.
LID - jcs253880
AB  - The migration of activated T cells across the blood–brain barrier (BBB) is a
      critical step in central nervous system (CNS) immune surveillance and
      inflammation. Whereas T cell diapedesis across the intact BBB seems to occur
      preferentially through the BBB cellular junctions, impaired BBB integrity during 
      neuroinflammation is accompanied by increased transcellular T cell diapedesis.
      The underlying mechanisms directing T cells to paracellular versus transcellular 
      sites of diapedesis across the BBB remain to be explored. By combining in vitro
      live-cell imaging of T cell migration across primary mouse brain microvascular
      endothelial cells (pMBMECs) under physiological flow with serial block-face
      scanning electron microscopy (SBF-SEM), we have identified BBB tricellular
      junctions as novel sites for T cell diapedesis across the BBB. Downregulated
      expression of tricellular junctional proteins or protein-based targeting of their
      interactions in pMBMEC monolayers correlated with enhanced transcellular T cell
      diapedesis, and abluminal presence of chemokines increased T cell diapedesis
      through tricellular junctions. Our observations assign an entirely novel role to 
      BBB tricellular junctions in regulating T cell entry into the CNS.This article
      has an associated First Person interview with the first author of the paper.

      poor prognosis and low survival rates for patients with advanced disease. The
      recurrence rate for advanced laryngeal cancer is between 25 and 50%. In order to 
      improve surgical resection of laryngeal cancer and reduce local recurrence rates,
      various intraoperative optical imaging techniques have been investigated. In this
      systematic review we identify these technologies, evaluating the current state
      and future directions of optical imaging for this indication. Evidently, the
      investigated imaging modalities are generally unsuitable for deep margin
      assessment, and, therefore, inadequate to guide resection in advanced laryngeal
      disease. We discuss two optical imaging techniques that can overcome these
      limitations and suggest how they can be used to achieve adequate margins in
      laryngeal cancer at all stages. Abstract: Laryngeal cancer is a prevalent head
      and neck malignancy, with poor prognosis and low survival rates for patients with
      advanced disease. Treatment consists of unimodal therapy through surgery or
      radiotherapy in early staged tumors, while advanced stage tumors are generally
      treated with multimodal chemoradiotherapy or (total) laryngectomy followed by
      radiotherapy. Still, the recurrence rate for advanced laryngeal cancer is between
      25 and 50%. In order to improve surgical resection of laryngeal cancer and reduce
      local recurrence rates, various intraoperative optical imaging techniques have
      been investigated. In this systematic review, we identify these technologies,
      evaluating the current state and future directions of optical imaging for this
      indication. Narrow-band imaging (NBI) and autofluorescence (AF) are established
      tools for early detection of laryngeal cancer. Nonetheless, their intraoperative 
      utility is limited by an intrinsic inability to image beyond the (sub-)mucosa.
      Likewise, contact endoscopy (CE) and optical coherence tomography (OCT) are
      technically cumbersome and only useful for mucosal margin assessment. Research on
      fluorescence imaging (FLI) for this application is sparse, dealing solely with
      nonspecific fluorescent agents. Evidently, the imaging modalities that have been 
      investigated thus far are generally unsuitable for deep margin assessment. We
      discuss two optical imaging techniques that can overcome these limitations and
      suggest how they can be used to achieve adequate margins in laryngeal cancer at
      all stages.

TI  - A Pixel Design of a Branching Ultra-Highspeed Image Sensor.
LID - 2506
AB  - A burst image sensor named Hanabi, meaning fireworks in Japanese, includes a
      branching CCD and multiple CMOS readout circuits. The sensor is
      backside-illuminated with a light/charge guide pipe to minimize the temporal
      resolution by suppressing the horizontal motion of signal carriers. On the front 
      side, the pixel has a guide gate at the center, branching to six first-branching 
      gates, each bifurcating to second-branching gates, and finally connected to 12
      (=6×2) floating diffusions. The signals are either read out after an image
      capture operation to replay 12 to 48 consecutive images, or continuously
      transferred to a memory chip stacked on the front side of the sensor chip and
      converted to digital signals. A CCD burst image sensor enables a noiseless signal
      transfer from a photodiode to the in-situ storage even at very high frame rates. 
      However, the pixel count conflicts with the frame count due to the large pixel
      size for the relatively large in-pixel CCD memory elements. A CMOS burst image
      sensor can use small trench-type capacitors for memory elements, instead of CCD
      channels. However, the transfer noise from a floating diffusion to the memory
      element increases in proportion to the square root of the frame rate. The Hanabi 
      chip overcomes the compromise between these pros and cons.

      in 3D time lapse images.
LID - e59187
AB  - Despite recent improvements in microscope technologies, segmenting and tracking
      cells in three-dimensional time-lapse images (3D + T images) to extract their
      dynamic positions and activities remains a considerable bottleneck in the field. 
      We developed a deep learning-based software pipeline, 3DeeCellTracker, by
      integrating multiple existing and new techniques including deep learning for
      tracking. With only one volume of training data, one initial correction, and a
      few parameter changes, 3DeeCellTracker successfully segmented and tracked ~100
      cells in both semi-immobilized and ‘straightened’ freely moving worm's brain, in 
      a naturally beating zebrafish heart, and ~1000 cells in a 3D cultured tumor
      spheroid. While these datasets were imaged with highly divergent optical systems,
      our method tracked 90–100% of the cells in most cases, which is comparable or
      superior to previous results. These results suggest that 3DeeCellTracker could
      pave the way for revealing dynamic cell activities in image datasets that have
      been difficult to analyze.

TI  - Rated-M for mesocosm: allowing the multimodal analysis of mature root systems in 
      3D.
PG  - 249-60
AB  - A plants’ water and nutrients are primarily absorbed through roots, which in a
      natural setting is highly dependent on the 3-dimensional configuration of the
      root system, collectively known as root system architecture (RSA). RSA is
      difficult to study due to a variety of factors, accordingly, an arsenal of
      methods have been developed to address the challenges of both growing root
      systems for imaging, and the imaging methods themselves, although there is no
      ‘best’ method as each has its own spectrum of trade-offs. Here, we describe
      several methods for plant growth or imaging. Then, we introduce the adaptation
      and integration of three complementary methods, root mesocosms, photogrammetry,
      and electrical resistance tomography (ERT). Mesocosms can allow for unconstrained
      root growth, excavation and preservation of 3-dimensional RSA, and modularity
      that facilitates the use of a variety of sensors. The recovered root system can
      be digitally reconstructed through photogrammetry, which is an inexpensive method
      requiring only an appropriate studio space and a digital camera. Lastly, we
      demonstrate how 3-dimensional water availability can be measured using ERT inside
      of root mesocosms.

TI  - Early stage dental caries detection using near infrared spatial frequency domain 
      imaging.
LID - 2433
AB  - Early stage dental caries can be remineralized without the need for
      “drill-and-fill” treatments that are more invasive and less permanent. However,
      early stage caries lesions typically present as a white spot on a white
      background, resulting in many lesions only being identified after they have
      developed beyond the point of remineralization as cavities. We present a spatial 
      frequency domain imaging technique to characterize the optical properties of
      dental tissue. This technique enables different dental tissue types (healthy
      enamel, healthy dentin and damaged or demineralized enamel) to be easily
      distinguished from one another and allows quantification of the reduced
      scattering coefficients of dental tissue. The use of near-infrared light at 850
      nm allows high depth penetration into the tissue and suppression of absorption
      effects, ensuring only changes in the reduced scattering coefficient that result 
      directly from demineralization of enamel are observed and simplifying the
      analysis method. This technique provides a tool to both guide the attention of
      dentists to areas of interest and potential demineralization, and to provide
      longitudinal quantified assessments to monitor caries lesion behaviour over time.

      fluorescence and lipophilic dyes.
PG  - 72-80
AB  - Five established clearing protocols were compared with a modified and simplified 
      method to determine an optimal clearing reagent for three-dimensionally
      visualizing fluorophores in the murine liver, a challenging organ to clear. We
      report successful clearing of whole liver lobes by modification of an established
      protocol (UbasM) using only Ub-1, a urea-based amino sugar reagent, in a simpler 
      protocol that requires only a 24-h processing time. With Ub-1 alone, we observed 
      sufficiently preserved liver tissue structure in three dimensions along with
      excellent preservation of fluorophore emissions from endogenous protein reporters
      and lipophilic tracer dyes. This streamlined technique can be used for 3D cell
      lineage tracing and fluoroprobe-based reporter gene expression to compare various
      experimental conditions.

TI  - Translation and Replication Dynamics of Single RNA Viruses.
PG  - 1930-1945.e23
AB  - RNA viruses are among the most prevalent pathogens and are a major burden on
      society. Although RNA viruses have been studied extensively, little is known
      about the processes that occur during the first several hours of infection
      because of a lack of sensitive assays. Here we develop a single-molecule imaging 
      assay, virus infection real-time imaging (VIRIM), to study translation and
      replication of individual RNA viruses in live cells. VIRIM uncovered a striking
      heterogeneity in replication dynamics between cells and revealed extensive
      coordination between translation and replication of single viral RNAs.
      Furthermore, using VIRIM, we identify the replication step of the incoming viral 
      RNA as a major bottleneck of successful infection and identify host genes that
      are responsible for inhibition of early virus replication. Single-molecule
      imaging of virus infection is a powerful tool to study virus replication and
      virus-host interactions that may be broadly applicable to RNA viruses.

TI  - Nano-Engineered Disruption of Heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) Targets Drug-Induced 
      Resistance and Relieves Natural Killer Cell Suppression in Breast Cancer.
PG  - 5355-66
AB  - Drug-induced resistance, or tolerance, is an emerging yet poorly understood
      failure of anticancer therapy. The interplay between drug-tolerant cancer cells
      and innate immunity within the tumor, the consequence on tumor growth, and
      therapeutic strategies to address these challenges remain undescribed. Here we
      elucidate the role of taxane-induced resistance on natural killer (NK) cell tumor
      immunity in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) and the design of
      spatio-temporally controlled nanomedicines, which boost therapeutic efficacy and 
      invigorate ‘disabled’ NK. Drug tolerance limited NK cell immune surveillance via 
      drug-induced depletion of the NK-activating ligand receptor axis, natural killer 
      group 2 member D (NKG2D) and MHC class I polypeptide-related sequence A, B
      (MICA/B). Systems biology supported by empirical evidence revealed the heat shock
      protein 90 (Hsp90) simultaneously controls immune surveillance and persistence of
      drug-treated tumor cells. Based on this evidence, we engineered a ‘chimeric’
      nano-therapeutic tool comprising taxanes and a cholesterol-tethered Hsp90
      inhibitor, radicicol, which targets the tumor, reduces tolerance, and optimally
      re-primes NK cells via prolonged induction of NK-activating ligand receptors via 
      temporal control of drug release in vitro and in vivo. A human ex vivo TNBC model
      confirmed the importance of NK cells in drug-induced death under pressure of
      clinically-approved agents. These findings highlight a convergence between
      drug-induced resistance, the tumor-immune contexture, and engineered approaches
      that considers the tumor and microenvironment to improve the success of
      combinatorial therapy.

TI  - Circadian actions of orexins on the retinorecipient lateral geniculate complex in
      rat.
PG  - 231-52
AB  - Key points: Rhythmic processes in living organisms are controlled by biological
      clocks. The orexinergic system of the lateral hypothalamus carries circadian
      information to provide arousal for the brain during the active phase.Here, we
      show that orexins exert an excitatory action in three parts of the lateral
      geniculate nucleus (LGN), in particular upon directly retinorecipient neurons in 
      the non‐image forming visual structures.We provide evidence for the high
      nocturnal levels of orexins with stable circadian expression of predominant
      orexin receptor 2 in the LGN.Our data additionally establish the convergence of
      orexinergic and pituitary adenylate cyclase (PAC)‐activating peptide/PAC1
      receptor systems (used by melanopsin‐expressing retinal ganglion cells), which
      directly regulates responses to the retinal input.These results help us better
      understand circadian orexinergic control over the non‐image forming subcortical
      visual system, forming the animal's preparedness for the behaviourally active
      night. Abstract: The orexinergic system of the lateral hypothalamus is tightly
      interlinked with the master circadian clock and displays daily variation in
      activity to provide arousal‐related excitation for the plethora of brain
      structures in a circadian manner. Here, using a combination of
      electrophysiological, optogenetic, histological, molecular and neuronal tracing
      methods, we explore a particular link between orexinergic and visual systems in
      rat. The results of the present study demonstrate that orexinergic fibre density 
      at the area of subcortical visual system exerts a clear day to night variability,
      reaching a maximum at behaviourally active night. We also show pronounced
      electrophysiological activations of neurons in the lateral geniculate nucleus by 
      orexin A through 24 h, via identified distinct orexin receptors, with the
      ventrolateral geniculate displaying a daily cycle of responsiveness. In addition,
      for the first time, we provide a direct evidence for orexins to act on
      retinorecipient neurons with a high convergence of orexinergic and putatively
      retinal pituitary adenylate cyclase (PAC)‐activating peptide/PAC1 receptor
      systems. Altogether, the present study ties orexins to non‐image forming visual
      structures with implications for circadian orexinergic modulation of neurons,
      which process information on ambient light levels.

      compartments.
LID - e57297
AB  - Blood development in multicellular organisms relies on specific tissue
      microenvironments that nurture hematopoietic precursors and promote their
      self-renewal, proliferation, and differentiation. The mechanisms driving blood
      cell homing and their interactions with hematopoietic microenvironments remain
      poorly understood. Here, we use the Drosophila melanogaster model to reveal a
      pivotal role for basement membrane composition in the formation of hematopoietic 
      compartments. We demonstrate that by modulating extracellular matrix components, 
      the fly blood cells known as hemocytes can be relocated to tissue surfaces where 
      they function similarly to their natural hematopoietic environment. We establish 
      that the Collagen XV/XVIII ortholog Multiplexin in the tissue-basement membranes 
      and the phagocytosis receptor Eater on the hemocytes physically interact and are 
      necessary and sufficient to induce immune cell-tissue association. These results 
      highlight the cooperation of Multiplexin and Eater as an integral part of a
      homing mechanism that specifies and maintains hematopoietic sites in Drosophila.

TI  - Clinical evolution, management and outcomes of patients with COVID-19 admitted at
      Tygerberg Hospital, Cape Town, South Africa: a research protocol.
LID - e039455
AB  - Introduction: The outbreak of the SARS-CoV-2 virus causing COVID-19, declared a
      global pandemic by the WHO, is a novel infection with a high rate of morbidity
      and mortality. In South Africa, 55 421 cases have been confirmed as of 10 June
      2020, with most cases in the Western Cape Province. Coronavirus leaves us in a
      position of uncertainty regarding the best clinical approach to successfully
      manage the expected high number of severely ill patients with COVID-19. This
      presents a unique opportunity to gather data to inform best practices in clinical
      approach and public health interventions to control COVID-19 locally.
      Furthermore, this pandemic challenges our resolve due to the high burden of HIV
      and tuberculosis (TB) in our country as data are scarce. This study endeavours to
      determine the clinical presentation, severity and prognosis of patients with
      COVID-19 admitted to our hospital. Methods and analysis: The study will use
      multiple approaches taking into account the evolving nature of the COVID-19
      pandemic. Prospective observational design to describe specific patterns of risk 
      predictors of poor outcomes among patients with severe COVID-19 admitted to
      Tygerberg Hospital. Data will be collected from medical records of patients with 
      severe COVID-19 admitted at Tygerberg Hospital. Using the Cox proportional
      hazards model, we will investigate the association between the survival time of
      patients with COVID-19 in relation to one or more of the predictor variables
      including HIV and TB. Ethics and dissemination: The research team obtained
      ethical approval from the Health Research Ethics Committee of the Faculty of
      Medicine and Health Sciences, Stellenbosch University and Research Committee of
      the Tygerberg Hospital. All procedures for the ethical conduct of scientific
      investigation will be adhered to by the research team. The findings will be
      disseminated in clinical seminars, scientific forums and conferences targeting
      clinical care providers and policy-makers.

TI  - Cryo‐FIB preparation of whole cells and tissue for cryo‐TEM: use of high‐pressure
      frozen specimens in tubes and planchets.
PG  - 125-37
AB  - The desire to study macromolecular complexes within their cellular context
      requires the ability to produce thin samples suitable for cryo‐TEM
      (cryo‐transmission electron microscope) investigations. In this paper, we discuss
      two similar approaches, which were developed independently in Utrecht (the
      Netherlands) and Albany (USA). The methods are particularly suitable for both
      tissue samples and cell suspensions prepared by a high‐pressure freezer (HPF).
      The workflows are explained with particular attention to potential pitfalls,
      while underlying principles are highlighted (‘why to do so’). Although both
      workflows function with a high success rate, full execution requires considerable
      experience and remains demanding. In addition, throughput is low. We hope to
      encourage other research groups worldwide to take on the challenge of improving
      the HPF– cryo‐FIB‐SEM – cryo‐TEM workflow. We discuss a number of suggestions to 
      this end. Lay Description: Life is ultimately dictated by the interaction of
      molecules in our bodies. Highly complex equipment is being used and further
      developed to study these interactions. The present paper describes methods to
      prepare small, very thin lamellae (area of 5×5 µm2, thickness 50–300 nm) of a
      cell to be studied in a cryo‐transmission electron microscope (cryo‐TEM). Special
      care must be taken to preserve the natural state of molecules in their natural
      environment. In the case of cryo‐TEM, the samples must be frozen and kept frozen 
      to be compatible with the vacuum conditions in the microscope. The frozen
      condition imposes technical challenges which are addressed. Two approaches to
      obtain the thin lamellae are described. Both make use of a focused ion beam (FIB)
      microscope. The FIB allows removal of material with nanometre precision by
      focusing a beam of ionised atoms (gallium ions) onto the sample. Careful control 
      of the FIB allows cutting out of the required thin lamellae. In both strategies, 
      the thin lamellae remain attached to the original sample, and the ensemble of
      sample with section and sample holder is transported from the FIB microscope to
      the TEM while being kept frozen.

TI  - Antibody tests for identification of current and past infection with SARS‐CoV‐2.
LID - CD013652
AB  - Background: The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2)
      virus and resulting COVID‐19 pandemic present important diagnostic challenges.
      Several diagnostic strategies are available to identify current infection, rule
      out infection, identify people in need of care escalation, or to test for past
      infection and immune response. Serology tests to detect the presence of
      antibodies to SARS‐CoV‐2 aim to identify previous SARS‐CoV‐2 infection, and may
      help to confirm the presence of current infection. Objectives: To assess the
      diagnostic accuracy of antibody tests to determine if a person presenting in the 
      community or in primary or secondary care has SARS‐CoV‐2 infection, or has
      previously had SARS‐CoV‐2 infection, and the accuracy of antibody tests for use
      in seroprevalence surveys. Search methods: We undertook electronic searches in
      the Cochrane COVID‐19 Study Register and the COVID‐19 Living Evidence Database
      from the University of Bern, which is updated daily with published articles from 
      PubMed and Embase and with preprints from medRxiv and bioRxiv. In addition, we
      checked repositories of COVID‐19 publications. We did not apply any language
      restrictions. We conducted searches for this review iteration up to 27 April
      2020. Selection criteria: We included test accuracy studies of any design that
      evaluated antibody tests (including enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assays,
      chemiluminescence immunoassays, and lateral flow assays) in people suspected of
      current or previous SARS‐CoV‐2 infection, or where tests were used to screen for 
      infection. We also included studies of people either known to have, or not to
      have SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. We included all reference standards to define the
      presence or absence of SARS‐CoV‐2 (including reverse transcription polymerase
      chain reaction tests (RT‐PCR) and clinical diagnostic criteria). Data collection 
      and analysis: We assessed possible bias and applicability of the studies using
      the QUADAS‐2 tool. We extracted 2x2 contingency table data and present
      sensitivity and specificity for each antibody (or combination of antibodies)
      using paired forest plots. We pooled data using random‐effects logistic
      regression where appropriate, stratifying by time since post‐symptom onset. We
      tabulated available data by test manufacturer. We have presented uncertainty in
      estimates of sensitivity and specificity using 95% confidence intervals (CIs).
      Main results: We included 57 publications reporting on a total of 54 study
      cohorts with 15,976 samples, of which 8526 were from cases of SARS‐CoV‐2
      infection. Studies were conducted in Asia (n = 38), Europe (n = 15), and the USA 
      and China (n = 1). We identified data from 25 commercial tests and numerous
      in‐house assays, a small fraction of the 279 antibody assays listed by the
      Foundation for Innovative Diagnostics. More than half (n = 28) of the studies
      included were only available as preprints.We had concerns about risk of bias and 
      applicability. Common issues were use of multi‐group designs (n = 29), inclusion 
      of only COVID‐19 cases (n = 19), lack of blinding of the index test (n = 49) and 
      reference standard (n = 29), differential verification (n = 22), and the lack of 
      clarity about participant numbers, characteristics and study exclusions (n = 47).
      Most studies (n = 44) only included people hospitalised due to suspected or
      confirmed COVID‐19 infection. There were no studies exclusively in asymptomatic
      participants. Two‐thirds of the studies (n = 33) defined COVID‐19 cases based on 
      RT‐PCR results alone, ignoring the potential for false‐negative RT‐PCR results.
      We observed evidence of selective publication of study findings through omission 
      of the identity of tests (n = 5).We observed substantial heterogeneity in
      sensitivities of IgA, IgM and IgG antibodies, or combinations thereof, for
      results aggregated across different time periods post‐symptom onset (range 0% to 
      100% for all target antibodies). We thus based the main results of the review on 
      the 38 studies that stratified results by time since symptom onset. The numbers
      of individuals contributing data within each study each week are small and are
      usually not based on tracking the same groups of patients over time.Pooled
      results for IgG, IgM, IgA, total antibodies and IgG/IgM all showed low
      sensitivity during the first week since onset of symptoms (all less than 30.1%), 
      rising in the second week and reaching their highest values in the third week.
      The combination of IgG/IgM had a sensitivity of 30.1% (95% CI 21.4 to 40.7) for 1
      to 7 days, 72.2% (95% CI 63.5 to 79.5) for 8 to 14 days, 91.4% (95% CI 87.0 to
      94.4) for 15 to 21 days. Estimates of accuracy beyond three weeks are based on
      smaller sample sizes and fewer studies. For 21 to 35 days, pooled sensitivities
      for IgG/IgM were 96.0% (95% CI 90.6 to 98.3). There are insufficient studies to
      estimate sensitivity of tests beyond 35 days post‐symptom onset. Summary
      specificities (provided in 35 studies) exceeded 98% for all target antibodies
      with confidence intervals no more than 2 percentage points wide. False‐positive
      results were more common where COVID‐19 had been suspected and ruled out, but
      numbers were small and the difference was within the range expected by
      chance.Assuming a prevalence of 50%, a value considered possible in healthcare
      workers who have suffered respiratory symptoms, we would anticipate that 43 (28
      to 65) would be missed and 7 (3 to 14) would be falsely positive in 1000 people
      undergoing IgG/IgM testing at days 15 to 21 post‐symptom onset. At a prevalence
      of 20%, a likely value in surveys in high‐risk settings, 17 (11 to 26) would be
      missed per 1000 people tested and 10 (5 to 22) would be falsely positive. At a
      lower prevalence of 5%, a likely value in national surveys, 4 (3 to 7) would be
      missed per 1000 tested, and 12 (6 to 27) would be falsely positive.Analyses
      showed small differences in sensitivity between assay type, but methodological
      concerns and sparse data prevent comparisons between test brands. Authors'
      conclusions: The sensitivity of antibody tests is too low in the first week since
      symptom onset to have a primary role for the diagnosis of COVID‐19, but they may 
      still have a role complementing other testing in individuals presenting later,
      when RT‐PCR tests are negative, or are not done. Antibody tests are likely to
      have a useful role for detecting previous SARS‐CoV‐2 infection if used 15 or more
      days after the onset of symptoms. However, the duration of antibody rises is
      currently unknown, and we found very little data beyond 35 days post‐symptom
      onset. We are therefore uncertain about the utility of these tests for
      seroprevalence surveys for public health management purposes. Concerns about high
      risk of bias and applicability make it likely that the accuracy of tests when
      used in clinical care will be lower than reported in the included studies.
      Sensitivity has mainly been evaluated in hospitalised patients, so it is unclear 
      whether the tests are able to detect lower antibody levels likely seen with
      milder and asymptomatic COVID‐19 disease.The design, execution and reporting of
      studies of the accuracy of COVID‐19 tests requires considerable improvement.
      Studies must report data on sensitivity disaggregated by time since onset of
      symptoms. COVID‐19‐positive cases who are RT‐PCR‐negative should be included as
      well as those confirmed RT‐PCR, in accordance with the World Health Organization 
      (WHO) and China National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China
      (CDC) case definitions. We were only able to obtain data from a small proportion 
      of available tests, and action is needed to ensure that all results of test
      evaluations are available in the public domain to prevent selective reporting.
      This is a fast‐moving field and we plan ongoing updates of this living systematic
      review.

AB  - Quantitative microscopy is becoming increasingly crucial in efforts to
      disentangle the complexity of organogenesis, yet adoption of the potent new
      toolbox provided by modern data science has been slow, primarily because it is
      often not directly applicable to developmental imaging data. We tackle this issue
      with a newly developed algorithm that uses point cloud-based morphometry to
      unpack the rich information encoded in 3D image data into a straightforward
      numerical representation. This enabled us to employ data science tools, including
      machine learning, to analyze and integrate cell morphology, intracellular
      organization, gene expression and annotated contextual knowledge. We apply these 
      techniques to construct and explore a quantitative atlas of cellular architecture
      for the zebrafish posterior lateral line primordium, an experimentally tractable 
      model of complex self-organized organogenesis. In doing so, we are able to
      retrieve both previously established and novel biologically relevant patterns,
      demonstrating the potential of our data-driven approach.

TI  - Temporomandibular joint function, periodontal health, and oral microbiome in
      early rheumatoid arthritis and at-risk individuals: a prospective cohort study
      protocol.
LID - 7
AB  - Objectives/aims: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune disease affecting the
      joints, including the temporomandibular joint (TMJ). Early diagnosis and
      treatment can alleviate symptoms and prevent progression. Predictors for disease 
      outcome in individuals at risk for RA are therefore valuable. While limited
      information is available on the prevalence of TMJ involvement in early RA,
      previous studies suggest that RA, periodontitis and the oral microbiome are
      interrelated. Predictive factors for RA development may thus be present in the
      oral cavity. Our two aims are: (1) to assess the prevalence of TMJ involvement in
      early RA, and (2) to investigate the predictive value of oral factors in RA
      development. Materials and methods: We will include 150 individuals in this
      multi-center, prospective cohort study: 50 patients with early RA, 50 at-risk
      individuals, and 50 healthy controls. At baseline, the TMJ, periodontal health,
      and the oral microbiome will be examined. The general health will be followed
      over time, on four occasions up to 3 years. Discussion: Our results will provide 
      insight into the prevalence and clinical characterization of TMJ involvement in
      early RA. For at-risk individuals, oral factors can be studied as possible
      predictors for the development of RA.

TI  - Measurement in opaque flows: a review of measurement techniques for dispersed
      multiphase flows.
PG  - 2089-111
AB  - A review is presented of measurement techniques to characterise dispersed
      multiphase flows, which are not accessible by means of conventional optical
      techniques. The main issues that limit the accuracy and effectiveness of optical 
      techniques are briefly discussed: cross-talk, a reduced signal-to-noise ratio,
      and (biased) data drop-out. Extensions to the standard optical techniques include
      the use of fluorescent tracers, refractive index matching, ballistic imaging,
      structured illumination, and optical coherence tomography. As the first
      non-optical technique, a brief discussion of electrical capacitance tomography is
      given. While truly non-invasive, it suffers from a low resolving power.
      Ultrasound-based techniques have rapidly evolved from Doppler-based profiling to 
      recent 2D approaches using feature tracking. The latter is also suitable for
      time-resolved flow studies. Magnetic resonance velocimetry can provide
      time-averaged velocity fields in 3D for the continuous phase. Finally, X-ray
      imaging is demonstrated to be an important tool to quantify local gas fractions. 
      While potentially very powerful, the impact of the techniques will depend on the 
      development of acquisition and measurement protocols for fluid mechanics, rather 
      than for clinical imaging. This requires systematic development, aided by careful
      validation experiments. As theoretical predictions for multiphase flows are
      sparse, it is important to formulate standardised ‘benchmark’ flows to enable
      this validation.

TI  - Application of Mass Spectrometry Imaging for Visualizing Food Components.
LID - 575
AB  - Consuming food is essential for survival, maintaining health, and triggering
      positive emotions like pleasure. One of the factors that drive us toward such
      behavior is the presence of various compounds in foods. There are many methods to
      analyze these molecules in foods; however, it is difficult to analyze the spatial
      distribution of these compounds using conventional techniques, such as mass
      spectrometry combined with high-performance liquid chromatography or gas
      chromatography. Mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) is a two-dimensional ionization
      technology that enables detection of compounds in tissue sections without
      extraction, purification, separation, or labeling. There are many methods for
      ionization of analytes, including secondary ion mass spectrometry,
      matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization, and desorption electrospray
      ionization. Such MSI technologies can provide spatial information on the location
      of a specific analyte in food. The number of studies utilizing MSI technologies
      in food science has been increasing in the past decade. This review provides an
      overview of some of the recent applications of MSI in food science and related
      fields. In the future, MSI will become one of the most promising technologies for
      visualizing the distribution of food components and for identifying food-related 
      factors by their molecular weights to improve quality, quality assurance, food
      safety, nutritional analysis, and to locate administered food factors.

TI  - Expansion microscopy of C. elegans.
LID - e46249
AB  - We recently developed expansion microscopy (ExM), which achieves
      nanoscale-precise imaging of specimens at ~70 nm resolution (with ~4.5x linear
      expansion) by isotropic swelling of chemically processed, hydrogel-embedded
      tissue. ExM of C. elegans is challenged by its cuticle, which is stiff and
      impermeable to antibodies. Here we present a strategy, expansion of C. elegans
      (ExCel), to expand fixed, intact C. elegans. ExCel enables simultaneous readout
      of fluorescent proteins, RNA, DNA location, and anatomical structures at
      resolutions of ~65–75 nm (3.3–3.8x linear expansion). We also developed
      epitope-preserving ExCel, which enables imaging of endogenous proteins stained by
      antibodies, and iterative ExCel, which enables imaging of fluorescent proteins
      after 20x linear expansion. We demonstrate the utility of the ExCel toolbox for
      mapping synaptic proteins, for identifying previously unreported proteins at cell
      junctions, and for gene expression analysis in multiple individual neurons of the
      same animal.

TI  - Multicolor spectral photon counting CT monitors and quantifies therapeutic cells 
      and their encapsulating scaffold in a model of brain damage.
PG  - 129-41
AB  - Rationale & aim: Various types of cell therapies are currently under
      investigation for the treatment of ischemic stroke patients. To bridge the gap
      between cell administration and therapeutic outcome, there is a need for
      non-invasive monitoring of these innovative therapeutic approaches. Spectral
      photon counting computed tomography (SPCCT) is a new imaging modality that may be
      suitable for cell tracking. SPCCT is the next generation of clinical CT that
      allows the selective visualization and quantification of multiple contrast
      agents. The aims of this study are: (i) to demonstrate the feasibility of using
      SPCCT to longitudinally monitor and quantify therapeutic cells, i.e. bone
      marrow-derived M2-polarized macrophages transplanted in rats with brain damage;
      and (ii) to evaluate the potential of this approach to discriminate M2-polarized 
      macrophages from their encapsulating scaffold.Methods: Twenty one rats received
      an intralesional transplantation of bone marrow-derived M2-polarized macrophages.
      In the first set of experiments, cells were labeled with gold nanoparticles and
      tracked for up to two weeks post-injection in a monocolor study via gold K-edge
      imaging. In the second set of experiments, the same protocol was repeated for a
      bicolor study, in which the labeled cells are embedded in iodine
      nanoparticle-labeled scaffold. The amount of gold in the brain was longitudinally
      quantified using gold K-edge images reconstructed from SPCCT acquisition. Animals
      were sacrificed at different time points post-injection, and ICP-OES was used to 
      validate the accuracy of gold quantification from SPCCT imaging.Results: The
      feasibility of therapeutic cell tracking was successfully demonstrated in
      brain-damaged rats with SPCCT imaging. The imaging modality enabled cell
      monitoring for up to 2 weeks post-injection, in a specific and quantitative
      manner. Differentiation of labeled cells and their embedding scaffold was also
      feasible with SPCCT imaging, with a detection limit as low as 5,000 cells in a
      voxel of 250 × 250 × 250 µm in dimension in vivo.Conclusion: Multicolor SPCCT is 
      an innovative translational imaging tool that allows monitoring and
      quantification of therapeutic cells and their encapsulating scaffold transplanted
      in the damaged rat brain.

TI  - Engineering bio-mimicking functional vesicles with multiple compartments for
      quantifying molecular transport†.
PG  - 4669-79
AB  - Controlled design of giant unilamellar vesicles under defined conditions has vast
      applications in the field of membrane and synthetic biology. Here, we
      bio-engineer bacterial-membrane mimicking models of controlled size under defined
      salt conditions over a range of pH. A complex bacterial lipid extract is used for
      construction of physiologically relevant Gram-negative membrane mimicking
      vesicles whereas a ternary mixture of charged lipids (DOPG, cardiolipin and
      lysyl-PG) is used for building Gram-positive bacterial-membrane vesicles.
      Furthermore, we construct stable multi-compartment biomimicking vesicles using
      the gel-assisted swelling method. Importantly, we validate the bio-application of
      the bacterial vesicle models by quantifying diffusion of chemically synthetic
      amphoteric antibiotics. The transport rate is pH-responsive and depends on the
      lipid composition, based on which a permeation model is proposed. The
      permeability properties of antimicrobial peptides reveal pH dependent
      pore-forming activity in the model vesicles. Finally, we demonstrate the
      functionality of the vesicles by quantifying the uptake of membrane-impermeable
      molecules facilitated by embedded pore-forming proteins. We suggest that the
      bacterial vesicle models developed here can be used to understand fundamental
      biological processes like the peptide assembly mechanism or bacterial cell
      division and will have a multitude of applications in the bottom-up assembly of a
      protocell.

TI  - Microscopic Techniques for the Analysis of Micro and Nanostructures of
      Biopolymers and Their Derivatives.
LID - 512
AB  - Natural biopolymers, a class of materials extracted from renewable sources, is
      garnering interest due to growing concerns over environmental safety; biopolymers
      have the advantage of biocompatibility and biodegradability, an imperative
      requirement. The synthesis of nanoparticles and nanofibers from biopolymers
      provides a green platform relative to the conventional methods that use hazardous
      chemicals. However, it is challenging to characterize these nanoparticles and
      fibers due to the variation in size, shape, and morphology. In order to evaluate 
      these properties, microscopic techniques such as optical microscopy, atomic force
      microscopy (AFM), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) are essential. With 
      the advent of new biopolymer systems, it is necessary to obtain insights into the
      fundamental structures of these systems to determine their structural, physical, 
      and morphological properties, which play a vital role in defining their
      performance and applications. Microscopic techniques perform a decisive role in
      revealing intricate details, which assists in the appraisal of microstructure,
      surface morphology, chemical composition, and interfacial properties. This review
      highlights the significance of various microscopic techniques incorporating the
      literature details that help characterize biopolymers and their derivatives.

LID - e50340
AB  - Cortical circuits can flexibly change with experience and learning, but the
      effects on specific cell types, including distinct inhibitory types, are not well
      understood. Here we investigated how excitatory and VIP inhibitory cells in layer
      2/3 of mouse visual cortex were impacted by visual experience in the context of a
      behavioral task. Mice learned a visual change detection task with a set of eight 
      natural scene images. Subsequently, during 2-photon imaging experiments, mice
      performed the task with these familiar images and three sets of novel images.
      Strikingly, the temporal dynamics of VIP activity differed markedly between novel
      and familiar images: VIP cells were stimulus-driven by novel images but were
      suppressed by familiar stimuli and showed ramping activity when expected stimuli 
      were omitted from a temporally predictable sequence. This prominent change in VIP
      activity suggests that these cells may adopt different modes of processing under 
      novel versus familiar conditions.

TI  - Heating quinoa shoots results in yield loss by inhibiting fruit production and
      delaying maturity.
PG  - 1058-73
AB  - Increasing global temperatures and a growing world population create the need to 
      develop crop varieties that provide higher yields in warmer climates. There is
      growing interest in expanding quinoa cultivation, because of the ability of
      quinoa to produce nutritious grain in poor soils, with little water and at high
      salinity. The main limitation to expanding quinoa cultivation, however, is the
      susceptibility of quinoa to temperatures above approximately 32°C. This study
      investigates the phenotypes, genes and mechanisms that may affect quinoa seed
      yield at high temperatures. Using a differential heating system where only roots 
      or only shoots were heated, quinoa yield losses were attributed to shoot heating.
      Plants with heated shoots lost 60–85% yield as compared with control plants.
      Yield losses were the result of lower fruit production, which lowered the number 
      of seeds produced per plant. Furthermore, plants with heated shoots had delayed
      maturity and greater non‐reproductive shoot biomass, whereas plants with both
      heated roots and heated shoots produced higher yields from the panicles that had 
      escaped the heat, compared with the control. This suggests that quinoa uses a
      type of avoidance strategy to survive heat. Gene expression analysis identified
      transcription factors differentially expressed in plants with heated shoots and
      low yield that had been previously associated with flower development and flower 
      opening. Interestingly, in plants with heated shoots, flowers stayed closed
      during the day while the control flowers were open. Although a closed flower may 
      protect the floral structures, this could also cause yield losses by limiting
      pollen dispersal, which is necessary to produce fruit in the mostly female
      flowers of quinoa.

TI  - Choosing The Right Animal Model for Renal Cancer Research☆.
LID - 100745
AB  - The increase in the life expectancy of patients with renal cell carcinoma (RCC)
      in the last decade is due to changes that have occurred in the area of
      preclinical studies. Understanding cancer pathophysiology and the emergence of
      new therapeutic options, including immunotherapy, would not be possible without
      proper research. Before new approaches to disease treatment are developed and
      introduced into clinical practice they must be preceded by preclinical tests, in 
      which animal studies play a significant role. This review describes the progress 
      in animal model development in kidney cancer research starting from the oldest
      syngeneic or chemically-induced models, through genetically modified mice,
      finally to xenograft, especially patient-derived, avatar and humanized mouse
      models. As there are a number of subtypes of RCC, our aim is to help to choose
      the right animal model for a particular kidney cancer subtype. The data on
      genetic backgrounds, biochemical parameters, histology, different stages of
      carcinogenesis and metastasis in various animal models of RCC as well as their
      translational relevance are summarized. Moreover, we shed some light on imaging
      methods, which can help define tumor microstructure, assist in the analysis of
      its metabolic changes and track metastasis development.

TI  - Masking Phosphate with Rare-Earth Elements Enables Selective Detection of
      Arsenate by Dipycolylamine-ZnII Chemosensor.
LID - 2656
AB  - Functional reassessment of the phosphate-specific chemosensors revealed their
      potential as arsenate detectors. A series of dipicolylamine (Dpa)-ZnII
      chemosensors were screened, among which acridine Dpa-ZnII chemosensor showed the 
      highest capability in sensing arsenate. The presence of excess ZnII improved
      sensitivity and strengthened the binding between acridine Dpa-ZnII complex to
      arsenate as well as phosphate. However, due to their response to phosphate, these
      sensors are not suited for arsenate detection when phosphate is also present.
      This study demonstrated for the first time that rare-earth elements could
      effectively mask phosphate, allowing the specific fluorescence detection of
      arsenate in phosphate-arsenate coexisting systems. In addition, detection of
      arsenate contamination in the real river water samples and soil samples was
      performed to prove its practical use. This sensor was further employed for the
      visualization of arsenate and phosphate uptake in vegetables and flowering plants
      for the first time, as well as in the evaluation of a potent inhibitor of
      arsenate/phosphate uptake.

TI  - In cellulo crystallization of Trypanosoma brucei IMP dehydrogenase enables the
      identification of genuine co-factors.
LID - 620
AB  - Sleeping sickness is a fatal disease caused by the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma
      brucei (Tb). Inosine-5’-monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH) has been proposed as 
      a potential drug target, since it maintains the balance between guanylate
      deoxynucleotide and ribonucleotide levels that is pivotal for the parasite. Here 
      we report the structure of TbIMPDH at room temperature utilizing free-electron
      laser radiation on crystals grown in living insect cells. The 2.80 Å resolution
      structure reveals the presence of ATP and GMP at the canonical sites of the
      Bateman domains, the latter in a so far unknown coordination mode. Consistent
      with previously reported IMPDH complexes harboring guanosine nucleotides at the
      second canonical site, TbIMPDH forms a compact oligomer structure, supporting a
      nucleotide-controlled conformational switch that allosterically modulates the
      catalytic activity. The oligomeric TbIMPDH structure we present here reveals the 
      potential of in cellulo crystallization to identify genuine allosteric co-factors
      from a natural reservoir of specific compounds.

AB  - Many fundamental calcium-dependent physiological processes are triggered by high 
      local calcium levels that are established around the sites of calcium entry into 
      the cell (channels). They are dubbed as calcium nanodomains but their exact
      profiles are still elusive. The concept of calcium nanodomains stems from a
      linear model of calcium diffusion and is only valid when calcium increases are
      smaller than the concentration of cytoplasmic buffers. Recent data indicates that
      much higher calcium levels cause buffer saturation. Therefore, I sought explicit 
      solutions of a nonlinear reaction-diffusion model and found a dichotomous
      solution. For small fluxes, the steady state calcium profile is
      quasi-exponential, and when calcium exceeds buffer concentration a spatial
      periodicity appears. Analytical results are supported by Monte-Carlo simulations.
      I also imaged 1D- and radial calcium distributions around single α-synuclein
      channels in cell-free conditions. Measured Ca profiles are consistent with
      theoretical predictions. I propose that the periodic calcium patterns may well
      arise under certain conditions and their specific functional role has to be
      established.

TI  - Membrane Tension Orchestrates Rear Retraction in Matrix-Directed Cell Migration.
PG  - 460-475.e10
AB  - In development, wound healing, and cancer metastasis, vertebrate cells move
      through 3D interstitial matrix, responding to chemical and physical guidance
      cues. Protrusion at the cell front has been extensively studied, but the
      retraction phase of the migration cycle is not well understood. Here, we show
      that fast-moving cells guided by matrix cues establish positive feedback control 
      of rear retraction by sensing membrane tension. We reveal a mechanism of rear
      retraction in 3D matrix and durotaxis controlled by caveolae, which form in
      response to low membrane tension at the cell rear. Caveolae activate
      RhoA-ROCK1/PKN2 signaling via the RhoA guanidine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF)
      Ect2 to control local F-actin organization and contractility in this subcellular 
      region and promote translocation of the cell rear. A positive feedback loop
      between cytoskeletal signaling and membrane tension leads to rapid retraction to 
      complete the migration cycle in fast-moving cells, providing directional memory
      to drive persistent cell migration in complex matrices.

TI  - Ptychographic imaging of NaD1 induced yeast cell death.
PG  - 4964-74
AB  - Characterising and understanding the mechanisms involved in cell death are
      especially important to combating threats to human health, particularly for the
      study of antimicrobial peptides and their effectiveness against pathogenic fungi.
      However, imaging these processes often relies on the use of synthetic molecules
      which bind to specific cellular targets to produce contrast. Here we study yeast 
      cell death, induced by the anti-fungal peptide, NaD1. By treating yeast as a
      model organism we aim to understand anti-fungal cell death processes without
      relying on sample modification. Using a quantitative phase imaging technique,
      ptychography, we were able to produce label free images of yeast cells during
      death and use them to investigate the mode of action of NaD1. Using this
      technique we were able to identify a significant phase shift which provided a
      clear signature of yeast cell death. Additionally, ptychography identifies cell
      death much earlier than a comparative fluorescence study, providing new insights 
      into the cellular changes that occur during cell death. The results indicate
      ptychography has great potential as a means of providing additional information
      about cellular processes which otherwise may be masked by indirect labelling
      approaches.

TI  - Semi-blind sparse affine spectral unmixing of autofluorescence-contaminated
      micrographs.
PG  - 910-7
AB  - Motivation: Spectral unmixing methods attempt to determine the concentrations of 
      different fluorophores present at each pixel location in an image by analyzing a 
      set of measured emission spectra. Unmixing algorithms have shown great promise
      for applications where samples contain many fluorescent labels; however, existing
      methods perform poorly when confronted with autofluorescence-contaminated images.
      Results: We propose an unmixing algorithm designed to separate fluorophores with 
      overlapping emission spectra from contamination by autofluorescence and
      background fluorescence. First, we formally define a generalization of the linear
      mixing model, called the affine mixture model (AMM), that specifically accounts
      for background fluorescence. Second, we use the AMM to derive an affine
      nonnegative matrix factorization method for estimating fluorophore endmember
      spectra from reference images. Lastly, we propose a semi-blind sparse affine
      spectral unmixing (SSASU) algorithm that uses knowledge of the estimated
      endmembers to learn the autofluorescence and background fluorescence spectra on a
      per-image basis. When unmixing real-world spectral images contaminated by
      autofluorescence, SSASU greatly improved proportion indeterminacy as compared to 
      existing methods for a given relative reconstruction error. Availability and
      implementation: The source code used for this paper was written in Julia and is
      available with the test data at https://github.com/brossetti/ssasu.

TI  - Nanodiamonds enable adaptive-optics enhanced, super-resolution, two-photon
      excitation microscopy.
LID - 190589
AB  - Particles of diamond in the 5–100 nm size range, known as nanodiamond (ND), have 
      shown promise as robust fluorophores for optical imaging. We demonstrate here
      that, due to their photostability, they are not only suitable for two-photon
      imaging, but also allow significant resolution enhancement when combined with
      computational super-resolution techniques. We observe a resolution of 42.5 nm
      when processing two-photon images with the Super-Resolution Radial Fluctuations
      algorithm. We show manipulation of the point-spread function of the microscope
      using adaptive optics. This demonstrates how the photostability of ND can also be
      of use when characterizing adaptive optics technologies or testing the resilience
      of super-resolution or aberration correction algorithms.

TI  - DNA skybridge: 3D structure producing a light sheet for high-throughput
      single-molecule imaging.
PG  - e107
AB  - Real-time visualization of single-proteins or -complexes on nucleic acid
      substrates is an essential tool for characterizing nucleic acid binding proteins.
      Here, we present a novel surface-condition independent and high-throughput
      single-molecule optical imaging platform called ‘DNA skybridge’. The DNA
      skybridge is constructed in a 3D structure with 4 μm-high thin quartz barriers in
      a quartz slide. Each DNA end is attached to the top of the adjacent barrier,
      resulting in the extension and immobilization of DNA. In this 3D structure, the
      bottom surface is out-of-focus when the target molecules on the DNA are imaged.
      Moreover, the DNA skybridge itself creates a thin Gaussian light sheet beam
      parallel to the immobilized DNA. This dual property allows for imaging a single
      probe-tagged molecule moving on DNA while effectively suppressing interference
      with the surface and background signals from the surface.

TI  - Neural signatures of sleep in zebrafish.
PG  - 198-204
AB  - Slow-wave sleep and rapid eye movement (or paradoxical) sleep have been found in 
      mammals, birds and lizards, but it is unclear whether these neuronal signatures
      are found in non-amniotic vertebrates. Here we develop non-invasive
      fluorescence-based polysomnography for zebrafish, and show—using unbiased,
      brain-wide activity recording coupled with assessment of eye movement, muscle
      dynamics and heart rate—that there are at least two major sleep signatures in
      zebrafish. These signatures, which we term slow bursting sleep and propagating
      wave sleep, share commonalities with those of slow-wave sleep and paradoxical or 
      rapid eye movement sleep, respectively. Further, we find that
      melanin-concentrating hormone signalling (which is involved in mammalian sleep)
      also regulates propagating wave sleep signatures and the overall amount of sleep 
      in zebrafish, probably via activation of ependymal cells. These observations
      suggest that common neural signatures of sleep may have emerged in the vertebrate
      brain over 450 million years ago.

TI  - Cellular imaging of inherited retinal diseases using adaptive optics.
PG  - 1683-98
AB  - Adaptive optics (AO) is an insightful tool that has been increasingly applied to 
      existing imaging systems for viewing the retina at a cellular level. By
      correcting for individual optical aberrations, AO offers an improvement in
      transverse resolution from 10–15 μm to ~2 μm, enabling assessment of individual
      retinal cell types. One of the settings in which its utility has been recognised 
      is that of the inherited retinal diseases (IRDs), the genetic and clinical
      heterogeneity of which warrants better cellular characterisation. In this review,
      we provide a summary of the basic principles of AO, its integration into multiple
      retinal imaging modalities and its clinical applications, focusing primarily on
      IRDs. Furthermore, we present a comprehensive summary of AO-based cellular
      findings in IRDs according to their associated disease-causing genes.

TI  - Embedded deep learning in ophthalmology: making ophthalmic imaging smarter.
LID - 2515841419827172
AB  - Deep learning has recently gained high interest in ophthalmology due to its
      ability to detect clinically significant features for diagnosis and prognosis.
      Despite these significant advances, little is known about the ability of various 
      deep learning systems to be embedded within ophthalmic imaging devices, allowing 
      automated image acquisition. In this work, we will review the existing and future
      directions for ‘active acquisition’–embedded deep learning, leading to as
      high-quality images with little intervention by the human operator. In clinical
      practice, the improved image quality should translate into more robust deep
      learning–based clinical diagnostics. Embedded deep learning will be enabled by
      the constantly improving hardware performance with low cost. We will briefly
      review possible computation methods in larger clinical systems. Briefly, they can
      be included in a three-layer framework composed of edge, fog, and cloud layers,
      the former being performed at a device level. Improved egde-layer performance via
      ‘active acquisition’ serves as an automatic data curation operator translating to
      better quality data in electronic health records, as well as on the cloud layer, 
      for improved deep learning–based clinical data mining.

TI  - On-demand Labeling of SNAP-tagged Viral Protein for Pulse-Chase Imaging,
      Quench-Pulse-Chase Imaging, and Nanoscopy-based Inspection of Cell Lysates.
LID - e3177
AB  - Advanced labeling technologies allow researchers to study protein turnover inside
      intact cells and to track the labeled protein in downstream applications. In the 
      context of a viral infection, the combination of imaging and fluorescent labeling
      of viral proteins sheds light on their biological activity and interaction with
      the host cell. Initial approaches have fused fluorescent proteins such as green
      fluorescent protein (GFP) to the viral protein-of-interest. In contrast,
      self-labeling enzyme tags such as the commercial SNAP-tag, a modified version of 
      human O6-alkylguanine-DNA-alkyltransferase, covalently link synthetic ligands,
      which users can add on demand. The first two protocols presented here build on
      previously published protocols for fluorescent labeling in pulse-chase and
      quench-pulse-chase experiments; the combination of fluorescent labeling with
      advanced light microscopy visualizes the dynamic turnover of the SNAP-tagged
      viral protein in intact mammalian cells. A third protocol also outlines how to
      inspect cellular lysates microscopically for detergent-resistant assemblies of
      the labeled viral protein. These protocols showcase the flexibility of the
      SNAP-based labeling system for tracking a viral protein-of-interest in live
      cells, intact fixed cells, and cell lysates. Moreover, the protocols employ
      recently developed commercial microscopes (e.g., Airyscan microscopy) that
      balance resolution, speed, phototoxicity, photobleaching, and ease-of-use.

TI  - Visualization of trigeminal ganglion neuronal activities in mice: Intravital
      imaging of trigeminal ganglion.
PG  - e84
AB  - Visualization of dynamic cellular activity has greatly expanded our understanding
      of brain function. Recently, there has been an increasing number of studies
      imaging rodent brain activity in real time. However, traditional in vivo calcium 
      imaging technology has been limited to superficial brain structures. Because the 
      trigeminal ganglion (TG) is located deep within the cranial cavity of mice, few
      studies have been able to access to it. To circumvent the limitation, overlying
      brain tissue must to be removed to expose the TG, so that optical recording can
      access deep brain neural ensembles. This set of protocols describes a procedure
      for conducting non-survival surgery to visualize the TG in mice while mouse is
      alive. Obtaining these large ensembles of direct, real-time readouts of sensory
      neuron signaling with temporal and spatial information across the TG will help to
      define the cellular basis of orofacial somatic sensing and pain perception.

TI  - Peri-arterial specification of vascular mural cells from naïve mesenchyme
      requires Notch signaling.
LID - dev165589
AB  - Mural cells (MCs) are essential for blood vessel stability and function; however,
      the mechanisms that regulate MC development remain incompletely understood, in
      particular those involved in MC specification. Here, we investigated the first
      steps of MC formation in zebrafish using transgenic reporters. Using pdgfrb and
      abcc9 reporters, we show that the onset of expression of abcc9, a pericyte marker
      in adult mice and zebrafish, occurs almost coincidentally with an increment in
      pdgfrb expression in peri-arterial mesenchymal cells, suggesting that these
      transcriptional changes mark the specification of MC lineage cells from naïve
      pdgfrblow mesenchymal cells. The emergence of peri-arterial pdgfrbhigh MCs
      required Notch signaling. We found that pdgfrb-positive cells express notch2 in
      addition to notch3, and although depletion of notch2 or notch3 failed to block MC
      emergence, embryos depleted of both notch2 and notch3 lost mesoderm- as well as
      neural crest-derived pdgfrbhigh MCs. Using reporters that read out Notch
      signaling and Notch2 receptor cleavage, we show that Notch activation in the
      mesenchyme precedes specification into pdgfrbhigh MCs. Taken together, these
      results show that Notch signaling is necessary for peri-arterial MC
      specification.

TI  - Modelling pancreatic β-cell inflammation in zebrafish identifies the natural
      product wedelolactone for human islet protection.
LID - dmm036004
AB  - Islet inflammation and cytokine production are implicated in pancreatic β-cell
      dysfunction and diabetes pathogenesis. However, we lack therapeutics to protect
      the insulin-producing β-cells from inflammatory damage. Closing this clinical gap
      requires the establishment of new disease models of islet inflammation to
      facilitate screening efforts aimed at identifying new protective agents. Here, we
      have developed a genetic model of Interleukin-1β (Il-1β)-driven islet
      inflammation in zebrafish, a vertebrate that allows for non-invasive imaging of
      β-cells and in vivo drug discovery. Live imaging of immune cells and β-cells in
      our model revealed dynamic migration, increased visitation and prolonged
      macrophage retention in the islet, together with robust activation of NF-κB
      signalling in β-cells. We find that Il-1β-mediated inflammation does not cause
      β-cell destruction but, rather, it impairs β-cell function and identity. In vivo,
      β-cells exhibit impaired glucose-stimulated calcium influx and reduced expression
      of genes involved in function and maturity. These defects are accompanied by
      α-cell expansion, glucose intolerance and hyperglycemia following a glucose
      challenge. Notably, we show that a medicinal plant derivative (wedelolactone) is 
      capable of reducing the immune-cell infiltration while also ameliorating the
      hyperglycemic phenotype of our model. Importantly, these anti-diabetic properties
      in zebrafish are predictive of wedelolactone's efficacy in protecting rodent and 
      human islets from cytokine-induced apoptosis. In summary, this new zebrafish
      model of diabetes opens a window to study the interactions between immune and
      β-cells in vivo, while also allowing the identification of therapeutic agents for
      protecting β-cells from inflammation.

TI  - A thermo-sensitive fluorescent agent based method for excitation light leakage
      rejection for fluorescence molecular tomography.
PG  - 035007
AB  - Fluorescence molecular tomography (FMT) is widely used in preclinical oncology
      research. FMT is the only imaging technique able to provide 3D distribution of
      fluorescent probes within thick highly scattering media. However, its integration
      into clinical medicine has been hampered by its low spatial resolution caused by 
      the undetermined and ill-posed nature of its reconstruction algorithm. Another
      major factor degrading the quality of FMT images is the large backscattered
      excitation light component leaking through the rejection filters and coinciding
      with the weak fluorescent signal arising from a low tissue fluorescence
      concentration. In this paper, we present a new method based on the use of a novel
      thermo-sensitive fluorescence probe. In fact, the excitation light leakage is
      accurately estimated from a set of measurements performed at different
      temperatures and then is corrected for in the tomographic data. The obtained
      results show a considerable improvement in both spatial resolution and
      quantitative accuracy of FMT images due to the proper correction of fluorescent
      signals.

TI  - Endocytosis of Activated Muscarinic m2 Receptor (m2R) in Live Mouse Hippocampal
      Neurons Occurs via a Clathrin-Dependent Pathway.
LID - 450
AB  - Our aim was to examine the dynamics of the muscarinic m2 receptor (m2R), a
      G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR), after agonist activation in living hippocampal
      neurons, and especially clathrin dependency endocytosis. We have previously shown
      that the m2R undergoes agonist-induced internalization in vivo. However, the
      nature of the endocytotic pathway used by m2R after activation is still unknown
      in living neurons. Using live cell imaging and quantitative analyses, we have
      monitored the effect of stimulation on the fate of the membrane-bound m2R and on 
      its redistribution in intraneuronal compartments. Shortly (6 min) after
      activation, m2R is internalized into clathrin immunopositive structures.
      Furthermore, after clathrin-dependent endocytosis, m2R associates with early and 
      late endosomes and with subcellular organelles involved in degradation. Together,
      these results provide, for the first time, a description of m2R trafficking in
      living neurons and prove that m2R undergoes clathrin-dependent endocytosis before
      being degraded.

      lesions in urology: a systematic review.
PG  - 1349-67
AB  - Background: Current optical diagnostic techniques for malignancies are limited in
      their diagnostic accuracy and lack the ability to further characterise disease,
      leading to the rapidly increasing development of novel imaging methods within
      urology. This systematic review critically appraises the literature for novel
      imagining modalities, in the detection and staging of urological cancer and
      assesses their effectiveness via their utility and accuracy. Methods: A
      systematic literature search utilising MEDLINE, EMBASE and Cochrane Library
      Database was conducted from 1970 to September 2018 by two independent reviewers. 
      Studies were included if they assessed real-time imaging modalities not already
      approved in guidelines, in vivo and in humans. Outcome measures included
      diagnostic accuracy and utility parameters, including feasibility and cost.
      Results: Of 5475 articles identified from screening, a final 46 were included.
      Imaging modalities for bladder cancer included optical coherence tomography
      (OCT), confocal laser endomicroscopy, autofluorescence and spectroscopic
      techniques. OCT was the most widely investigated, with 12 studies demonstrating
      improvements in overall diagnostic accuracy (sensitivity 74.5–100% and
      specificity 60–98.5%). Upper urinary tract malignancy diagnosis was assessed
      using photodynamic diagnosis (PDD), narrow band imaging, optical coherence
      tomography and confocal laser endomicroscopy. Only PDD demonstrated consistent
      improvements in overall diagnostic accuracy in five trials (sensitivity 94–96%
      and specificity 96.6–100%). Limited evidence for optical coherence tomography in 
      percutaneous renal biopsy was identified, with anecdotal evidence for any
      modality in penile cancer. Conclusions: Evidence supporting the efficacy for
      identified novel imaging modalities remains limited at present. However, OCT for 
      bladder cancer and PDD in upper tract malignancy demonstrate the best potential
      for improvement in overall diagnostic accuracy. OCT may additionally aid
      intraoperative decision making via real-time staging of disease. Both modalities 
      require ongoing investigation through larger, well-conducted clinical trials to
      assess their diagnostic accuracy, use as an intraoperative staging aid and how to
      best utilise them within clinical practice.

TI  - Time-lapse imaging reveals delayed development of embryos carrying unbalanced
      chromosomal translocations.
PG  - 315-24
AB  - Purpose: The purpose of the study was to compare the morphokinetic parameters of 
      embryos carrying balanced chromosomal translocations with those carrying
      unbalanced chromosomal translocations using time-lapse microscopy. Methods: The
      study group included 270 embryos that underwent biopsies on day 3 for
      preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) for chromosomal translocations in our
      unit between 2013 and 2015. All embryos were incubated under time-lapse
      microscopy and evaluated for timing of developmental events up to day 5. The
      timing of these events was compared between balanced and unbalanced embryos,
      potentially viable and nonviable variants, and maternal versus paternal
      inheritance of the translocation. Results: The PGD analysis found that 209 (77%) 
      of the 270 biopsied embryos carried an unbalanced translocation. Embryos carrying
      unbalanced translocations, which are expected to lead to implantation failure or 
      miscarriage, cleaved less synchronously and were delayed in time of cleavage to
      the 4-cell stage (t4) and in time of start of blastulation (tSB) compared with
      balanced embryos (P < 0.05). Furthermore, embryos carrying nonviable
      translocations demonstrated a significant delay at the time of pronuclei fading
      (tPNf) compared with those carrying potentially viable translocations (P < 0.05).
      Embryos whose unbalanced translocations were of maternal origin were
      significantly delayed in most of the morphokinetic parameters (including tPNf,
      t2, t3, t4, t6, t7, t8, cc2, s2, and tSB) compared with embryos carrying balanced
      translocations (P < 0.05). Conclusions: Embryos carrying unbalanced chromosomal
      translocations mainly of maternal origin undergo delayed development and
      asynchronous cleavage that may lead to implantation failure or miscarriage.

AB  - From basic studies in understanding the role of signaling pathways to therapeutic
      applications in engineering new cellular functions, efficient and safe techniques
      to monitor and modulate molecular targets from cells to organs have been
      extensively developed. The developmental advancement of engineering devices such 
      as microscope and ultrasonic transducers allows us to investigate biological
      processes at different scales. Synthetic biology has further emerged recently as 
      a powerful platform for the development of new diagnostic and therapeutic
      molecular tools. The synergetic amalgamation between engineering tools and
      synthetic biology has rapidly become a new front in the field of bioengineering
      and biotechnology. In this review, ultrasound and its generated mechanical
      perturbation are introduced to serve as a non-invasive engineering approach and, 
      integrated with synthetic biology, to remotely control signaling and genetic
      activities for the guidance of cellular functions deep inside tissue with high
      spatiotemporal resolutions. This ultrasound-based approach together with
      synthetic biology has been applied in immunotherapy, neuroscience, and gene
      delivery, paving the way for the development of next-generation therapeutic
      tools.

TI  - Impaired myogenic development, differentiation and function in hESC-derived SMA
      myoblasts and myotubes.
LID - e0205589
AB  - Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a severe genetic disorder that manifests in
      progressive neuromuscular degeneration. SMA originates from loss-of-function
      mutations of the SMN1 (Survival of Motor Neuron 1) gene. Recent evidence has
      implicated peripheral deficits, especially in skeletal muscle, as key
      contributors to disease progression in SMA. In this study we generated myogenic
      cells from two SMA-affected human embryonic stem cell (hESC) lines with deletion 
      of SMN1 bearing two copies of the SMN2 gene and recapitulating the molecular
      phenotype of Type 1 SMA. We characterized myoblasts and myotubes by comparing
      them to two unaffected, control hESC lines and demonstrate that SMA myoblasts and
      myotubes showed altered expression of various myogenic markers, which translated 
      into an impaired in vitro myogenic maturation and development process.
      Additionally, we provide evidence that these SMN1 deficient cells display
      functional deficits in cholinergic calcium signaling response, glycolysis and
      oxidative phosphorylation. Our data describe a novel human myogenic SMA model
      that might be used for interrogating the effect of SMN depletion during skeletal 
      muscle development, and as model to investigate biological mechanisms targeting
      myogenic differentiation, mitochondrial respiration and calcium signaling
      processes in SMA muscle cells.

TI  - UBL3 modification influences protein sorting to small extracellular vesicles.
LID - 3936
AB  - Exosomes, a type of small extracellular vesicles (sEVs), derived from
      multivesicular bodies (MVBs), mediate cell-to-cell communication by transporting 
      proteins, mRNAs, and miRNAs. However, the molecular mechanism by which proteins
      are sorted to sEVs is not fully understood. Here, we report that ubiquitin-like 3
      (UBL3)/membrane-anchored Ub-fold protein (MUB) acts as a posttranslational
      modification (PTM) factor that regulates protein sorting to sEVs. We find that
      UBL3 modification is indispensable for sorting of UBL3 to MVBs and sEVs. We also 
      observe a 60% reduction of total protein levels in sEVs purified from
      Ubl3-knockout mice compared with those from wild-type mice. By performing
      proteomics analysis, we find 1241 UBL3-interacting proteins, including Ras. We
      also show that UBL3 directly modifies Ras and oncogenic RasG12V mutant, and that 
      UBL3 expression enhances sorting of RasG12V to sEVs via UBL3 modification.
      Collectively, these results indicate that PTM by UBL3 influences the sorting of
      proteins to sEVs.

      super-resolution microscopy.
LID - 13604
AB  - Hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA replication occurs in the cytosol of infected cells
      within a specialised membranous compartment. How the viral non-structural (NS)
      proteins are associated and organised within these structures remains poorly
      defined. We employed a super-resolution microscopy approach to visualise NS3 and 
      NS5A in HCV infected cells. Using single molecule localisation microscopy, both
      NS proteins were resolved as clusters of localisations smaller than the
      diffraction-limited volume observed by wide-field. Analysis of the protein
      clusters identified a significant difference in size between the NS proteins. We 
      also observed a reduction in NS5A cluster size following inhibition of RNA
      replication using daclatasvir, a phenotype which was maintained in the presence
      of the Y93H resistance associated substitution and not observed for NS3 clusters.
      These results provide insight into the NS protein organisation within hepatitis C
      virus RNA replication complexes and the mode of action of NS5A inhibitors.

TI  - An LED-based multi-actinic illumination system for the high throughput study of
      photosynthetic light responses.
LID - e5589
AB  - The responses of photosynthetic organisms to light stress are of interest for
      both fundamental and applied research. Functional traits related to the
      photoinhibition, the light-induced loss of photosynthetic efficiency, are
      particularly interesting as this process is a key limiting factor of
      photosynthetic productivity in algae and plants. The quantitative
      characterization of light responses is often time-consuming and calls for
      cost-effective high throughput approaches that enable the fast screening of
      multiple samples. Here we present a novel illumination system based on the
      concept of ‘multi-actinic imaging’ of in vivo chlorophyll fluorescence. The
      system is based on the combination of an array of individually addressable low
      power RGBW LEDs and custom-designed well plates, allowing for the independent
      illumination of 64 samples through the digital manipulation of both exposure
      duration and light intensity. The illumination system is inexpensive and easily
      fabricated, based on open source electronics, off-the-shelf components, and
      3D-printed parts, and is optimized for imaging of chlorophyll fluorescence. The
      high-throughput potential of the system is illustrated by assessing the
      functional diversity in light responses of marine macroalgal species, through the
      fast and simultaneous determination of kinetic parameters characterizing the
      response to light stress of multiple samples. Although the presented illumination
      system was primarily designed for the measurement of phenotypic traits related to
      photosynthetic activity and photoinhibition, it can be potentially used for a
      number of alternative applications, including the measurement of chloroplast
      phototaxis and action spectra, or as the basis for microphotobioreactors.

TI  - Cousins at work: How combining medical with optical imaging enhances in vivo cell
      tracking.
PG  - 40-50
AB  - Microscopy and medical imaging are related in their exploitation of
      electromagnetic waves, but were developed to satisfy differing needs, namely to
      observe small objects or to look inside subjects/objects, respectively. Together,
      these techniques can help elucidate complex biological processes and better
      understand health and disease. A current major challenge is to delineate
      mechanisms governing cell migration and tissue invasion in organismal
      development, the immune system and in human diseases such as cancer where the
      spatiotemporal tracking of small cell numbers in live animal models is extremely 
      challenging.Multi-modal multi-scale in vivo cell tracking integrates medical and 
      optical imaging. Fuelled by basic research in cancer biology and cell-based
      therapeutics, it has been enabled by technological advances providing enhanced
      resolution, sensitivity and multiplexing capabilities. Here, we review which
      imaging modalities have been successfully used for in vivo cell tracking and how 
      this challenging task has benefitted from combining macroscopic with microscopic 
      techniques.

TI  - Plasticity of differentiated cells in wound repair and tumorigenesis, part II:
      skin and intestine.
LID - dmm035071
AB  - Recent studies have identified and begun to characterize the roles of
      regenerative cellular plasticity in many organs. In Part I of our two-part
      Review, we discussed how cells reprogram following injury to the stomach and
      pancreas. We introduced the concept of a conserved cellular program, much like
      those governing division and death, which may allow mature cells to become
      regenerative. This program, paligenosis, is likely necessary to help organs
      repair the numerous injuries they face over the lifetime of an organism; however,
      we also postulated that rounds of paligenosis and redifferentiation may allow
      long-lived cells to accumulate and store oncogenic mutations, and could thereby
      contribute to tumorigenesis. We have termed the model wherein differentiated
      cells can store mutations and then unmask them upon cell cycle re-entry the
      ‘cyclical hit’ model of tumorigenesis. In the present Review (Part II), we
      discuss these concepts, and cell plasticity as a whole, in the skin and
      intestine. Although differentiation and repair are arguably more thoroughly
      studied in skin and intestine than in stomach and pancreas, it is less clear how 
      mature skin and intestinal cells contribute to tumorigenesis. Moreover, we
      conclude our Review by discussing plasticity in all four organs, and look for
      conserved mechanisms and concepts that might help advance our knowledge of tumor 
      formation and advance the development of therapies for treating or preventing
      cancers that might be shared across multiple organs.

TI  - Cell entry of a host-targeting protein of oomycetes requires gp96.
LID - 2347
AB  - The animal-pathogenic oomycete Saprolegnia parasitica causes serious losses in
      aquaculture by infecting and killing freshwater fish. Like plant-pathogenic
      oomycetes, S. parasitica employs similar infection structures and secretes
      effector proteins that translocate into host cells to manipulate the host. Here, 
      we show that the host-targeting protein SpHtp3 enters fish cells in a
      pathogen-independent manner. This uptake process is guided by a gp96-like
      receptor and can be inhibited by supramolecular tweezers. The C-terminus of
      SpHtp3 (containing the amino acid sequence YKARK), and not the N-terminal RxLR
      motif, is responsible for the uptake into host cells. Following translocation,
      SpHtp3 is released from vesicles into the cytoplasm by another host-targeting
      protein where it degrades nucleic acids. The effector translocation mechanism
      described here, is potentially also relevant for other pathogen–host interactions
      as gp96 is found in both animals and plants.

LID - e1800057
AB  - Mixed self-assembly of ligands 1 and 2, PXDA (3), and Pd(NO3)2 afforded metal
      organic polyhedra (MOP 1 – MOP 3) which bear 24 covalently attached CB[7] and
      cyclooctyne moieties. Post assembly modification (PAM) of MOP 3 by covalent
      strain promoted alkyne azide click reaction provided MOP 4R bearing covalently
      attached functionality (PEG, sulfonate, biotin, c-RGD, fluorescein and cyanine). 
      Orthogonal CB[7] guest mediated non-covalent PAM of MOP 4R with Ad-FITC afforded 
      MOP 5RGDAd-FITC and MOP 5biotin0020Ad-FITC. Flow cytometry analysis of the uptake
      of MOP 5RGDAd-FITC toward U87 cells demonstrated improved uptake relative to
      control MOP lacking c-RGD ligands. These results suggest a broad applicability of
      orthogonally functionalizable (covalent and non-covalent) MOPs in targeted drug
      delivery and imaging applications.

AB  - Tremendous progress has been made since Neuron published our primer on genetic
      dissection of neural circuits ten years ago. Since then, cell type-specific
      anatomical, neurophysiological, and perturbation studies have been carried out in
      a multitude of invertebrate and vertebrate organisms, linking neurons and
      circuits to behavioral functions. New methods allow systematic classification of 
      cell types, and provide genetic access to diverse neuronal types for studies of
      connectivity and neural coding during behavior. Here we evaluate key advances
      over the past decade and discuss future directions.

      promising target for new diagnostic and therapeutic approaches. We aimed to
      develop a novel method to non-invasively analyze molecular mechanisms of
      leukocyte migration in pre-clinical models of inflammation in vivo.Methods: We
      used the ER-HoxB8 system to transiently immortalize murine myeloid precursors
      from wildtype and CD18- as well as MRP14-deficient mice. A VLA4α-/- cell line was
      generated by CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing. We analyzed the migration of
      wildtype and knockout leukocytes in vivo by optical and nuclear imaging in mice
      with irritant contact dermatitis, cutaneous granuloma, experimental arthritis and
      myocardial infarction.Results: Transient immortalization, gene editing and in
      vivo imaging can be combined to analyze migratory mechanisms of murine
      leukocytes, even for gene deletions resulting in lethal phenotypes in mice. We
      reliably confirmed known migratory defects of leukocytes deficient for the
      adhesion molecules CD18 or VLA4α. Also, using our new method we identified a new 
      role of the most abundant calcium-binding proteins in phagocytes and major
      alarmins in many inflammatory diseases, MRP8 and MRP14, for transmigration in
      vivo.Conclusion: We provide a combinatorial approach to rapidly characterize
      molecular mechanisms of leukocyte recruitment in vivo, with the potential to aid 
      in identification of diagnostic and therapeutic targets in inflammatory
      pathologies.

TI  - Quantitative methods to investigate the 4D dynamics of heterochromatic repair
      sites in Drosophila cells.
PG  - 359-89
AB  - Heterochromatin is mostly composed of long stretches of repeated DNA sequences
      prone to ectopic recombination during double-strand break (DSB) repair. In
      Drosophila, ‘safe’ homologous recombination (HR) repair of heterochromatic DSBs
      relies on a striking relocalization of repair sites to the nuclear periphery.
      Central to understanding heterochromatin repair is the ability to investigate the
      4D dynamics (movement in space and time) of repair sites. A specific challenge of
      these studies is preventing phototoxicity and photobleaching effects while
      imaging the sample over long periods of time, and with sufficient time points and
      Z-stacks to track repair foci over time. Here we describe an optimized approach
      for high-resolution live imaging of heterochromatic DSBs in Drosophila cells,
      with a specific emphasis on the fluorescent markers and imaging setup used to
      capture the motion of repair foci over long time periods. We detail approaches
      that minimize photobleaching and phototoxicity with a DeltaVision widefield
      deconvolution microscope, and image-processing techniques for signal recovery
      post-imaging using SoftWorX and Imaris software. We present a method to derive
      mean square displacement (MSD) curves revealing some of the biophysical
      properties of the motion. Finally, describe a method in R to identify tracts of
      directed motions in mixed trajectories. These approaches enable a deeper
      understanding of the mechanisms of heterochromatin dynamics and genome stability 
      in the three-dimensional context of the nucleus, and have broad applicability in 
      the field of nuclear dynamics.

TI  - MreB filaments align along greatest principal membrane curvature to orient cell
      wall synthesis.
LID - e32471
AB  - MreB is essential for rod shape in many bacteria. Membrane-associated MreB
      filaments move around the rod circumference, helping to insert cell wall in the
      radial direction to reinforce rod shape. To understand how oriented MreB motion
      arises, we altered the shape of Bacillus subtilis. MreB motion is isotropic in
      round cells, and orientation is restored when rod shape is externally imposed.
      Stationary filaments orient within protoplasts, and purified MreB tubulates
      liposomes in vitro, orienting within tubes. Together, this demonstrates MreB
      orients along the greatest principal membrane curvature, a conclusion supported
      with biophysical modeling. We observed that spherical cells regenerate into rods 
      in a local, self-reinforcing manner: rapidly propagating rods emerge from small
      bulges, exhibiting oriented MreB motion. We propose that the coupling of MreB
      filament alignment to shape-reinforcing peptidoglycan synthesis creates a
      locally-acting, self-organizing mechanism allowing the rapid establishment and
      stable maintenance of emergent rod shape.

PG  - 361-72
AB  - Molecular imaging has become a powerful technique in preclinical and clinical
      research aiming towards the diagnosis of many diseases. In this work, we address 
      the synthetic challenges in achieving lab‐scale, batch‐to‐batch reproducible
      copper‐64‐ and gallium‐68‐radiolabelled metal nanoparticles (MNPs) for cellular
      imaging purposes. Composite NPs incorporating magnetic iron oxide cores with
      luminescent quantum dots were simultaneously encapsulated within a thin silica
      shell, yielding water‐dispersible, biocompatible and luminescent NPs. Scalable
      surface modification protocols to attach the radioisotopes 64Cu (t1/2=12.7 h) and
      68Ga (t1/2=68 min) in high yields are reported, and are compatible with the time 
      frame of radiolabelling. Confocal and fluorescence lifetime imaging studies
      confirm the uptake of the encapsulated imaging agents and their cytoplasmic
      localisation in prostate cancer (PC‐3) cells. Cellular viability assays show that
      the biocompatibility of the system is improved when the fluorophores are
      encapsulated within a silica shell. The functional and biocompatible SiO2 matrix 
      represents an ideal platform for the incorporation of 64Cu and 68Ga radioisotopes
      with high radiolabelling incorporation.

TI  - CD301b/MGL2+ mononuclear phagocytes orchestrate autoimmune cardiac valve
      inflammation and fibrosis.
PG  - 2478-93
AB  - BACKGROUND: Valvular heart disease (VHD) is common and affects the mitral valve
      (MV) most frequently. Despite the prevalence of mitral valve disease (MVD), the
      cellular and molecular pathways that initiate and perpetuate it are not well
      understood. METHODS: K/B.g7 T cell receptor (TCR) transgenic mice spontaneously
      develop systemic autoantibody-associated autoimmunity, leading to fully-penetrant
      fibro-inflammatory MVD and arthritis. We used multiparameter flow cytometry,
      intracellular cytokine staining, and immunofluorescent staining to characterize
      the cells in inflamed K/B.g7 MVs. We used genetic approaches to study the
      contribution of mononuclear phagocytes (MNPs) to MVD in this model. Specifically,
      we generated K/B.g7 mice in which either CX3CR1 or CD301b/MGL2-expressing MNPs
      were ablated. Using K/B.g7 mice expressing Cx3Cr1-Cre, we conditionally deleted
      critical inflammatory molecules from MNPs, including the Fc receptor
      signal-transducing tyrosine kinase Syk and the cell adhesion molecule very late
      antigen-4 (VLA-4). We performed complementary studies using monoclonal antibodies
      to block key inflammatory molecules. We generated bone marrow chimeric mice to
      define the origin of the inflammatory cells present in the MV and to determine
      which valve cells respond to the pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF. Finally, we
      examined specimens from patients with rheumatic heart disease (RHD) to correlate 
      our findings to human pathology. RESULTS: MNPs comprised the vast majority of
      MV-infiltrating cells; these MNPs expressed CX3CR1 and CD301b/MGL2. Analogous
      cells were present in human RHD valves. K/B.g7 mice lacking CX3CR1 or in which
      CD301b/MGL2-expressing MNPs were ablated were protected from MVD. The
      valve-infiltrating CD301b/MGL2+ MNPs expressed tissue-reparative molecules
      including arginase-1 (Arg-1) and resistin-like molecule alpha (RELM-α). These
      MNPs also expressed the pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF and IL-6, and
      antibody-blockade of these cytokines prevented MVD. Deleting Syk from
      CX3CR1-expressing MNPs reduced their TNF and IL-6 production and also prevented
      MVD. TNF acted through TNFR1 expressed on valve-resident cells to increase
      expression of vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1). Conditionally deleting 
      the VCAM-1 ligand VLA-4 from CX3CR1-expressing MNPs prevented MVD. CONCLUSIONS:
      CD301b/MGL2+ MNPs are key drivers of autoimmune MVD in K/B.g7 mice and are also
      present in human RHD. We define key inflammatory molecules that drive MVD in this
      model, including Syk, TNF, IL-6, VLA-4, and VCAM-1.

      neurodegeneration and FUS aggregate formation.
LID - 335
AB  - Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is the most frequent motor neuron disease.
      Cytoplasmic fused in sarcoma (FUS) aggregates are pathological hallmarks of
      FUS-ALS. Proper shuttling between the nucleus and cytoplasm is essential for
      physiological cell function. However, the initial event in the pathophysiology of
      FUS-ALS remains enigmatic. Using human induced pluripotent stem cell
      (hiPSCs)-derived motor neurons (MNs), we show that impairment of poly(ADP-ribose)
      polymerase (PARP)-dependent DNA damage response (DDR) signaling due to mutations 
      in the FUS nuclear localization sequence (NLS) induces additional cytoplasmic FUS
      mislocalization which in turn results in neurodegeneration and FUS aggregate
      formation. Our work suggests that a key pathophysiologic event in ALS is upstream
      of aggregate formation. Targeting DDR signaling could lead to novel therapeutic
      routes for ameliorating ALS.

      key-elements in cryofrozen Friedreich’s ataxia fibroblasts.
LID - e0190495
AB  - Synchrotron radiation based nanoscopic X-ray fluorescence (SR nano-XRF) analysis 
      can visualize trace level elemental distribution in a fully quantitative manner
      within single cells. However, in-air XRF analysis requires chemical fixation
      modifying the cell’s chemical composition. Here, we describe first nanoscopic XRF
      analysis upon cryogenically frozen (-150°C) fibroblasts at the ID16A-NI
      ‘Nano-imaging’ end-station located at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility
      (ESRF) in Grenoble (France). Fibroblast cells were obtained from skin biopsies
      from control and Friedreich’s ataxia (FRDA) patients. FRDA is an autosomal
      recessive disorder with dysregulation of iron metabolism as a key feature. By
      means of the X-ray Fundamental Parameter (FP) method, including absorption
      correction of the ice layer deposited onto the fibroblasts, background-corrected 
      mass fraction elemental maps of P, S, Cl, K, Ca, Fe and Zn of entire cryofrozen
      human fibroblasts were obtained. Despite the presence of diffracting
      microcrystals in the vitreous ice matrix and minor sample radiation damage
      effects, clusters of iron-rich hot-spots with similar mass fractions were found
      in the cytoplasm of both control and FRDA fibroblasts. Interestingly, no
      significant difference in the mean iron concentration was found in the cytoplasm 
      of FRDA fibroblasts, but a significant decrease in zinc concentration. This
      finding might underscore metal dysregulation, beyond iron, in cells derived from 
      FRDA patients. In conclusion, although currently having slightly increased limits
      of detection (LODs) compared to non-cryogenic mode, SR based nanoscopic XRF under
      cryogenic sample conditions largely obliterates the debate on chemical sample
      preservation and provides a unique tool for trace level elemental imaging in
      single cells close to their native state with a superior spatial resolution of 20
      nm.

TI  - Smartphone Spectrometers.
LID - 223
AB  - Smartphones are playing an increasing role in the sciences, owing to the
      ubiquitous proliferation of these devices, their relatively low cost, increasing 
      processing power and their suitability for integrated data acquisition and
      processing in a ‘lab in a phone’ capacity. There is furthermore the potential to 
      deploy these units as nodes within Internet of Things architectures, enabling
      massive networked data capture. Hitherto, considerable attention has been focused
      on imaging applications of these devices. However, within just the last few
      years, another possibility has emerged: to use smartphones as a means of
      capturing spectra, mostly by coupling various classes of fore-optics to these
      units with data capture achieved using the smartphone camera. These highly novel 
      approaches have the potential to become widely adopted across a broad range of
      scientific e.g., biomedical, chemical and agricultural application areas. In this
      review, we detail the exciting recent development of smartphone spectrometer
      hardware, in addition to covering applications to which these units have been
      deployed, hitherto. The paper also points forward to the potentially highly
      influential impacts that such units could have on the sciences in the coming
      decades.

TI  - The synaptic ribbon is critical for sound encoding at high rates and with
      temporal precision.
LID - e29275
AB  - We studied the role of the synaptic ribbon for sound encoding at the synapses
      between inner hair cells (IHCs) and spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs) in mice
      lacking RIBEYE (RBEKO/KO). Electron and immunofluorescence microscopy revealed a 
      lack of synaptic ribbons and an assembly of several small active zones (AZs) at
      each synaptic contact. Spontaneous and sound-evoked firing rates of SGNs and
      their compound action potential were reduced, indicating impaired transmission at
      ribbonless IHC-SGN synapses. The temporal precision of sound encoding was
      impaired and the recovery of SGN-firing from adaptation indicated slowed synaptic
      vesicle (SV) replenishment. Activation of Ca2+-channels was shifted to more
      depolarized potentials and exocytosis was reduced for weak depolarizations.
      Presynaptic Ca2+-signals showed a broader spread, compatible with the altered
      Ca2+-channel clustering observed by super-resolution immunofluorescence
      microscopy. We postulate that RIBEYE disruption is partially compensated by
      multi-AZ organization. The remaining synaptic deficit indicates ribbon function
      in SV-replenishment and Ca2+-channel regulation.

TI  - Dynamic Ca2+ imaging with a simplified lattice light-sheet microscope: A sideways
      view of subcellular Ca2+ puffs.
PG  - 34-44
AB  - We describe the construction of a simplified, inexpensive lattice light-sheet
      microscope, and illustrate its use for imaging subcellular Ca2+ puffs evoked by
      photoreleased i-IP3 in cultured SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells loaded with the Ca2+ 
      probe Cal520. The microscope provides sub-micron spatial resolution and enables
      recording of local Ca2+ transients in single-slice mode with a signal-to-noise
      ratio and temporal resolution (2ms) at least as good as confocal or total
      internal reflection microscopy. Signals arising from openings of individual IP3R 
      channels are clearly resolved, as are stepwise changes in fluorescence reflecting
      openings and closings of individual channels during puffs. Moreover, by stepping 
      the specimen through the light-sheet, the entire volume of a cell can be scanned 
      within a few hundred ms. The ability to directly visualize a sideways (axial)
      section through cells directly reveals that IP3-evoked Ca2+ puffs originate at
      sites in very close (≤ a few hundred nm) to the plasma membrane, suggesting they 
      play a specific role in signaling to the membrane.

LID - e30233
AB  - Transcriptional assays, such as yeast two-hybrid and TANGO, that convert
      transient protein-protein interactions (PPIs) into stable expression of
      transgenes are powerful tools for PPI discovery, screens, and analysis of cell
      populations. However, such assays often have high background and lose information
      about PPI dynamics. We have developed SPARK (Specific Protein Association tool
      giving transcriptional Readout with rapid Kinetics), in which proteolytic release
      of a membrane-tethered transcription factor (TF) requires both a PPI to deliver a
      protease proximal to its cleavage peptide and blue light to uncage the cleavage
      site. SPARK was used to detect 12 different PPIs in mammalian cells, with 5 min
      temporal resolution and signal ratios up to 37. By shifting the light window, we 
      could reconstruct PPI time-courses. Combined with FACS, SPARK enabled 51 fold
      enrichment of PPI-positive over PPI-negative cells. Due to its high specificity
      and sensitivity, SPARK has the potential to advance PPI analysis and discovery.

      a silicon neuroprobe implanted in the mouse neocortex.
LID - 15642
AB  - Silicon neuroprobes hold great potential for studies of large-scale neural
      activity and brain computer interfaces, but data on brain response in chronic
      implants is limited. Here we explored with in vivo cellular imaging the response 
      to multisite silicon probes for neural recordings. We tested a chronic implant
      for mice consisting of a CMOS-compatible silicon probe rigidly implanted in the
      cortex under a cranial imaging window. Multiunit recordings of cortical neurons
      with the implant showed no degradation of electrophysiological signals weeks
      after implantation (mean spike and noise amplitudes of 186 ± 42 µVpp and 16 ± 3.2
      µVrms, respectively, n = 5 mice). Two-photon imaging through the cranial window
      allowed longitudinal monitoring of fluorescently-labeled astrocytes from the
      second week post implantation for 8 weeks (n = 3 mice). The imaging showed a
      local increase in astrocyte-related fluorescence that remained stable from the
      second to the tenth week post implantation. These results demonstrate that, in a 
      standard electrophysiology protocol in mice, rigidly implanted silicon probes can
      provide good short to medium term chronic recording performance with a limited
      astrocyte inflammatory response. The precise factors influencing the response to 
      silicon probe implants remain to be elucidated.

LID - 20170262
AB  - A key feature of optoacoustic imaging is the ability to illuminate tissue at
      multiple wavelengths and therefore record images with a spectral dimension. While
      optoacoustic images at single wavelengths reveal morphological features, in
      analogy to ultrasound imaging or X-ray imaging, spectral imaging concedes sensing
      of intrinsic chromophores and externally administered agents that can reveal
      physiological, cellular and subcellular functions. Nevertheless, identification
      of spectral moieties within images obtained at multiple wavelengths requires
      spectral unmixing techniques, which present a unique mathematical problem given
      the three-dimensional nature of the optoacoustic images. Herein we discuss
      progress with spectral unmixing techniques developed for multispectral
      optoacoustic tomography. We explain how different techniques are required for
      accurate sensing of intrinsic tissue chromophores such as oxygenated and
      deoxygenated haemoglobin versus extrinsically administered photo-absorbing agents
      and nanoparticles. Finally, we review recent developments that allow accurate
      quantification of blood oxygen saturation (sO2) by transforming and solving the
      sO2 estimation problem from the spatial to the spectral domain.This article is
      part of the themed issue ‘Challenges for chemistry in molecular imaging’.

TI  - Biological effects of MRI contrast agents: gadolinium retention, potential
      mechanisms and a role for phosphorus.
LID - 20170180
AB  - No discussion of challenges for chemistry in molecular imaging would be complete 
      without addressing the elephant in the room—which is that the purest of chemical 
      compounds needs to interact with a biological system in a manner that does not
      perturb normal biology while still providing efficacious feedback to assist in
      diagnosis of disease. In the past decade, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) agents
      long considered inert have produced adverse effects in certain patient
      populations under certain treatment regimens. More recently, inert blood pool
      agents have been found to deposit in the brain. Release of free metal is often
      suspected as the culprit but that hypothesis has yet to be validated. In
      addition, even innocuous agents can cause painful side effects during injection
      in some patients. In this brief review, we summarize known biological effects for
      gadolinium- and iron-based MRI contrast agents, and discuss some of the potential
      mechanisms for the observed biological effects, including the potential role of
      phosphorus imbalance, related to kidney disease or cancer, in destabilizing
      gadolinium-based chelates and precipitating free gadolinium.This article is part 
      of the themed issue ‘Challenges for chemistry in molecular imaging’.

TI  - Has molecular imaging delivered to drug development?
LID - 20170112
AB  - Pharmaceutical research and development requires a systematic interrogation of a 
      candidate molecule through clinical studies. To ensure resources are spent on
      only the most promising molecules, early clinical studies must understand
      fundamental attributes of the drug candidate, including exposure at the target
      site, target binding and pharmacological response in disease. Molecular imaging
      has the potential to quantitatively characterize these properties in small,
      efficient clinical studies. Specific benefits of molecular imaging in this
      setting (compared to blood and tissue sampling) include non-invasiveness and the 
      ability to survey the whole body temporally. These methods have been adopted
      primarily for neuroscience drug development, catalysed by the inability to access
      the brain compartment by other means. If we believe molecular imaging is a
      technology platform able to underpin clinical drug development, why is it not
      adopted further to enable earlier decisions? This article considers current drug 
      development needs, progress towards integration of molecular imaging into
      studies, current impediments and proposed models to broaden use and increase
      impact.This article is part of the themed issue ‘Challenges for chemistry in
      molecular imaging’.

TI  - Integrating nanomedicine and imaging.
LID - 20170110
AB  - Biomedical engineering and its associated disciplines play a pivotal role in
      improving our understanding and management of disease. Motivated by past
      accomplishments, such as the clinical implementation of coronary stents,
      pacemakers or recent developments in antibody therapies, disease management now
      enters a new era in which precision imaging and nanotechnology-enabled
      therapeutics are maturing to clinical translation. Preclinical molecular imaging 
      increasingly focuses on specific components of the immune system that drive
      disease progression and complications, allowing the in vivo study of potential
      therapeutic targets. The first multicentre trials highlight the potential of
      clinical multimodality imaging for more efficient drug development. In this
      perspective, the role of integrating engineering, nanotechnology, molecular
      imaging and immunology to yield precision medicine is discussed.This article is
      part of the themed issue ‘Challenges for chemistry in molecular imaging’.

LID - 20170022
AB  - Molecular imaging enables us to non-invasively visualize cellular functions and
      biological processes in living subjects, allowing accurate diagnosis of diseases 
      at early stages. For successful molecular imaging, a suitable contrast agent with
      high sensitivity is required. To date, various nanoparticles have been developed 
      as contrast agents for medical imaging modalities. In comparison with
      conventional probes, nanoparticles offer several advantages, including
      controllable physical properties, facile surface modification and long
      circulation time. In addition, they can be integrated with various combinations
      for multimodal imaging and therapy. In this opinion piece, we highlight recent
      advances and future perspectives of nanomaterials for molecular imaging.This
      article is part of the themed issue ‘Challenges for chemistry in molecular
      imaging’.

TI  - Development of cyanine probes with dinitrobenzene quencher for rapid fluorogenic 
      protein labelling.
LID - 20170018
AB  - A multicolour protein labelling technique using a protein tag and fluorogenic
      probes is a powerful approach for spatio-temporal analyses of proteins in living 
      cells. Since cyanine fluorophores have attractive properties for multicolour
      imaging of proteins, there is a huge demand to develop fluorogenic cyanine probes
      for specific protein labelling in living cells. Herein, we develop fluorogenic
      cyanine probes for labelling a protein tag by using a dinitrobenzene fluorescence
      quencher. The probes enhanced fluorescence intensity upon labelling reactions and
      emitted orange or far-red fluorescence. Intramolecular interactions between the
      cyanine fluorophores and the dinitrobenzene quencher led not only to fluorescence
      quenching of the probes in the free state but also to promotion of labelling
      reactions. Furthermore, the probes successfully imaged cell-surface proteins
      without a washing process. These findings offer valuable information on the
      design of fluorogenic cyanine probes and indicate that the probes are useful as
      novel live-cell imaging tools.This article is part of the themed issue
      ‘Challenges for chemistry in molecular imaging’.

TI  - FRAME: femtosecond videography for atomic and molecular dynamics.
PG  - e17045-
AB  - Many important scientific questions in physics, chemistry and biology require
      effective methodologies to spectroscopically probe ultrafast intra- and
      inter-atomic/molecular dynamics. However, current methods that extend into the
      femtosecond regime are capable of only point measurements or single-snapshot
      visualizations and thus lack the capability to perform ultrafast spectroscopic
      videography of dynamic single events. Here we present a laser-probe-based method 
      that enables two-dimensional videography at ultrafast timescales (femtosecond and
      shorter) of single, non-repetitive events. The method is based on superimposing a
      structural code onto the illumination to encrypt a single event, which is then
      deciphered in a post-processing step. This coding strategy enables laser probing 
      with arbitrary wavelengths/bandwidths to collect signals with indiscriminate
      spectral information, thus allowing for ultrafast videography with full
      spectroscopic capability. To demonstrate the high temporal resolution of our
      method, we present videography of light propagation with record high 200
      femtosecond temporal resolution. The method is widely applicable for studying a
      multitude of dynamical processes in physics, chemistry and biology over a wide
      range of time scales. Because the minimum frame separation (temporal resolution) 
      is dictated by only the laser pulse duration, attosecond-laser technology may
      further increase video rates by several orders of magnitude.

TI  - 131I-Evans blue: evaluation of necrosis targeting property and preliminary
      assessment of the mechanism in animal models.
PG  - 390-400
AB  - Necrosis is a form of cell death, which is related to various serious diseases
      such as cardiovascular disease, cancer, and neurodegeneration. Necrosis-avid
      agents (NAAs) selectively accumulated in the necrotic tissues can be used for
      imaging and/or therapy of related diseases. The aim of this study was to
      preliminarily investigate necrosis avidity of 131I-evans blue (131I-EB) and its
      mechanism. The biodistribution of 131I-EB at 24 h after intravenous
      administration showed that the radioactivity ratio of necrotic to viable tissue
      was 3.41 in the liver and 11.82 in the muscle as determined by γ counting in
      model rats. Autoradiography and histological staining displayed preferential
      uptake of 131I-EB in necrotic tissues. In vitro nuclear extracts from necrotic
      cells exhibited 82.3% of the uptake in nuclei at 15 min, as well as 79.2% of the 
      uptake at 2 h after 131I-EB incubation. The DNA binding study demonstrated that
      evans blue (EB) has strong binding affinity with calf-thymus DNA (CT-DNA)
      (Ksv=5.08×105 L/(mol/L)). Furthermore, the accumulation of 131I-EB in necrotic
      muscle was efficiently blocked by an excess amount of unlabeled EB. In
      conclusion, 131I-EB can not only detect necrosis by binding the DNA released from
      necrotic cells, but also image necrotic tissues generated from the disease
      clinically.

TI  - Gut-like ectodermal tissue in a sea anemone challenges germ layer homology.
PG  - 1535-42
AB  - Cnidarians (e.g. sea anemones, jellyfish), develop from the outer ectodermal, and
      the inner endodermal germ layer, while bilaterians (e.g. vertebrates, flies)
      additionally exhibit mesoderm as intermediate germ layer. Currently, cnidarian
      endoderm (i.e. ‘mesendoderm’) is considered homologous to both bilaterian
      endoderm and mesoderm. Here, we test this hypothesis by studying the fate of germ
      layer, the localisation of gut cell types, and the expression of numerous
      ‘endodermal’ and ‘mesodermal’ transcription factor orthologs in the anthozoan sea
      anemone Nematostella vectensis. Surprisingly, we find that the developing
      pharyngeal ectoderm and its derivatives display a transcription factor expression
      profile (foxA, hhex, islet, soxB1, hlxB9, tbx2/3, nkx6, nkx2.2) and cell type
      combination (exocrine and insulinergic) reminiscent of the developing bilaterian 
      midgut, and in particular vertebrate pancreatic tissue. Endodermal derivatives,
      instead, display cell functions and transcription factor profiles similar to
      bilaterian mesoderm derivatives (e.g. somatic gonad, heart). Thus, our data
      supports an alternative model of germ layer homologies where cnidarian pharyngeal
      ectoderm corresponds to bilaterian endoderm, and the cnidarian endoderm is
      homologous to bilaterian mesoderm.

TI  - Optical improvements in the diagnosis of bladder cancer: implications for
      clinical practice.
PG  - 251-60
AB  - Background: For over 100 years white-light cystoscopy has remained the
      gold-standard technique for the detection of bladder cancer (BCa). Some
      limitations in the detection of flat lesions (CIS), the differentiation between
      inflammation and malignancy, the inaccurate determination of the tumor margin
      status as well as the tumor depth, have led to a variety of technological
      improvements. The aim of this review is to evaluate the impact of these
      improvements in the diagnosis of BCa and their effectiveness in clinical
      practice. Methods: A systematic literature search was conducted according to the 
      PRISMA statement to identify studies reporting on imaging modalities in the
      diagnosis of NMIBC between 2000 and 2017. A two-stage selection process was
      utilized to determine eligible studies. A total of 74 studies were considered for
      final analysis. Results: Optical imaging technologies have emerged as an adjunct 
      to white-light cystoscopy and can be classified according to their scope as
      macroscopic, microscopic and molecular. Macroscopic techniques including
      photodynamic diagnosis (PDD), narrow-band imaging (NBI) and the Storz
      Professional Image Enhancement System (IMAGE1 S, formerly known as SPIES) are
      similar to white-light cystoscopy, but are superior in the detection of bladder
      tumors by means of contrast enhancement. Especially the detection rate of very
      mute lesions in the bladder mucosa (CIS) could be significantly increased by the 
      use of these methods. Microscopic imaging techniques like confocal laser
      endomicroscopy and optical coherence tomography permit a real-time
      high-resolution assessment of the bladder mucosa at a cellular and sub-cellular
      level with spatial resolutions similar to histology, enabling the surgeon to
      perform an ‘optical biopsy’. Molecular techniques are based on the combination of
      optical imaging technologies with fluorescence labeling of cancer-specific
      molecular agents like antibodies. This labeling is intended to favor an optical
      distinction between benign and malignant tissue. Conclusions: Optical
      improvements of the standard white-light cystoscopy have proven their benefit in 
      the detection of BCa and have found their way into clinical practice. Especially 
      the combination of macroscopic and microscopic techniques may improve diagnostic 
      accuracy. Nevertheless, HAL-PDD guided cystoscopy is the only approach approved
      for routine use in the diagnosis of BCa by most urological associations in the EU
      and USA to date.

TI  - Microscope objective based 4π spectroscopic tissue scattering goniometry.
PG  - 3828-41
AB  - The measurement of optical scattering as a function of angle, goniometry, can
      provide a wealth of information about tissue. The goniometry technique described 
      here measures the intensity profile at the pupil planes of two microscope
      objectives with a scattering sample between them. The maximum observable
      scattering angle is extended by employing off-axis illumination. This
      configuration permits several advantages including: i) rapid measurement of
      scattering into 4π sr to characterize the entire scattering phase function in
      isotropic tissue, ii) sensitivity to axially asymmetric scattering from
      anisotropic fibrous tissue, iii) selective interrogation of small regions within 
      spatially inhomogenous tissue, iv) concurrent measurement of scattering
      coefficient μs, and v) measurement of wavelength dependent scattering properties 
      via spectrally tunable source. The instrument is validated by comparing
      measurements of microsphere suspensions to the Mie scattering solution.
      Instrument capabilities are demonstrated with samples of rat brain and mouse eye 
      tissues.

TI  - Current Developments in Mobilization of Hematopoietic Stem and Progenitor Cells
      and Their Interaction with Niches in Bone Marrow.
PG  - 151-64
AB  - The clinical application of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) has
      evolved from a highly experimental stage in the 1980s to a currently clinically
      established treatment for more than 20,000 patients annually who suffer from
      hematological malignancies and other severe diseases. Studies in numerous murine 
      models have demonstrated that HSPCs reside in distinct niches within the bone
      marrow environment. Whereas transplanted HSPCs travel through the bloodstream and
      home to sites of hematopoiesis, HSPCs can be mobilized from these niches into the
      blood either physiologically or induced by pharmaceutical drugs. Firstly, this
      review aims to give a synopsis of milestones defining niches and mobilization
      pathways for HSPCs, including the identification of several cell types involved
      such as osteoblasts, adventitial reticular cells, endothelial cells, monocytic
      cells, and granulocytic cells. The main factors that anchor HSPCs in the niche,
      and/or induce their quiescence are vascular cell adhesion molecule(VCAM)-1, CD44,
      hematopoietic growth factors, e.g. stem cell factor (SCF) and FLT3 Ligand,
      chemokines including CXCL12, growth-regulated protein beta and IL-8, proteases,
      peptides, and other chemical transmitters such as nucleotides. In the second part
      of the review, we revise the current understanding of HSPC mobilization. Here, we
      discuss which mechanisms found to be active in HSPC mobilization correspond to
      the mechanisms relevant for HSPC interaction with niche cells, but also deal with
      other mediators and signals that target individual cell types and receptors to
      mobilize HSPCs. A multitude of questions remain to be addressed for a better
      understanding of HSPC biology and its implications for therapy, including more
      comprehensive concepts for regulatory circuits such as calcium homeostasis and
      parathormone, metabolic regulation such as by leptin, the significance of
      autonomic nervous system, the consequences of alteration of niches in aged
      patients, or the identification of more easily accessible markers to better
      predict the efficiency of HSPC mobilization.

TI  - Wide-field three-photon excitation in biological samples.
PG  - e16255-
AB  - Three-photon wide-field depth-resolved excitation is used to overcome some of the
      limitations in conventional point-scanning two- and three-photon microscopy.
      Excitation of chromophores as diverse as channelrhodopsins and quantum dots is
      shown, and a penetration depth of more than 700 μm into fixed scattering brain
      tissue is achieved, approximately twice as deep as that achieved using two-photon
      wide-field excitation. Compatibility with live animal experiments is confirmed by
      imaging the cerebral vasculature of an anesthetized mouse; a complete focal stack
      was obtained without any evidence of photodamage. As an additional validation of 
      the utility of wide-field three-photon excitation, functional excitation is
      demonstrated by performing three-photon optogenetic stimulation of cultured mouse
      hippocampal neurons expressing a channelrhodopsin; action potentials could
      reliably be excited without causing photodamage.

TI  - Optically and acoustically triggerable sub-micron phase-change contrast agents
      for enhanced photoacoustic and ultrasound imaging.
PG  - 26-36
AB  - We demonstrate a versatile phase-change sub-micron contrast agent providing three
      modes of contrast enhancement: 1) photoacoustic imaging contrast, 2) ultrasound
      contrast with optical activation, and 3) ultrasound contrast with acoustic
      activation. This agent, which we name ‘Cy-droplet’, has the following novel
      features. It comprises a highly volatile perfluorocarbon for easy versatile
      activation, and a near-infrared optically absorbing dye chosen to absorb light at
      a wavelength with good tissue penetration. It is manufactured via a ‘microbubble 
      condensation’ method. The phase-transition of Cy-droplets can be optically
      triggered by pulsed-laser illumination, inducing photoacoustic signal and forming
      stable gas bubbles that are visible with echo-ultrasound in situ. Alternatively, 
      Cy-droplets can be converted to microbubble contrast agents upon acoustic
      activation with clinical ultrasound. Potentially all modes offer extravascular
      contrast enhancement because of the sub-micron initial size. Such versatility of 
      acoustic and optical ‘triggerability’ can potentially improve multi-modality
      imaging, molecularly targeted imaging and controlled drug release.

TI  - Intravital microscopy in historic and contemporary immunology.
PG  - 506-13
AB  - In this review, we discuss intravital microscopy of immune cells, starting from
      its historic origins to current applications in diverse organs. It is clear from 
      a quantitative review of the literature that intravital microscopy is a key tool 
      in both historic and contemporary immunological research, providing unique
      advances in our understanding of immune responses. We have chosen to focus this
      review on how intravital microscopy methodologies are used to image specific
      organs or systems and we present recent descriptions of fundamental immunological
      processes that could not have been achieved by other methods. The following
      target organs / systems are discussed in more detail: cremaster muscle, skin (ear
      and dorsal skin fold chamber), lymph node, liver, lung, mesenteric vessels,
      carotid artery, bone marrow, brain, spleen, foetus and lastly vessels of the
      knee-joint.

TI  - HPV16 and 18 genome amplification show different E4-dependence, with 16E4
      enhancing E1 nuclear accumulation and replicative efficiency via its cell cycle
      arrest and kinase activation functions.
LID - e1006282
AB  - To clarify E1^E4’s role during high-risk HPV infection, the E4 proteins of HPV16 
      and 18 were compared side by side using an isogenic keratinocyte differentiation 
      model. While no effect on cell proliferation or viral genome copy number was
      observed during the early phase of either virus life cycle, time-course
      experiments showed that viral genome amplification and L1 expression were
      differently affected upon differentiation, with HPV16 showing a much clearer E4
      dependency. Although E4 loss never completely abolished genome amplification, its
      more obvious contribution in HPV16 focused our efforts on 16E4. As previously
      suggested, in the context of the virus life cycle, 16E4s G2-arrest capability was
      found to contribute to both genome amplification success and L1 accumulation.
      Loss of 16E4 also lead to a reduced maintenance of ERK, JNK and p38MAPK activity 
      throughout the genome amplifying cell layers, with 16E4 (but not 18E4)
      co-localizing precisely with activated cytoplasmic JNK in both wild type raft
      tissue, and HPV16-induced patient biopsy tissue. When 16E1 was co-expressed with 
      E4, as occurs during genome amplification in vivo, the E1 replication helicase
      accumulated preferentially in the nucleus, and in transient replication assays,
      E4 stimulated viral genome amplification. Interestingly, a 16E1 mutant deficient 
      in its regulatory phosphorylation sites no longer accumulated in the nucleus
      following E4 co-expression. E4-mediated stabilisation of 16E2 was also apparent, 
      with E2 levels declining in organotypic raft culture when 16E4 was absent. These 
      results suggest that 16E4-mediated enhancement of genome amplification involves
      its cell cycle inhibition and cellular kinase activation functions, with E4
      modifying the activity and function of viral replication proteins including E1.
      These activities of 16E4, and the different kinase patterns seen here with HPV18,
      31 and 45, may reflect natural differences in the biology and tropisms of these
      viruses, as well as differences in E4 function.

TI  - A mechanistic study of gold nanoparticle radiosensitisation using targeted
      microbeam irradiation.
LID - 44752
AB  - Gold nanoparticles (GNPs) have been demonstrated as effective radiosensitizing
      agents in a range of preclinical models using broad field sources of various
      energies. This study aimed to distinguish between these mechanisms by applying
      subcellular targeting using a soft X-ray microbeam in combination with GNPs. DNA 
      damage and repair kinetics were determined following nuclear and cytoplasmic
      irradiation using a soft X-ray (carbon K-shell, 278 eV) microbeam in MDA-MB-231
      breast cancer and AG01522 fibroblast cells with and without GNPs. To investigate 
      the mechanism of the GNP induced radiosensitization, GNP-induced mitochondrial
      depolarisation was quantified by TMRE staining, and levels of DNA damage were
      compared in cells with depolarised and functional mitochondria. Differential
      effects were observed following radiation exposure between the two cell lines.
      These findings were validated 24 hours after removal of GNPs by flow cytometry
      analysis of mitochondrial depolarisation. This study provides further evidence
      that GNP radiosensitisation is mediated by mitochondrial function and it is the
      first report applying a soft X-ray microbeam to study the radiobiological effects
      of GNPs to enable the separation of physical and biological effects.

TI  - Fundus autofluorescence imaging: systematic review of test accuracy for the
      diagnosis and monitoring of retinal conditions.
PG  - 995-1007
AB  - We conducted a systematic review of the accuracy of fundus autofluorescence (FAF)
      imaging for diagnosing and monitoring retinal conditions. Searches in November
      2014 identified English language references. Sources included MEDLINE, EMBASE,
      the Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and MEDION databases; reference lists of
      retrieved studies; and internet pages of relevant organisations, meetings, and
      trial registries. For inclusion, studies had to report FAF imaging accuracy
      quantitatively. Studies were critically appraised using QUADAS risk of bias
      criteria. Two reviewers conducted all review steps. From 2240 unique references
      identified, eight primary research studies met the inclusion criteria. These
      investigated diagnostic accuracy of FAF imaging for choroidal neovascularisation 
      (one study), reticular pseudodrusen (three studies), cystoid macular oedema (two 
      studies), and diabetic macular oedema (two studies). Diagnostic sensitivity of
      FAF imaging ranged from 32 to 100% and specificity from 34 to 100%. However,
      owing to methodological limitations, including high and/or unclear risks of bias,
      none of these studies provides conclusive evidence of the diagnostic accuracy of 
      FAF imaging. Study heterogeneity precluded meta-analysis. In most studies, the
      patient spectrum was not reflective of those who would present in clinical
      practice and no studies adequately reported whether FAF images were interpreted
      consistently. No studies of monitoring accuracy were identified. An update in
      October 2016, based on MEDLINE and internet searches, identified four new studies
      but did not alter our conclusions. Robust quantitative evidence on the accuracy
      of FAF imaging and how FAF images are interpreted is lacking. We provide
      recommendations to address this.

PG  - 3-33
AB  - Adaptive optics is a relatively new field, yet it is spreading rapidly and allows
      new questions to be asked about how the visual system is organized. The editors
      of this feature issue have posed a series of question to scientists involved in
      using adaptive optics in vision science. The questions are focused on three main 
      areas. In the first we investigate the use of adaptive optics for psychophysical 
      measurements of visual system function and for improving the optics of the eye.
      In the second, we look at the applications and impact of adaptive optics on
      retinal imaging and its promise for basic and applied research. In the third, we 
      explore how adaptive optics is being used to improve our understanding of the
      neurophysiology of the visual system.

TI  - Positive-feedback, ratiometric biosensor expression improves high-throughput
      metabolite-producer screening efficiency in yeast.
LID - ysw002
AB  - Biosensors are valuable and versatile tools in synthetic biology that are used to
      modulate gene expression in response to a wide range of stimuli. Ligand
      responsive transcription factors are a class of biosensor that can be used to
      couple intracellular metabolite concentration with gene expression to enable
      dynamic regulation and high-throughput metabolite producer screening. We have
      established the Saccharomyces cerevisiae WAR1 transcriptional regulator and PDR12
      promoter as an organic acid biosensor that can be used to detect varying levels
      of para-hydroxybenzoic acid (PHBA) production from the shikimate pathway and
      output green fluorescent protein (GFP) expression in response. The dynamic range 
      of GFP expression in response to PHBA was dramatically increased by engineering
      positive-feedback expression of the WAR1 transcriptional regulator from its
      target PDR12 promoter. In addition, the noise in GFP expression at the
      population-level was controlled by normalising GFP fluorescence to constitutively
      expressed mCherry fluorescence within each cell. These biosensor modifications
      increased the high-throughput screening efficiency of yeast cells engineered to
      produce PHBA by 5,000-fold, enabling accurate fluorescence activated cell sorting
      isolation of producer cells that were mixed at a ratio of 1 in 10,000 with
      non-producers. Positive-feedback, ratiometric transcriptional regulator
      expression is likely applicable to many other transcription-factor/promoter pairs
      used in synthetic biology and metabolic engineering for both dynamic regulation
      and high-throughput screening applications.

TI  - Hierarchical prediction errors in midbrain and septum during social learning.
PG  - 618-34
AB  - Social learning is fundamental to human interactions, yet its computational and
      physiological mechanisms are not well understood. One prominent open question
      concerns the role of neuromodulatory transmitters. We combined fMRI,
      computational modelling and genetics to address this question in two separate
      samples (N = 35, N = 47). Participants played a game requiring inference on an
      adviser’s intentions whose motivation to help or mislead changed over time. Our
      analyses suggest that hierarchically structured belief updates about current
      advice validity and the adviser’s trustworthiness, respectively, depend on
      different neuromodulatory systems. Low-level prediction errors (PEs) about advice
      accuracy not only activated regions known to support ‘theory of mind’, but also
      the dopaminergic midbrain. Furthermore, PE responses in ventral striatum were
      influenced by the Met/Val polymorphism of the Catechol-O-Methyltransferase (COMT)
      gene. By contrast, high-level PEs (‘expected uncertainty’) about the adviser’s
      fidelity activated the cholinergic septum. These findings, replicated in both
      samples, have important implications: They suggest that social learning rests on 
      hierarchically related PEs encoded by midbrain and septum activity, respectively,
      in the same manner as other forms of learning under volatility. Furthermore,
      these hierarchical PEs may be broadcast by dopaminergic and cholinergic
      projections to induce plasticity specifically in cortical areas known to
      represent beliefs about others.

TI  - Intravital characterization of tumor cell migration in pancreatic cancer.
LID - e1261773
AB  - Curing pancreatic cancer is difficult as metastases often determine the poor
      clinical outcome. To gain more insight into the metastatic behavior of pancreatic
      cancer cells, we characterized migratory cells in primary pancreatic tumors using
      intravital microscopy. We visualized the migratory behavior of primary tumor
      cells of a genetically engineered pancreatic cancer mouse model and found that
      pancreatic tumor cells migrate with a mesenchymal morphology as single individual
      cells or collectively as a stream of non-cohesive single motile cells. These
      findings may improve our ability to conceive treatments that block metastatic
      behavior.

TI  - Phase retrieval by coherent modulation imaging.
LID - 13367
AB  - Phase retrieval is a long-standing problem in imaging when only the intensity of 
      the wavefield can be recorded. Coherent diffraction imaging is a lensless
      technique that uses iterative algorithms to recover amplitude and phase contrast 
      images from diffraction intensity data. For general samples, phase retrieval from
      a single-diffraction pattern has been an algorithmic and experimental challenge. 
      Here we report a method of phase retrieval that uses a known modulation of the
      sample exit wave. This coherent modulation imaging method removes inherent
      ambiguities of coherent diffraction imaging and uses a reliable, rapidly
      converging iterative algorithm involving three planes. It works for extended
      samples, does not require tight support for convergence and relaxes dynamic range
      requirements on the detector. Coherent modulation imaging provides a robust
      method for imaging in materials and biological science, while its single-shot
      capability will benefit the investigation of dynamical processes with pulsed
      sources, such as X-ray free-electron lasers.

TI  - Carbon nanotubes allow capture of krypton, barium and lead for multichannel
      biological X-ray fluorescence imaging.
LID - 13118
AB  - The desire to study biology in situ has been aided by many imaging techniques.
      Among these, X-ray fluorescence (XRF) mapping permits observation of elemental
      distributions in a multichannel manner. However, XRF imaging is underused, in
      part, because of the difficulty in interpreting maps without an underlying
      cellular ‘blueprint'; this could be supplied using contrast agents. Carbon
      nanotubes (CNTs) can be filled with a wide range of inorganic materials, and thus
      can be used as ‘contrast agents' if biologically absent elements are
      encapsulated. Here we show that sealed single-walled CNTs filled with lead,
      barium and even krypton can be produced, and externally decorated with peptides
      to provide affinity for sub-cellular targets. The agents are able to highlight
      specific organelles in multiplexed XRF mapping, and are, in principle, a general 
      and versatile tool for this, and other modes of biological imaging.

      (OM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) have been used to observe
      weak-phase objects. However, conventional OM has low spatial resolution and TEM
      is limited to thin specimens. Here, we report on the development of dark-field
      X-ray ptychography, which combines X-ray ptychography and X-ray in-line
      holography, to observe weak-phase objects with a phase resolution better than
      0.01 rad, a spatial resolution better than 15 nm, and a field of view larger than
      5 μm. We apply this method to the observation of both the outline and
      magnetosomes of the magnetotactic bacteria MO-1. Observation of thick samples
      with high resolution is expected to find broad applications in not only biology
      but also materials science.
