TI  - AIF3 splicing switch triggers neurodegeneration.
LID - 25
AB  - Background: Apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF), as a mitochondrial flavoprotein,
      plays a fundamental role in mitochondrial bioenergetics that is critical for cell
      survival and also mediates caspase-independent cell death once it is released
      from mitochondria and translocated to the nucleus under ischemic stroke or
      neurodegenerative diseases. Although alternative splicing regulation of AIF has
      been implicated, it remains unknown which AIF splicing isoform will be induced
      under pathological conditions and how it impacts mitochondrial functions and
      neurodegeneration in adult brain. Methods: AIF splicing induction in brain was
      determined by multiple approaches including 5′ RACE, Sanger sequencing,
      splicing-specific PCR assay and bottom-up proteomic analysis. The role of AIF
      splicing in mitochondria and neurodegeneration was determined by its biochemical 
      properties, cell death analysis, morphological and functional alterations and
      animal behavior. Three animal models, including loss-of-function harlequin model,
      gain-of-function AIF3 knockin model and conditional inducible AIF splicing model 
      established using either Cre-loxp recombination or CRISPR/Cas9 techniques, were
      applied to explore underlying mechanisms of AIF splicing-induced
      neurodegeneration. Results: We identified a nature splicing AIF isoform lacking
      exons 2 and 3 named as AIF3. AIF3 was undetectable under physiological conditions
      but its expression was increased in mouse and human postmortem brain after
      stroke. AIF3 splicing in mouse brain caused enlarged ventricles and severe
      neurodegeneration in the forebrain regions. These AIF3 splicing mice died
      2–4 months after birth. AIF3 splicing-triggered neurodegeneration involves both
      mitochondrial dysfunction and AIF3 nuclear translocation. We showed that AIF3
      inhibited NADH oxidase activity, ATP production, oxygen consumption, and
      mitochondrial biogenesis. In addition, expression of AIF3 significantly increased
      chromatin condensation and nuclear shrinkage leading to neuronal cell death.
      However, loss-of-AIF alone in harlequin or gain-of-AIF3 alone in AIF3 knockin
      mice did not cause robust neurodegeneration as that observed in AIF3 splicing
      mice. Conclusions: We identified AIF3 as a disease-inducible isoform and
      established AIF3 splicing mouse model. The molecular mechanism underlying AIF3
      splicing-induced neurodegeneration involves mitochondrial dysfunction and AIF3
      nuclear translocation resulting from the synergistic effect of loss-of-AIF and
      gain-of-AIF3. Our study provides a valuable tool to understand the role of AIF3
      splicing in brain and a potential therapeutic target to prevent/delay the
      progress of neurodegenerative diseases. Supplementary Information: The online

TI  - T-DM1 versus pertuzumab, trastuzumab and a taxane as first-line therapy of
      early-relapsed HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer: an Italian multicenter
      observational study.
LID - 100099
AB  - Background: The current standard first-line treatment of human epidermal growth
      factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive (+) metastatic breast cancer is the combination
      of pertuzumab, trastuzumab and a taxane (P + T + taxane), while standard
      second-line is ado-trastuzumab-emtansine (T-DM1). The registration trial of
      pertuzumab, however, did not include early-relapsing patients, defined as
      patients experiencing tumor relapse ≤12 months from the end of (neo)adjuvant
      anti-HER2 therapy. Conversely, the pivotal trial of T-DM1 included some patients 
      relapsing ≤6 months after the end of (neo)adjuvant trastuzumab. Thus, a
      proportion of early-relapsing patients are currently eligible to receive T-DM1 as
      first-line treatment. Nevertheless, no direct comparison exists between the two
      regimens in this clinical setting. Patients and methods: We retrospectively
      compared T-DM1 versus P + T + taxane as first-line treatment in two cohorts of
      early-relapsing patients in an Italian ‘real-world’ setting, involving 14 public 
      health care institutions. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival.
      Secondary endpoints included patients' characterization, overall survival and
      post-progression survival. Univariate and multivariate analyses were carried out.
      All tests were two-sided and a P ≤ 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
      Results: Among 1252 screened patients, 75 met the inclusion criteria. Forty-four 
      (58.7%) received P + T + taxane and 31 (41.3%) received T-DM1. The two cohorts
      showed similar characteristics of aggressiveness and no significant differences
      in treatment history. T-DM1, compared with P + T + taxane was associated with
      worse progression-free survival (adjusted hazard ratio: 2.26, 95% confidence
      interval: 1.13-4.52, P = 0.021) and overall survival (adjusted hazard ratio:
      3.95, 95% confidence interval: 1.38-11.32, P = 0.010), irrespective of previous
      (neo)adjuvant treatment, age, hormone receptors status, time-to-relapse (≤6
      months or within 6-12 months) and presence of visceral/brain metastases. No
      differences were observed in post-progression survival (P = 0.095). Conclusions: 
      Our study suggests superiority for P + T + taxane over T-DM1 as up-front
      treatment of early-relapsing HER2+ metastatic breast cancer, which merits further
      assessment in larger and prospective trials.

TI  - Reg4 and its downstream transcriptional activator CD44ICD in stage II and III
      colorectal cancer.
PG  - 278-91
AB  - Reg4 is highly expressed in gastrointestinal malignancies and acts as a mitogenic
      and pro-invasive factor. Our recent works suggest that Reg4 binds with CD44 and
      induces its proteolytic cleavage to release intra-cytoplasmic domain of CD44
      (CD44ICD). The goal of this study is to demonstrate clinical significance of the 
      Reg4-CD44/CD44ICD pathway in stage II/III colon cancer and its association with
      clinical parameters of aggression. We constructed a tissue microarray (TMA) of 93
      stage II/III matched colon adenocarcinoma patients, 23 with recurrent disease.
      The TMA was immunohistochemically stained for Reg4, CD44, and CD44ICD proteins
      and analyzed to identify associations with tumor characteristics, recurrence and 
      overall survival. The TMA data analysis showed a significant correlation between 
      Reg4 and CD44 (r2 = 0.23, P = 0.028), CD44 and CD44ICD (r2 = 0.36, p = 0.0004),
      and Reg4 and CD44ICD (r2 = 0.45, p ≤ 0.0001). Reg4 expression was associated with
      larger tumor size (r2 = 0.23, p = 0.026). Although, no association was observed
      between Reg4, CD44, or CD44ICD expression and disease recurrence, Reg4-positive
      patients had a median survival of 4 years vs. 7 years for Reg4-negative patients 
      (p = 0.04) in patients who recurred. Inhibition of the Reg4-CD44/CD44ICD pathway 
      may be a future therapeutic target for colon cancer patients.

TI  - Global chromatin organizer SATB1 acts as a context-dependent regulator of the
      Wnt/Wg target genes.
LID - 3385
AB  - Special AT-rich binding protein-1 (SATB1) integrates higher-order chromatin
      architecture with gene regulation, thereby regulating multiple signaling
      pathways. In mammalian cells SATB1 directly interacts with β-catenin and
      regulates the expression of Wnt targets by binding to their promoters. Whether
      SATB1 regulates Wnt/wg signaling by recruitment of β-catenin and/or its
      interactions with other components remains elusive. Since Wnt/Wg signaling is
      conserved from invertebrates to humans, we investigated SATB1 functions in
      regulation of Wnt/Wg signaling by using mammalian cell-lines and Drosophila.
      Here, we present evidence that in mammalian cells, SATB1 interacts with
      Dishevelled, an upstream component of the Wnt/Wg pathway. Conversely, ectopic
      expression of full-length human SATB1 but not that of its N- or C-terminal
      domains in the eye imaginal discs and salivary glands of third instar Drosophila 
      larvae increased the expression of Wnt/Wg pathway antagonists and suppressed
      phenotypes associated with activated Wnt/Wg pathway. These data argue that
      ectopically-provided SATB1 presumably modulates Wnt/Wg signaling by acting as
      negative regulator in Drosophila. Interestingly, comparison of SATB1 with PDZ-
      and homeo-domain containing Drosophila protein Defective Proventriculus suggests 
      that both proteins exhibit limited functional similarity in the regulation of
      Wnt/Wg signaling in Drosophila. Collectively, these findings indicate that
      regulation of Wnt/Wg pathway by SATB1 is context-dependent.

TI  - Molecules and Mechanisms to Overcome Oxidative Stress Inducing Cardiovascular
      Disease in Cancer Patients.
LID - 105
AB  - Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are molecules involved in signal transduction
      pathways with both beneficial and detrimental effects on human cells. ROS are
      generated by many cellular processes including mitochondrial respiration,
      metabolism and enzymatic activities. In physiological conditions, ROS levels are 
      well-balanced by antioxidative detoxification systems. In contrast, in
      pathological conditions such as cardiovascular, neurological and cancer diseases,
      ROS production exceeds the antioxidative detoxification capacity of cells,
      leading to cellular damages and death. In this review, we will first describe the
      biology and mechanisms of ROS mediated oxidative stress in cardiovascular
      disease. Second, we will review the role of oxidative stress mediated by
      oncological treatments in inducing cardiovascular disease. Lastly, we will
      discuss the strategies that potentially counteract the oxidative stress in order 
      to fight the onset and progression of cardiovascular disease, including that
      induced by oncological treatments.

TI  - Circular Migration and Precarity: Perspectives from Rural Bihar.
PG  - 1-21
AB  - Migration and mobilities are vastly underestimated in India. In particular,
      circular migration remains poorly captured as circular migrants move back and
      forth between source and destination regions. Based on survey data from rural
      Bihar, an important source region of migration in India, this paper finds that a 
      vast majority of migrants work and live in precarity in predominantly urban and
      prosperous destinations across India. However, those at the lowest rungs of the
      social and economic ladder in source regions—the scheduled castes and scheduled
      tribes, other backward classes I and the labouring class—are the worst off at
      destination; they are part of the most precarious shorter-term migration streams,
      earn the lowest incomes, have the poorest conditions of work, and live in the
      harshest circumstances. The paper shows that social and economic hierarchies, and
      in turn, precarity in source region is reproduced at destination, and, thus,
      there is little evidence that spatial mobility is associated with social
      mobility. Focusing on migrants’ location, work, employment, income, housing, and 
      access to basic services at destination, the paper foregrounds migrant precarity 
      and adds to a small body of empirical literature that is significant in
      understanding the spatial and structural elements of circular migration in India 
      and in turn, the migration crisis that emerged as a result of the economic shock 
      of the COVID 19 pandemic.

TI  - Soybean (Glycine max) Haplotype Map (GmHapMap): a universal resource for soybean 
      translational and functional genomics.
PG  - 324-34
AB  - Here, we describe a worldwide haplotype map for soybean (GmHapMap) constructed
      using whole‐genome sequence data for 1007 Glycine max accessions and yielding
      14.9 million variants as well as 4.3 M tag single‐nucleotide polymorphisms
      (SNPs). When sampling random subsets of these accessions, the number of variants 
      and tag SNPs plateaued beyond approximately 800 and 600 accessions, respectively.
      This suggests extensive coverage of diversity within the cultivated soybean.
      GmHapMap variants were imputed onto 21 618 previously genotyped accessions with
      up to 96% success for common alleles. A local association analysis was performed 
      with the imputed data using markers located in a 1‐Mb region known to contribute 
      to seed oil content and enabled us to identify a candidate causal SNP residing in
      the NPC1 gene. We determined gene‐centric haplotypes (407 867 GCHs) for the
      55 589 genes and showed that such haplotypes can help to identify alleles that
      differ in the resulting phenotype. Finally, we predicted 18 031 putative
      loss‐of‐function (LOF) mutations in 10 662 genes and illustrated how such a
      resource can be used to explore gene function. The GmHapMap provides a unique
      worldwide resource for applied soybean genomics and breeding.

TI  - Dual inhibition of VEGF and PARP suppresses KRAS-mutant colorectal cancer.
PG  - 365-75
AB  - The addition of bevacizumab to chemotherapy has prolonged overall and
      progression-free survival rates for metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). However,
      KRAS-mutant (KRAS-mut) CRC, lacking an ideal targeted agent, represents an
      inferior-response subgroup of patients. In the present study, we investigated a
      combination approach of bevacizumab + olaparib in KRAS-mut CRC in a preclinical
      setting. The combined therapy effectively prevented tumor growth in a KRAS-mut
      cancer cell-derived xenograft model, although this effect was not observed in
      vitro. Under bevacizumab treatment, we detected intratumor hypoxia and impaired
      homologous recombination repair (HRR), accompanied by vascular regression. We
      explored the underlying mechanism of this combined therapy by mimicking a hypoxic
      condition in vitro using cobalt chloride (CoCl2). The results showed that hypoxia
      impairs HRR and therefore sensitized KRAS-mut CRC cell lines HCT-116, SW620, and 
      Lovo to olaparib. Furthermore, under this hypoxic condition, olaparib could
      arrest the cell cycle in the G2/M phase, increase DNA damage and dramatically
      induce cell apoptosis in KRAS-mut CRC cells. Taken together, these results
      indicated that the combination of bevacizumab + olaparib could be a potential
      therapeutic approach in a KRAS-mut CRC cohort.

TI  - Expression and clinical implication of cyclooxygenase-2 and E-cadherin in oral
      squamous cell carcinomas.
PG  - 667-74
AB  - Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT) and angiogenesis are crucial events for
      development of aggressive and often fatal Oral Squamous Cell Carcinomas (OSCCs). 
      Both promote cancer progression and metastasis development, but while the former 
      induces the loss of E-cadherin expression and, hence cadherin switching; the
      latter produces hematic blood vessel neo-formation and contribute to OSCC cell
      growth, tumor mass development, and dissemination. Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) has
      an important role, not only in angiogenic mechanisms, but also in favoring cancer
      invasion. Indeed it decreases the expression of E-cadherin and leads to
      phenotypic changes in epithelial cells (EMT) enhancing their carcinogenic
      potential. Our aim is to evaluate the interplay between E-cadherin cytoplasmic
      delocalization, COX-2 up-regulation and COX-2 induced neo-angiogenesis in 120
      cases of OSCC. We have analyzed the distribution and the number of neo-formed
      endothelial buds surrounding infiltrating cells that express COX-2, as well as
      the neo-formed vessels in chronic inflammatory infiltrate, which surround the
      tumor. A double immunostaining method was employed in order to verify
      co-localization of endothelial cell marker (CD34) and COX-2. IHC has also been
      used to assess E-cadherin expression. Our data demonstrate that the OSCC cells,
      which lose membranous E-cadherin staining, acquiring a cytoplasmic
      delocalization, overexpress COX-2. Moreover, we find a new CD34+ vessel formation
      (sprouting angiogenesis). Only basaloid type of OSCC showes low level of COX-2
      expression together with very low level of neo-angiogenesis and consequent tumor 
      necrosis. The well-known anti-metastatic effect of certain COX-2 inhibitors
      suggests that these molecules might have clinical utility in the management of
      advanced cancers.

TI  - Researching the future of purchasing and supply management: The purpose and
      potential of scenarios.
PG  - 100624
AB  - Drawing on prior research, the value of scenario planning as a methodology for
      researching the future of purchasing and supply management (PSM) is explored.
      Using three criteria of research quality – rigour, originality and significance –
      it is shown how developing scenarios and analysing their implications present
      new, important research opportunities for PSM academics, practitioners, and
      leaders of the profession. Researching the future of PSM supports the
      identification of uncertainties and anticipates change across many units and
      levels of analysis of interest to PSM scholars and practitioners, such as the
      profession/discipline, markets/sectors, or organisations. Scenarios are
      particularly effective for: considering how the complex interaction of
      macro-environmental factors affects the PSM context; avoiding incremental
      thinking; surfacing assumptions and revealing significant blind spots. PSM
      research using scenarios aligns with Corley and Gioia's (2011) call for
      prescience-oriented research in which academics aim for more impactful research, 
      enhancing sense-giving potential and theoretical relevance to practice, to better
      perform their adaptive role in society.

TI  - Horizontal fissuring at the osteochondral interface: a novel and unique
      pathological feature in patients with obesity-related osteoarthritis.
PG  - 811-8
AB  - Objectives: Obesity is a well-recognised risk factor for osteoarthritis (OA). Our
      aim is to characterise body mass index (BMI)-associated pathological changes in
      the osteochondral unit and determine if obesity is the major causal antecedent of
      early joint replacement in patients with OA. Methods: We analysed the correlation
      between BMI and the age at which patients undergo total knee replacement (TKR) in
      41 023 patients from the Australian Orthopaedic Association National Joint
      Replacement Registry. We then investigated the effect of BMI on pathological
      changes of the tibia plateau of knee joint in a representative subset of the
      registry. Results: 57.58% of patients in Australia who had TKR were obese.
      Patients with overweight, obese class I & II or obese class III received a TKR
      1.89, 4.48 and 8.08 years earlier than patients with normal weight, respectively.
      Microscopic examination revealed that horizontal fissuring at the osteochondral
      interface was the major pathological feature of obesity-related OA. The frequency
      of horizontal fissure was strongly associated with increased BMI in the
      predominant compartment. An increase in one unit of BMI (1 kg/m2) increased the
      odds of horizontal fissures by 14.7%. 84.4% of the horizontal fissures were
      attributable to obesity. Reduced cartilage degradation and alteration of
      subchondral bone microstructure were also associated with increased BMI.
      Conclusions: The key pathological feature in OA patients with obesity is
      horizontal fissuring at the osteochondral unit interface. Obesity is strongly
      associated with a younger age of first TKR, which may be a result of horizontal
      fissures.

TI  - Personalized Medicine—Current and Emerging Predictive and Prognostic Biomarkers
      in Colorectal Cancer.
LID - 812
AB  - Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common cancer diagnosed worldwide and
      is heterogeneous both morphologically and molecularly. In an era of personalized 
      medicine, the greatest challenge is to predict individual response to therapy and
      distinguish patients likely to be cured with surgical resection of tumors and
      systemic therapy from those resistant or non-responsive to treatment. Patients
      would avoid futile treatments, including clinical trial regimes and ultimately
      this would prevent under- and over-treatment and reduce unnecessary adverse side 
      effects. In this review, the potential of specific biomarkers will be explored to
      address two key questions—1) Can the prognosis of patients that will fare well or
      poorly be determined beyond currently recognized prognostic indicators? and 2)
      Can an individual patient’s response to therapy be predicted and those who will
      most likely benefit from treatment/s be identified? Identifying and validating
      key prognostic and predictive biomarkers and an understanding of the underlying
      mechanisms of drug resistance and toxicity in CRC are important steps in order to
      personalize treatment. This review addresses recent data on biological prognostic
      and predictive biomarkers in CRC. In addition, patient cohorts most likely to
      benefit from currently available systemic treatments and/or targeted therapies
      are discussed in this review.

TI  - Pentamidine niosomes thwart S100B effects in human colon carcinoma biopsies
      favouring wtp53 rescue.
PG  - 3053-63
AB  - S100B protein bridges chronic mucosal inflammation and colorectal cancer given
      its ability to activate NF‐kappaB transcription via RAGE signalling and
      sequestrate pro‐apoptotic wtp53. Being an S100B inhibitor, pentamidine
      antagonizes S100B‐wtp53 interaction, restoring wtp53‐mediated pro‐apoptotic
      control in cancer cells in several types of tumours. The expression of S100B,
      pro‐inflammatory molecules and wtp53 protein was evaluated in human biopsies
      deriving from controls, ulcerative colitis and colon cancer patients at baseline 
      (a) and (b) following S100B targeting with niosomal PENtamidine VEhiculation
      (PENVE), to maximize drug permeabilization in the tissue. Cultured biopsies
      underwent immunoblot, EMSA, ELISA and biochemical assays for S100B and related
      pro‐inflammatory/pro‐apoptotic proteins. Exogenous S100B (0.005‐5 μmol/L) alone, 
      or in the presence of PENVE (0.005‐5 μmol/L), was tested in control biopsies
      while PENVE (5 μmol/L) was evaluated on control, peritumoral, ulcerative colitis 
      and colon cancer biopsies. Our data show that S100B level progressively increases
      in control, peritumoral, ulcerative colitis and colon cancer enabling a
      pro‐inflammatory/angiogenic and antiapoptotic environment, featured by iNOS, VEGF
      and IL‐6 up‐regulation and wtp53 and Bax inhibition. PENVE inhibited S100B
      activity, reducing its capability to activate RAGE/phosphor‐p38 MAPK/NF‐kappaB
      and favouring its disengagement with wtp53. PENVE blocks S100B activity and
      rescues wtp53 expression determining pro‐apoptotic control in colon cancer,
      suggesting pentamidine as a potential anticancer drug.

TI  - Extracellular Vesicles and Epigenetic Modifications Are Hallmarks of Melanoma
      Progression.
LID - 52
AB  - Cutaneous melanoma shows a high metastatic potential based on its ability to
      overcome the immune system’s control. The mechanisms activated for these
      functions vary extremely and are also represented by the production of a number
      of extracellular vesicles including exosomes. Other vesicles showing a potential 
      role in the melanoma progression include oncosomes and melanosomes and the
      majority of them mediate tumor processes including angiogenesis, immune
      regulation, and modifications of the micro-environment. Moreover, a number of
      epigenetic modifications have been described in melanoma and abundant production 
      of altered microRNAs (mi-RNAs), non-coding RNAs, histones, and abnormal DNA
      methylation have been associated with different phases of melanoma progression.
      In addition, exosomes, miRNAs, and other molecular factors have been used as
      potential biomarkers reflecting disease evolution while others have been
      suggested to be potential druggable molecules for therapeutic application.

TI  - Expression of myeloid Src-family kinases is associated with poor prognosis in AML
      and influences Flt3-ITD kinase inhibitor acquired resistance.
LID - e0225887
AB  - Unregulated protein-tyrosine kinase signaling is a common feature of AML, often
      involving mutations in Flt3 and overexpression of myeloid Src-family kinases
      (Hck, Fgr, Lyn). Here we show that high-level expression of these Src kinases
      predicts poor survival in a large cohort of AML patients. To test the therapeutic
      benefit of Flt3 and Src-family kinase inhibition, we used the pyrrolopyrimidine
      kinase inhibitor A-419259. This compound potently inhibits Hck, Fgr, and Lyn as
      well as Flt3 bearing an activating internal tandem duplication (ITD). Flt3-ITD
      expression sensitized human TF-1 myeloid cells to growth arrest by A-419259,
      supporting direct action on the Flt3-ITD kinase domain. Cells transformed with
      the Flt3-ITD mutants D835Y and F691L were resistant to A-419259, while
      co-expression of Hck or Fgr restored inhibitor sensitivity to Flt3-ITD D835Y.
      Conversely, Hck and Fgr mutants with engineered A-419259 resistance mutations
      decreased sensitivity of TF-1/Flt3-ITD cells. To investigate de novo resistance
      mechanisms, A-419259-resistant Flt3-ITD+ AML cell populations were derived via
      long-term dose escalation. Whole exome sequencing identified a distinct Flt3-ITD 
      kinase domain mutation (N676S/T) among all A-419259 target kinases in each of six
      independent resistant cell populations. These studies show that Hck and Fgr
      expression influences inhibitor sensitivity and the pathway to acquired
      resistance in Flt3-ITD+ AML.

TI  - A single amino acid switch converts the Sleeping Beauty transposase into an
      efficient unidirectional excisionase with utility in stem cell reprogramming.
PG  - 316-31
AB  - The Sleeping Beauty (SB) transposon is an advanced tool for genetic engineering
      and a useful model to investigate cut-and-paste DNA transposition in vertebrate
      cells. Here, we identify novel SB transposase mutants that display efficient and 
      canonical excision but practically unmeasurable genomic re-integration. Based on 
      phylogenetic analyses, we establish compensating amino acid replacements that
      fully rescue the integration defect of these mutants, suggesting epistasis
      between these amino acid residues. We further show that the transposons excised
      by the exc+/int− transposase mutants form extrachromosomal circles that cannot
      undergo a further round of transposition, thereby representing dead-end products 
      of the excision reaction. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of the exc+/int−
      transposase in cassette removal for the generation of reprogramming factor-free
      induced pluripotent stem cells. Lack of genomic integration and formation of
      transposon circles following excision is reminiscent of signal sequence removal
      during V(D)J recombination, and implies that cut-and-paste DNA transposition can 
      be converted to a unidirectional process by a single amino acid change.

TI  - Metabolism of the dual FLT-3/Aurora kinase inhibitor CCT241736 in preclinical and
      human in vitro models: Implication for the choice of toxicology species.
LID - 104899
AB  - CCT241736 is a dual fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3)/Aurora kinase inhibitor in 
      development for the treatment of acute myeloid leukaemia. The successful
      development of any new drug relies on adequate safety testing including
      preclinical toxicology studies. Selection of an appropriate preclinical species
      requires a thorough understanding of the compound's metabolic clearance and
      pathways, as well as other pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic considerations. In
      addition, elucidation of the metabolising enzymes in human facilitates improved
      clinical prediction based on population pharmacokinetics and can inform drug-drug
      interaction studies. Intrinsic clearance (CLint) determination and metabolite
      profiling of CCT241736 in human and four preclinical species (dog, minipig, rat
      and mouse) was undertaken in cryopreserved hepatocytes and liver microsomes.
      Recombinant human cytochrome P450 bactosomes (rCYP) were utilised to provide
      reaction phenotyping data and support prediction of metabolic pathways. CCT241736
      exhibited low CLint in both hepatocytes and liver microsomes of human, dog,
      minipig and rat, but considerably higher CLint in mouse. CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 were
      identified as the major enzymes responsible for biotransformation of CCT241736 in
      human, exclusively forming five out of seven metabolites. Minipig showed greatest
      similarity to human with regard to both overall metabolic profile and abundance
      of specific metabolites relative to parent compound, and is therefore proposed as
      the most appropriate toxicological species. The greatest disparity was observed
      between human and dog. Based on metabolic profile, either mouse or rat is a
      suitable rodent species for toxicology studies.

TI  - On the beneficent thickness of water.
LID - 20190061
AB  - In the 1930s, Lars Onsager published his famous ‘reciprocal relations’ describing
      free energy conversion processes. Importantly, these relations were derived on
      the assumption that the fluxes of the processes involved in the conversion were
      proportional to the forces (free energy gradients) driving them. For chemical
      reactions, however, this condition holds only for systems operating close to
      equilibrium—indeed very close; nominally requiring driving forces to be smaller
      than kBT. Fairly soon thereafter, however, it was quite inexplicably observed
      that in at least some biological conversions both the reciprocal relations and
      linear flux–force dependency appeared to be obeyed no matter how far from
      equilibrium the system was being driven. No successful explanation of how this
      ‘paradoxical’ behaviour could occur has emerged and it has remained a mystery. We
      here argue, however, that this anomalous behaviour is simply a gift of water, of 
      its viscosity in particular; a gift, moreover, without which life almost
      certainly could not have emerged. And a gift whose appreciation we primarily owe 
      to recent work by Prof. R. Dean Astumian who, as providence has kindly seen to
      it, was led to the relevant insights by the later work of Onsager himself.

TI  - Maintenance BEZ235 Treatment Prolongs the Therapeutic Effect of the Combination
      of BEZ235 and Radiotherapy for Colorectal Cancer.
LID - 1204
AB  - Our previous study demonstrated that administration of NVP-BEZ235 (BEZ235), a
      dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor, before radiotherapy (RT) enhanced the radiotherapeutic 
      effect in colorectal cancer (CRC) cells both in vitro and in vivo. Here, we
      evaluated whether maintenance BEZ235 treatment, after combinatorial BEZ235 + RT
      therapy, prolonged the antitumor effect in CRC. K-RAS mutant CRC cells (HCT116
      and SW480), wild-type CRC cells (HT29), and HCT116 xenograft tumors were
      separated into the following six study groups: (1) untreated (control); (2) RT
      alone; (3) BEZ235 alone; (4) RT + BEZ235; (5) maintenance BEZ235 following RT +
      BEZ235 (RT + BEZ235 + mBEZ235); and (6) maintenance BEZ235 following BEZ235
      (BEZ235 + mBEZ235). RT + BEZ235 + mBEZ235 treatment significantly inhibited cell 
      viability and increased apoptosis in three CRC cell lines compared to the other
      five treatments in vitro. In the HCT116 xenograft tumor model, RT + BEZ235 +
      mBEZ235 treatment significantly reduced the tumor size when compared to the other
      five treatments. Furthermore, the expression of mTOR signaling molecules (p-rpS6 
      and p-eIF4E), DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair-related molecules (p-ATM and
      p-DNA-PKcs), and angiogenesis-related molecules (VEGF-A and HIF-1α) was
      significantly downregulated after RT + BEZ235 + mBEZ235 treatment both in vitro
      and in vivo when compared to the RT + BEZ235, RT, BEZ235, BEZ235 + mBEZ235, and
      control treatments. Cleaved caspase-3, cleaved poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase
      (PARP), 53BP1, and γ-H2AX expression in the HCT116 xenograft tissue and three CRC
      cell lines were significantly upregulated after RT + BEZ235 + mBEZ235 treatment. 
      Maintenance BEZ235 treatment in CRC cells prolonged the inhibition of cell
      viability, enhancement of apoptosis, attenuation of mTOR signaling, impairment of
      the DNA-DSB repair mechanism, and downregulation of angiogenesis that occurred
      due to concurrent BEZ235 and RT treatment.

TI  - A novel member of Prame family, Gm12794c, counteracts retinoic acid
      differentiation through the methyltransferase activity of PRC2.
PG  - 345-62
AB  - Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) fluctuate among different levels of pluripotency
      defined as metastates. Sporadically, metastable cellular populations convert to a
      highly pluripotent metastate that resembles the preimplantation two-cell embryos 
      stage (defined as 2C stage) in terms of transcriptome, DNA methylation, and
      chromatin structure. Recently, we found that the retinoic acid (RA) signaling
      leads to a robust increase of cells specifically expressing 2C genes, such as
      members of the Prame family. Here, we show that Gm12794c, one of the most highly 
      upregulated Prame members, and previously identified as a key player for the
      maintenance of pluripotency, has a functional role in conferring ESCs resistance 
      to RA signaling. In particular, RA-dependent expression of Gm12794c induces a
      ground state-like metastate, as evaluated by activation of 2C-specific genes,
      global DNA hypomethylation and rearrangement of chromatin similar to that
      observed in naive totipotent preimplantation epiblast cells and 2C-like cells.
      Mechanistically, we demonstrated that Gm12794c inhibits Cdkn1A gene expression
      through the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) histone methyltransferase
      activity. Collectively, our data highlight a molecular mechanism employed by ESCs
      to counteract retinoic acid differentiation stimuli and contribute to shed light 
      on the molecular mechanisms at grounds of ESCs naive pluripotency-state
      maintenance.

      sections are reviewed, while another forty-two sections are proposed as new or as
      new combinations. Twenty additional clades are recovered but not formally
      described. Furthermore, six new or combined species names are introduced, and one
      species is neotypified. The structure is supported by morphological characters
      and molecular evidence, based on two (nrITS and nrLSU) and four (nrITS, nrLSU,
      rpb1 and rpb2) loci datasets and analysed by Maximum Likelihood methods (PhyML,
      RAxML). Altogether 789 Cortinarius samples were included in the study.

TI  - Is There A Role for Abscisic Acid, A Proven Anti-Inflammatory Agent, in the
      Treatment of Ischemic Retinopathies?
LID - 104
AB  - Ischemic retinopathies (IRs) are the main cause of severe visual impairment and
      sight loss, and are characterized by loss of blood vessels, accompanied by
      hypoxia, and neovascularization. Actual therapies, based on anti-vascular
      endothelial growth factor (VEGF) strategies, antioxidants or anti-inflammatory
      therapies are only partially effective or show some adverse side effects.
      Abscisic acid (ABA) is a phytohormone present in vegetables and fruits that can
      be naturally supplied by the dietary intake and has been previously studied for
      its benefits to human health. It has been demonstrated that ABA plays a key role 
      in glucose metabolism, inflammation, memory and tumor growth. This review focuses
      on a novel and promising role of ABA as a potential modulator of angiogenesis,
      oxidative status and inflammatory processes in the retina, which are the most
      predominant characteristics of the IRs. Thus, this nutraceutical compound might
      shed some light in new therapeutic strategies focused in the prevention or
      amelioration of IRs-derived pathologies.

TI  - LARP4A recognizes polyA RNA via a novel binding mechanism mediated by disordered 
      regions and involving the PAM2w motif, revealing interplay between PABP, LARP4A
      and mRNA.
PG  - 4272-91
AB  - LARP4A belongs to the ancient RNA-binding protein superfamily of La-related
      proteins (LARPs). In humans, it acts mainly by stabilizing mRNAs, enhancing
      translation and controlling polyA lengths of heterologous mRNAs. These activities
      are known to implicate its association with mRNA, protein partners and
      translating ribosomes, albeit molecular details are missing. Here, we
      characterize the direct interaction between LARP4A, oligoA RNA and the MLLE
      domain of the PolyA-binding protein (PABP). Our study shows that LARP4A–oligoA
      association entails novel RNA recognition features involving the N-terminal
      region of the protein that exists in a semi-disordered state and lacks any
      recognizable RNA-binding motif. Against expectations, we show that the La module,
      the conserved RNA-binding unit across LARPs, is not the principal determinant for
      oligoA interaction, only contributing to binding to a limited degree.
      Furthermore, the variant PABP-interacting motif 2 (PAM2w) featured in the
      N-terminal region of LARP4A was found to be important for both RNA and PABP
      recognition, revealing a new role for this protein–protein binding motif. Our
      analysis demonstrates the mutual exclusive nature of the PAM2w-mediated
      interactions, thereby unveiling a tantalizing interplay between LARP4A, polyA and
      PABP.

TI  - Hyperinsulinemia drives hepatic insulin resistance in male mice with
      liver-specific Ceacam1 deletion independently of lipolysis.
PG  - 33-43
AB  - Background:: CEACAM1 regulates insulin sensitivity by promoting insulin
      clearance. Accordingly, global C57BL/6J.Cc1−/− null mice display hyperinsulinemia
      due to impaired insulin clearance at 2 months of age, followed by insulin
      resistance, steatohepatitis, visceral obesity and leptin resistance at 6 months. 
      The study aimed at investigating the primary role of hepatic CEACAM1 in insulin
      and lipid homeostasis independently of its metabolic effect in extra-hepatic
      tissues. Methods:: Liver-specific C57BL/6J.AlbCre+Cc1fl/fl mice were generated
      and their metabolic phenotype was characterized by comparison to that of their
      littermate controls at 2-9 months of age, using hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp
      analysis and indirect calorimetry. The effect of hyperphagia on insulin
      resistance was assessed by pair-feeding experiments. Results:: Liver-specific
      AlbCre+Cc1fl/fl mutants exhibited impaired insulin clearance and hyperinsulinemia
      at 2 months, followed by hepatic insulin resistance (assessed by
      hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp analysis) and steatohepatitis at ~ 7 months of 
      age, at which point visceral obesity and hyperphagia developed, in parallel to
      hyperleptinemia and blunted hypothalamic STAT3 phosphorylation in response to an 
      intraperitoneal injection of leptin. Hyperinsulinemia caused hypothalamic insulin
      resistance, followed by increased fatty acid synthase activity, which together
      with defective hypothalamic leptin signaling contributed to hyperphagia and
      reduced physical activity. Pair-feeding experiment showed that hyperphagia caused
      systemic insulin resistance, as manifested by blunted insulin signaling in white 
      adipose tissue and lipolysis at 8-9 months of age. Conclusion:: AlbCre+Cc1fl/fl
      mutants provide an in vivo demonstration of the key role of impaired hepatic
      insulin clearance and hyperinsulinemia in the pathogenesis of secondary hepatic
      insulin resistance independently of lipolysis. They also reveal an important role
      for the liver-hypothalamic axis in the regulation of energy balance and
      subsequently, systemic insulin sensitivity.

TI  - Genetics, diagnosis and treatment of Lynch syndrome: Old lessons and current
      challenges.
PG  - 3048-54
AB  - Lynch syndrome (LS) is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder associated with
      germline mutations in DNA mismatch repair (MMR) genes. The carriers of pathogenic
      mutations in these genes have an increased risk of developing a colorectal cancer
      and/or LS-associated cancer. The LS-associated cancer types include carcinomas of
      the endometrium, small intestine, stomach, pancreas and biliary tract, ovary,
      brain, upper urinary tract and skin. The criteria for the clinical diagnosis of
      LS and the procedures of the genetic testing for identification of pathogenetic
      mutations carriers in MMR genes have long been known. A crucial point in the
      mutation detection analysis is the correct definition of the pathogenecity
      associated with MMR genetic variants, especially in order to include the mutation
      carriers in the endoscopy surveillance programs more suited to them. Therefore,
      this may help to improve the LS-associated cancer prevention programs. In the
      present review, we also report the recent discoveries in molecular genetics of
      LS, such as the new roles of MMR protein and immune response of MMR repair
      deficiency in colorectal cancer. Finally, we discuss the main therapeutic
      approaches, including immunotherapy, which represent a valid alternative to
      traditional therapeutic methods and extend the life expectancy of patients that
      have already developed LS-associated colorectal cancer.

TI  - Assessing response to neo-adjuvant therapy in locally advanced rectal cancer
      using Intra-voxel Incoherent Motion modelling by DWI data and Standardized Index 
      of Shape from DCE-MRI.
LID - 1758835918809875
AB  - Background:: Our aim was to investigate preoperative chemoradiation therapy
      (pCRT) response in locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC) comparing standardized
      index of shape (SIS) obtained from dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance
      imaging (DCE-MRI) with intravoxel-incoherent-motion-modelling-derived parameters 
      by diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI). Materials and methods:: Eighty-eight
      patients with LARC were subjected to MRI before and after pCRT. Apparent
      diffusion coefficient (ADC), tissue diffusion (Dt), pseudodiffusion (Dp) and
      perfusion fraction (f) were calculated and percentage changes ∆ADC, ∆Dt, ∆Dp, ∆f 
      were computed. SIS was derived comparing DCE-MRI pre- and post-pCRT.
      Nonparametric tests and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were
      performed. Results:: A total of 52 patients were classified as responders (tumour
      regression grade; TRG ⩽ 2) and 36 as not-responders (TRG > 3). Mann–Whitney U
      test showed statistically significant differences in SIS, ∆ADC and ∆Dt between
      responders and not-responders and between complete responders (19 patients with
      TRG = 1) versus incomplete responders. The best parameters to discriminate
      responders by nonresponders were SIS and ∆ADC, with an accuracy of 91% and 82%
      (cutoffs of −5.2% and 18.7%, respectively); the best parameters to detect
      pathological complete responders were SIS, ∆f and ∆Dp with an accuracy of 78%
      (cutoffs of 38.5%, 60.0% and 83.0%, respectively). No increase of performance was
      observed by combining linearly each possible couple of parameters or combining
      all parameters. Conclusion:: SIS allows assessment of preoperative treatment
      response with high accuracy guiding the surgeon versus more or less conservative 
      treatment. DWI-derived parameters reached less accuracy compared with SIS and
      combining linearly DCE- and DWI-derived parameters; no increase of accuracy was
      obtained.

TI  - Disarrangements and instabilities in augmented one-dimensional hyperelasticity.
LID - 20180312
AB  - In the present work, the overall nonlinear elastic behaviour of a one-dimensional
      multi-modular structure incorporating possible imperfections at the discrete
      (microscale) level is derived with respect to both tensile and compressive
      applied loads. The model is built up through the repetition of n units, each one 
      comprising two rigid rods having equal lengths, linked by means of pointwise
      constraints capable of elastically limiting motions in terms of relative
      translations (sliders) and rotations (hinges). The mechanical response of the
      structure is analysed by varying the number n of the elemental moduli, as well as
      in the limit case of an infinite number of infinitesimal constituents, in light
      of the theory of (first-order) structured deformations (SDs), which interprets
      the deformation of any continuum body as the projection, at the macroscopic
      scale, of geometrical changes occurring at the level of its sub-macroscopic
      elements. In this way, a wide family of nonlinear elastic behaviours is generated
      by tuning internal microstructural parameters, the tensile buckling and the
      classical Euler's elastica under compressive loads resulting as special cases in 
      the so-called continuum limit—say when n→∞. Finally, by plotting the results in
      terms of the first Piola–Kirchhoff stress versus macroscopic stretch, it is for
      the first time demonstrated that such SD-based one-dimensional models can be used
      to generalize some standard hyperelastic behaviours by additionally taking into
      account instability phenomena and concealed defects.

TI  - Coarse-Grained Molecular Dynamics Modelling of a Magnetic Polymersome.
LID - 763
AB  - A coarse-grained molecular dynamics framework is proposed to investigate the
      equilibrium structure and quasi-static deformational response of a magnetic
      polymersome, a hollow object whose magnetoactive part is its shell (membrane). In
      the developed scheme, the shell is modelled as a pair of two concentric
      interfaces, between which a layer of a linearly viscous fluid filled with
      magnetic nanoparticles is confined; the thickness of this layer slightly exceeds 
      the nanoparticle diameter. The shell boundaries possess weak bending elasticity, 
      very high surface tension and are impermeable for the nanoparticles. The
      nanoparticles bear permanent magnetic moments and are translationally and
      rotationally free inside the layer. The factors favoring the particle aggregation
      are the magneto-dipole coupling and Zeeman interaction with the external field;
      the impeding factors are thermal motion and steric restrictions imposed by the
      boundaries. The volume content of magnetic phase in the shell is sufficiently
      small (below 11 vol.%) to enable one to clearly observe structure patterns
      occurring in the basic state and under an applied magnetic field. As shown, both 
      the particle concentration and the level of interparticle interaction strongly
      affect the extent and type of the aggregation that, in turn, causes overall
      deformation of the polymersome: stretching along the applied field and shrinking 
      in the transverse plane.

TI  - Identification of the novel hcbB operon catalyzing the dechlorination of
      pentachlorophenol in the Gram-positive bacterium Nocardioides sp. strain PD653.
PG  - 124-31
AB  - While pcp genes are well known in Gram-negative bacteria to code for the enzymes 
      responsible for pentachlorophenol (C6HCl5O; PCP) degradation, little is known
      about PCP-degrading genes in Gram-positive bacteria. Here we describe a novel
      gene operon possibly responsible for catalyzing the degradation of PCP in the
      Gram-positive bacterium Nocardioides sp. strain PD653, which is capable of
      mineralizing hexachlorobenzene (C6Cl6; HCB) via PCP. Transcriptome analysis based
      on RNA-Seq revealed overexpressed genes in strain PD653 following exposure to
      HCB. Based on in silico annotation, three open reading frames (ORFs) were
      selected as biodegrading enzyme candidates. Recombinant E. coli cells expressing 
      candidate genes degraded approximately 9.4 µmol L−1 PCP in 2 hr. Therefore, we
      designated these genes as hcbB1, hcbB2, and hcbB3. Interestingly, PCP-degrading
      activity was recorded when hcbB3 was coexpressed with hcbB1 or hcbB2, and the
      function of HcbB3 was expected to be similar to chlorophenol 4-monooxygenase
      (TftD).

TI  - Arginine Catabolic Mobile Elements in Livestock-Associated Methicillin-Resistant 
      Staphylococcal Isolates From Bovine Mastitic Milk in China.
LID - 1031
AB  - The arginine catabolic mobile element (ACME) facilitates colonization of
      staphylococci on skin and mucous membranes by improving their tolerances to
      polyamines and acidic conditions. ACME is inserted in tandem with the SCCmec
      element and Staphylococcus epidermidis has been proposed to be a reservoir of
      ACME for other staphylococci. In this study, we investigated the existence of
      ACME in 146 staphylococcal isolates from mastitic milk and found 21 of them
      carried ACME. Almost half of the investigated S. epidermidis isolates contained
      the element. The whole genome of a S. epidermidis strain Y24 with ACME was
      further sequenced and the ACME-SCCmec composite island was assembled. This
      composite island is 81.3 kb long and consisted of 77 ORFs including a methicillin
      resistance gene mecA, a type II’ ACME gene cluster, a virulence gene pls and
      eight heavy metal tolerance genes. Wide existence of ACME in livestock-associated
      staphylococci from this study and a potential risk of spreading ACME among
      different staphylococcal species warrant close monitoring and further studies.

TI  - The Sox2 promoter-driven CD63-GFP transgenic rat model allows tracking of neural 
      stem cell-derived extracellular vesicles.
LID - dmm028779
AB  - Extracellular vesicles (EVs) can modulate microenvironments by transferring
      biomolecules, including RNAs and proteins derived from releasing cells, to target
      cells. To understand the molecular mechanisms maintaining the neural stem cell
      (NSC) niche through EVs, a new transgenic (Tg) rat strain that can release human 
      CD63-GFP-expressing EVs from the NSCs was established. Human CD63-GFP expression 
      was controlled under the rat Sox2 promoter (Sox2/human CD63-GFP), and it was
      expressed in undifferentiated fetal brains. GFP signals were specifically
      observed in in vitro cultured NSCs obtained from embryonic brains of the Tg rats.
      We also demonstrated that embryonic NSC (eNSC)-derived EVs were labelled by human
      CD63-GFP. Furthermore, when we examined the transfer of EVs, eNSC-derived EVs
      were found to be incorporated into astrocytes and eNSCs, thus implying an
      EV-mediated communication between different cell types around NSCs. This new
      Sox2/human CD63-GFP Tg rat strain should provide resources to analyse the
      cell-to-cell communication via EVs in NSC microenvironments.

AB  - The term ‘minimally conscious state’ (MCS) was introduced to describe complex
      non-reflexive behaviours in the absence of functional communication. In a
      critical review, Naccache argues that MCS criteria do not inform us about

TI  - Managing failure: Sir Peter Brian Medawar's transplantation research.
PG  - 75-100
AB  - Sir Peter Medawar experimentally demonstrated immunological tolerance through his
      tissue transplantation experiment in the early and mid-1950s. He made a central
      contribution to modern biomedicine by showing that genetically distinct cells
      introduced into a body during its foetal phase could not only be permanently
      tolerated but also make the host accept any subsequent skin grafts from the
      original cell donors. However, this discovery had only a limited clinical
      applicability. None could practise Medawar's method on human foetuses in
      preparation for their future need for organ or skin transplantation. I analyse
      this problem by focusing on his management of ‘failures’ during the tissue
      transplantation experiments. Through statistical, material, theoretical and
      rhetorical strategies, he managed unsatisfactory findings of his research,
      including unexpected skin infection, sudden animal death and irregularities in
      homograft survival times. I argue that these strategies and their inherent
      ambiguities constituted the course of Medawar's research, enabling him to
      delineate the temporal dimensions of tolerance and a clinical relevance, which
      were mutually contradictory. This paper thus illustrates the multiple roles that 
      failures play in scientific research as well as the conflicting outcomes of
      investigators' efforts to manage them.

TI  - From performance to performativity: The legitimization of US security contracting
      and its consequences.
PG  - 541-59
AB  - Discussions about the legitimacy of private security companies (PSCs) in
      multilateral military interventions abound. This article looks at how the United 
      States has sought to legitimize the outsourcing of security services to PSCs
      through performance-based contracting and performance assessments. Both
      mechanisms aim to demonstrate the effective provision of publicly desirable
      outcomes. However, the immaterial and socially constructed nature of security
      presents major problems for performance assessments in terms of observable and
      measurable outcomes. Performance has therefore given way to performativity – that
      is, the repetitive enactment of particular forms of behaviour and capabilities
      that are simply equated with security as an outcome. The implications of this
      development for the ways in which security has been conceptualized, implemented
      and experienced within US interventions have been profound. Ironically, the
      concern with performance has not encouraged PSCs to pay increased attention to
      their impacts on security environments and civilian populations, but has fostered
      a preoccupation with activities and measurable capabilities that can be easily
      assessed by government auditors.

TI  - Hox genes reveal genomic DNA variation in tetraploid hybrids derived from
      Carassius auratus red var. (female) × Megalobrama amblycephala (male).
LID - 86
AB  - Background: Allotetraploid F1 hybrids (4nF1) (AABB, 4n = 148) were generated from
      the distant hybridization of Carassius auratus red var. (RCC) (AA, 2n = 100) (♀) 
      × Megalobrama amblycephala (BSB) (BB, 2n = 48) (♂). It has been reported that Hox
      gene clusters are highly conserved among plants and vertebrates. In this study,
      we investigated the genomic organization of Hox gene clusters in the
      allotetraploid F1 hybrids and their parents to investigate the polyploidization
      process. Results: There were three copies of Hox genes in the 4nF1 hybrids, two
      copies in RCC and one copy in BSB. In addition, obvious variation and
      pseudogenization were observed in some Hox genes from 4nF1. Conclusion: Our
      results reveal the influence of polyploidization on the organization and
      evolution of Hox gene clusters in fish and also clarify some aspects of
      vertebrate genome evolution. Electronic supplementary material: The online
      version of this article (10.1186/s12863-017-0550-2) contains supplementary
      material, which is available to authorized users.

TI  - Mutational analysis of KRAS and its clinical implications in cervical cancer
      patients.
LID - e4
AB  - Objective: The predictive and prognostic role of KRAS mutations in cervical
      cancer remains inconclusive. The aim of this study was to explore the
      clinicopathological and prognostic relevance of KRAS mutations in invasive
      cervical cancers (ICC). Methods: Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction 
      (PCR) and Sanger sequencing were employed to detect KRAS mutations in 876 ICC
      patients. Quantitative real-time PCR was used to detect human papillomavirus
      (HPV) 16 and HPV 18. Results: Non-synonymous mutations of KRAS were identified in
      30 (3.4%) patients. These mutations were more common in non-squamous cell
      carcinoma than in squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) (8.2% vs. 2.2%, respectively,
      p<0.001) and were associated with HPV 18 infection (p=0.003). The prevalence of
      mutations was highest (18.2%) in the uncommon histological subtypes followed by
      adenocarcinoma (AC, 7.3%) and adenosquamous carcinoma (ASC, 5.8%). During the
      median follow-up of 55 months, compared to patients with wild-type KRAS, a
      greater percentage of patients with mutant KRAS relapsed (20.0% vs. 42.9%,
      respectively, p=0.007). The 3-year relapse-free survival was poorer in patients
      with mutant KRAS than in patients without KRAS mutations (57.1% vs. 81.9%,
      respectively, p=0.001). Furthermore, the multivariate analysis showed that the
      presence of a KRAS mutation was an independent predictor for disease recurrence
      (hazard ratio [HR]=2.064; 95% confidence interval [CI]=1.125–3.787; p=0.019).
      Conclusion: KRAS mutations were predominant in non-SCCs of the cervix and were
      associated with HPV 18 infection. A combination of KRAS mutation detection and
      HPV genotyping would be useful in identifying patient with poor prognosis for
      further interventions.

TI  - ARHGAP29 Mutation Is Associated with Abnormal Oral Epithelial Adhesions.
PG  - 1298-305
AB  - Nonsyndromic cleft lip and/or palate (NSCL/P) is a prevalent birth defect of
      complex etiology. Previous studies identified mutations in ARHGAP29 associated
      with an increased risk for NSCL/P. To investigate the effects of ARHGAP29 in
      vivo, we generated a novel murine allele by inserting a point mutation identified
      in a patient with NSCL/P. This single-nucleotide variation of ARHGAP29 translates
      to an early nonsense mutation (K326X), presumably resulting in loss-of-function
      (LoF). Embryos from Arhgap29K326X/+ intercrosses were harvested at various time
      points. No homozygous Arhgap29K326X animals were found in the 45 analyzed
      litters, assessed as early as embryonic day 8.5 (e8.5). Coronal sectioning of
      e13.5 and e14.5 heads revealed that 59% of Arhgap29K326X/+ mice (n = 37)
      exhibited improper epithelial contact between developing oral structures, while
      none were observed in wild types (n = 10). In addition, Arhgap29K326X/+ embryos
      exhibited a significantly higher percentage of maxillary epithelium in contact
      with mandibular epithelium. Immunofluorescent analyses of the periderm and oral
      adhesions revealed the presence of Arhgap29 in periderm cells. These cells were
      p63 negative, keratin 17 positive, and keratin 6 positive and present at sites of
      adhesion, although occasionally disorganized. Oral adhesions did not appear to
      impair palatogenesis, as all analyzed Arhgap29K326X/+ embryos showed confluent
      palatal mesenchyme and epithelium at e18.5 (n = 16), and no mice were found with 
      a cleft at birth. Collectively, our data demonstrate that ARHGAP29 is required
      for embryonic survival and that heterozygosity for LoF variants of Arhgap29
      increases the incidence and length of oral adhesions at a critical time point
      during orofacial development. In conclusion, we validate the LoF nature of the
      human K326X mutation in vivo and reveal a previously unknown effect of Arhgap29
      in murine craniofacial development.

TI  - Synthetic melanin bound to subunit vaccine antigens significantly enhances CD8+
      T-cell responses.
LID - e0181403
AB  - Cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTLs) play a key role in immunity against cancer;
      however, the induction of CTL responses with currently available vaccines remains
      difficult. Because several reports have suggested that pigmentation and immunity 
      might be functionally linked, we investigated whether melanin can act as an
      adjuvant in vaccines. Short synthetic peptides (8–35 amino acids long) containing
      T-cell epitopes were mixed with a solution of L-Dopa, a precursor of melanin. The
      mixture was then oxidized to generate nanoparticles of melanin-bound peptides.
      Immunization with melanin-bound peptides efficiently triggered CTL responses in
      mice, even against self-antigens and at a very low dose of peptides (microgram
      range). Immunization against a tumor antigen inhibited the growth of established 
      tumors in mice, an effect that was abrogated by the depletion of CD8+
      lymphocytes. These results demonstrate the efficacy of melanin as a vaccine
      adjuvant.

TI  - The (Mis)appropriation of HIV/AIDS advocacy strategies in Global Mental Health:
      towards a more nuanced approach.
LID - 44
AB  - Background: Mental health is increasingly finding a place on global health and
      international development agendas. Advocates for Global Mental Health (GMH), and 
      international organizations such as the World Health Organization (WHO) and the
      World Bank, argue that treatments available in high-income countries should also 
      be made available in low- and middle-income countries. Such arguments are often
      made by comparing mental health to infectious diseases, including the relative
      disease and economic burdens they impose, and pointing to the applicability of
      the right to access treatment for mental health, not only infectious diseases.
      HIV/AIDS advocacy in particular has been held up by GMH advocates as offering an 
      appropriate strategy for generating global commitment. Discussion: There is a
      need to assess how health issues are framed not only in relation to social goods 
      outside of health (such as human rights, security or development), but also in
      relation to other health or disease models, and how health policy and practice is
      shaped as a result. The article debates the merits and consequences of likening
      mental health to HIV/AIDS, and identifies four major problems with the model for 
      GMH advocacy being developed through these analogies: 1. An inappropriately
      universalizing global approach to context-specific problems; 2. A conception of
      human rights that focuses on the right to access treatment at the expense of the 
      right to refuse it; 3. A tendency to treat poverty as a psychiatric issue, rather
      than recognizing that mental distress can be the result of poverty and other
      forms of inequality; 4. The prioritization of destigmatization of disease over
      social justice models. Conclusion: There are significant problems with the
      wholesale adoption of an (often simplified) version of HIV/AIDS advocacy as a
      model for GMH. Yet critical engagement with the important and nuanced differences
      between HIV/AIDS and mental health may nevertheless point to some possibilities
      for productive engagement and cross-fertilisation between advocates, activists
      and scholars in both fields.

TI  - Rationally co-targeting divergent pathways in KRAS wild-type colorectal cancers
      by CANscript technology reveals tumor dependence on Notch and Erbb2.
LID - 1502
AB  - KRAS mutation status can distinguish between metastatic colorectal carcinoma
      (mCRC) patients who may benefit from therapies that target the epidermal growth
      factor receptor (EGFR), such as cetuximab. However, patients whose tumors harbor 
      mutant KRAS (codons 12/13, 61 and 146) are often excluded from EGFR-targeted
      regimens, while other patients with wild type KRAS will sometimes respond
      favorably to these same drugs. These conflicting observations suggest that a more
      robust approach to individualize therapy may enable greater frequency of positive
      clinical outcome for mCRC patients. Here, we utilized alive tumor tissues in
      ex-vivo platform termed CANscript, which preserves the native tumor
      heterogeneity, in order to interrogate the antitumor effects of EGFR-targeted
      drugs in mCRC (n = 40). We demonstrated that, irrespective of KRAS status,
      cetuximab did not induce an antitumor response in a majority of patient tumors.
      In the subset of non-responsive tumors, data showed that expression levels of
      EGFR ligands contributed to a mechanism of resistance. Transcriptomic and
      phosphoproteomic profiling revealed deregulation of multiple pathways,
      significantly the Notch and Erbb2. Targeting these nodes concurrently resulted in
      antitumor efficacy in a majority of cetuximab-resistant tumors. These findings
      highlight the importance of integrating molecular profile and functional testing 
      tools for optimization of alternate strategies in resistant population.

TI  - A case with concurrent duplication, triplication, and uniparental isodisomy at
      1q42.12-qter supporting microhomology-mediated break-induced replication model
      for replicative rearrangements.
LID - 15
AB  - Background: Complex genomic rearrangements (CGRs) consisting of interstitial
      triplications in conjunction with uniparental isodisomy (isoUPD) have rarely been
      reported in patients with multiple congenital anomalies (MCA)/intellectual
      disability (ID). One-ended DNA break repair coupled with microhomology-mediated
      break-induced replication (MMBIR) has been recently proposed as a possible
      mechanism giving rise to interstitial copy number gains and distal isoUPD,
      although only a few cases providing supportive evidence in human congenital
      diseases with MCA have been documented. Case presentation: Here, we report on the
      chromosomal microarray (CMA)-based identification of the first known case with
      concurrent interstitial duplication at 1q42.12-q42.2 and triplication at
      1q42.2-q43 followed by isoUPD for the remainder of chromosome 1q (at 1q43-qter). 
      In distal 1q duplication/triplication overlapping with 1q42.12-q43, variable
      clinical features have been reported, and our 25-year-old patient with MCA/ID
      presented with some of these frequently described features. Further analyses
      including the precise mapping of breakpoint junctions within the CGR in a
      sequence level suggested that the CGR found in association with isoUPD in our
      case is a triplication with flanking duplications, characterized as a
      triplication with a particularly long duplication-inverted
      triplication-duplication (DUP-TRP/INV-DUP) structure. Because microhomology was
      observed in both junctions between the triplicated region and the flanking
      duplicated regions, our case provides supportive evidence for recently proposed
      replication-based mechanisms, such as MMBIR, underlying the formation of
      CGRs + isoUPD implicated in chromosomal disorders. Conclusions: To the best of
      our knowledge, this is the first case of CGRs + isoUPD observed in 1q and having 
      DUP-TRP/INV-DUP structure with a long proximal duplication, which supports
      MMBIR-based model for genomic rearrangements. Molecular cytogenetic analyses
      using CMA containing single-nucleotide polymorphism probes with further analyses 
      of the breakpoint junctions are recommended in cases suspected of having complex 
      chromosomal abnormalities based on discrepancies between clinical and
      conventional cytogenetic findings. Electronic supplementary material: The online

TI  - PET/MR in invasive ductal breast cancer: correlation between imaging markers and 
      histological phenotype.
PG  - 893-902
AB  - Background:: Differences in genetics and receptor expression (phenotypes) of
      invasive ductal breast cancer (IDC) impact on prognosis and treatment response.
      Immunohistochemistry (IHC), the most used technique for IDC phenotyping, has some
      limitations including its invasiveness. We explored the possibility of
      contrast-enhanced positron emission tomography magnetic resonance (CE-FDG PET/MR)
      to discriminate IDC phenotypes. Methods:: 21 IDC patients with IHC assessment of 
      oestrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), human epidermal growth
      factor-2 (HER2), and antigen Ki-67 (Ki67) underwent CE-FDG PET/MR. Magnetic
      resonance-perfusion biomarkers, apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), and
      standard uptake value (SUV) were compared with IHC markers and phenotypes, using 
      a Student's t-test and one-way ANOVA. Results:: ER/PR− tumours demonstrated
      higher Kepmean and SUVmax than ER or PR+ tumours. HER2− tumours displayed higher 
      ADCmean, Kepmean, and SUVmax than HER2+tumours. Only ADCmean discriminated
      Ki67⩽14% tumours (lower ADCmean) from Ki67>14% tumours. PET/MR biomarkers
      correlated with IHC phenotype in 13 out of 21 patients (62% P=0.001).
      Conclusions:: Positron emission tomography magnetic resonance might
      non-invasively help discriminate IDC phenotypes, helping to optimise individual
      therapy options.

TI  - High-Dose Erythropoietin Population Pharmacokinetics in Neonates with
      Hypoxic-Ischemic Encephalopathy Receiving Hypothermia.
PG  - 865-72
AB  - Background: High-dose erythropoietin (Epo) is a promising neuroprotective
      treatment in neonates with hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) receiving
      hypothermia. We evaluated the pharmacokinetics and dose-exposure relationships of
      high-dose Epo in this population to inform future dosing strategies. Methods: We 
      performed a population pharmacokinetic analysis of 47 neonates with HIE treated
      with hypothermia who received up to 6 doses of Epo in two previous clinical
      trials. We compared the ability of different dosing regimens to achieve the
      target neuroprotective Epo exposure levels determined from animal models of
      hypoxic-ischemia (i.e., area under the curve during the first 48 hours of
      treatment [AUC48h] 140,000 mU*h/ml). Results: Birth weight scaled via allometry
      was a significant predictor of Epo clearance and volume of distribution
      (p<0.001). After accounting for birth weight, variation in Epo pharmacokinetics
      between neonates was low (CV% 20%). All 23 neonates who received 1000 U/kg every 
      24 h for the first 2 days of therapy achieved the target AUC48h 140,000 mU*h/ml. 
      No neonate who received a lower dosing regimen achieved this target. Conclusions:
      In neonates with HIE receiving hypothermia, Epo 1000 U/kg every 24 hours for the 
      first 2 days of therapy resulted in consistent achievement of target exposures
      associated with neuroprotection in animal models.

TI  - Tumour biomarkers: homeostasis as a novel prognostic indicator.
LID - 160254
AB  - The term ‘personalized medicine’ refers to a medical procedure that consists in
      the grouping of patients based on their predicted individual response to therapy 
      or risk of disease. In oncologic patients, a ‘tailored’ therapeutic approach may 
      potentially improve their survival and well-being by not only reducing the
      tumour, but also enhancing therapeutic response and minimizing the adverse
      effects. Diagnostic tests are often used to select appropriate and optimal
      therapies that rely both on patient genome and other molecular/cellular analysis.
      Several studies have shown that lifestyle and environmental factors can influence
      the epigenome and that epigenetic events may be involved in carcinogenesis. Thus,
      in addition to traditional biomarkers, epigenetic factors are raising
      considerable interest, because they could potentially be used as an excellent
      tool for cancer diagnosis and prognosis. In this review, we summarize the role of
      conventional cancer genetic biomarkers and their association with epigenomics.
      Furthermore, we will focus on the so-called ‘homeostatic biomarkers’ that result 
      from the physiological response to cancer, emphasizing the concept that an
      altered ‘new’ homeostasis influence not only tumour environment, but also the
      whole organism.

TI  - KRAS exon 2 codon 13 mutation is associated with a better prognosis than codon 12
      mutation following lung metastasectomy in colorectal cancer.
PG  - 2514-24
AB  - Introduction: The utilization of molecular markers as routinely used biomarkers
      is steadily increasing. We aimed to evaluate the potential different prognostic
      values of KRAS exon 2 codons 12 and 13 after lung metastasectomy in colorectal
      cancer (CRC). Results: KRAS codon 12 mutations were observed in 116 patients
      (77%), whereas codon 13 mutations were observed in 34 patients (23%). KRAS codon 
      13 mutations were associated with both longer time to pulmonary recurrence (TTPR)
      (median TTPR: 78 months (95% CI: 50.61–82.56) vs 56 months (95% CI:
      68.71–127.51), P = 0.008) and improved overall survival (OS) (median OS: 82
      months vs 54 months (95% CI: 48.93–59.07), P = 0.009). Multivariate analysis
      confirmed that codon 13 mutations were associated with better outcomes (TTPR: HR:
      0.40 (95% CI: 0.17–0.93), P = 0.033); OS: HR: 0.39 (95% CI: 0.14–1.07), P =
      0.07). Otherwise, no significant difference in OS (P = 0.78) or TTPR (P = 0.72)
      based on the type of amino-acid substitutions was observed among KRAS codon 12
      mutations. Materials and Methods: We retrospectively reviewed data from 525
      patients who underwent a lung metastasectomy for CRC in two departments of
      thoracic surgery from 1998 to 2015 and focused on 150 patients that had KRAS exon
      2 codon 12/13 mutations. Conclusions: KRAS: exon 2 codon 13 mutations, compared
      to codon 12 mutations, seem to be associated with better outcomes following lung 
      metastasectomy in CRC. Prospective multicenter studies are necessary to fully
      understand the prognostic value of KRAS mutations in the lung metastases of CRC.

TI  - Systemic, perioperative management of muscle-invasive bladder cancer and future
      horizons.
PG  - 221-34
AB  - Many patients diagnosed with muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) will develop
      distant metastatic disease. Over the past three decades, perioperative
      cisplatin-based chemotherapy has been investigated for its ability to reduce the 
      number of deaths from bladder cancer. Insufficient evidence is available to fully
      support the use of such chemotherapy in the adjuvant setting; however,
      neoadjuvant cisplatin-based combination chemotherapy has become a standard of
      care for eligible patients based on the improved disease-specific and overall
      survival demonstrated in two randomized phase III trials, compared with surgery
      alone. For patients with disease downstaging to non-MIBC at the time of radical
      cystectomy as a result of neoadjuvant chemotherapy, outcomes are outstanding,
      with 5-year overall survival of 80–90%. Nevertheless, the inability to define
      before treatment the patients who will and those who will not achieve such a
      response has impeded the achievement of better outcomes for patients with MIBC.
      High-throughput DNA and RNA profiling technologies might help to overcome this
      barrier and enable a more-personalized approach to the use of cytotoxic
      neoadjuvant chemotherapy. In the past 2 years, trial results have demonstrated
      the unprecedented ability of immune-checkpoint blockade to induce durable
      remissions in patients with metastatic disease that has progressed after
      chemotherapy; studies are now urgently needed to determine how best to
      incorporate this powerful therapeutic modality into the care of patients with
      MIBC. Herein, we review the evolution of chemotherapy and immunotherapy for
      muscle-invasive bladder cancer.
