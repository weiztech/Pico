# Uploading and Storing Full Text Articles

[CiteMed.io](http://citemed.io) stores the Full Text PDF for **all Retained/Included Articles.**

In many cases, the PDF will need to be purchased and uploaded by the user (or [CiteMed.io](http://citemed.io) Support).

The queue of ‘missing Full Text’ articles can be found in the ‘Upload Full Text’ screen.
