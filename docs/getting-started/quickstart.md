# Quickstart

These sections are all about getting set up to perform your search. They are simply forms to fill out in order to provide the information necessary for final report generations.

Beautiful documentation starts with the content you create — and GitBook makes it easy to get started with any pre-existing content.

### Creating a Device and a Company

If this is your first time running a project (or for a new Manufacturer, or new Device), you will need to create short profiles with the relevant information.

Fill out the following form fields:

**Name:** This is the name that will show up within the [CiteMed.io](http://citemed.io) app. It’s more of an identifier/internal name.

**Short Name:** This is the non-legal name of the manufacturer used in more casual references.

**Long Name**: The full legal entity name of the manufacturer.

**Address:** Manufacturer’s corporate address.

**Logo**: A logo image that will be automatically inserted into final Microsoft Word Document Deliverables

### Select or Create a New Product/Device

The ‘Device’ is the target device for which you are performing the review. It is created with a basic form inside the ‘New Project’ page.
