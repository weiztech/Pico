# Abstract Screening - The First Pass

We perform our reviews in two ‘passes’ the first pass being the review of all abstracts (with the goal of excluding as many as possible from our review).

We have a few tools that help you sort through the pile of abstracts faster.

* Keyword highlighting and ranking of abstracts
* Quick exclusion/inclusion interface
