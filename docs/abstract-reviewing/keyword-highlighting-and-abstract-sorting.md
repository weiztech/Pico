# Keyword Highlighting and Abstract Sorting

[CiteMed.io](http://citemed.io/) provides a simple way to ‘sort’ your abstracts to ensure a faster review. By matching project specific ‘keywords’, articles are sorted by a score from most relevant to your project, to least relevant.

### How Keyword Highlighting Works

[CiteMed.io](http://citemed.io/) is built in with some default Keywords to help sorting. You can view them on the Update Keywords, in the Advanced Menu.

Articles are scored based on how many matches they have of keywords in their title or abstract. See the below example of a scored abstract.

### Keywords Scoring Math

Positive keywords increment the score. All keywords add to the score the of article, except the ‘Exclusion’ keywords which decrement it.

### Changing Keywords

The keyword screen can be changed by adding comma-separated keywords to the existing boxes.
