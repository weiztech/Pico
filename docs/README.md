# Welcome

Welcome and thank you so much for giving [CiteMed.io](http://citemed.io) a try as your systematic literature review platform. Systematic literature review is a crucial process across the Life Sciences, with main use cases in:

* Medical Device (Regulatory, Competitor Analysis, State of the Art, New Development)
* Pharmaceutical (Post Market Surveillance, Regulatory)
* Academia

If you are a medical writer, academic, or QA/RA professional looking to search, review, and manage clinical literature (and adverse events!) for the long haulâ€¦ then you are in the right place!

Sincerely,&#x20;

Ethan Drower & the [CiteMed.io](http://citemed.io) Team
