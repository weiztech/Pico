### Expected Result Count

On some of our databases, we can automatically give you an estimated result count for the search. This is displayed in the ‘Database Expected Result Count’ column.

In this example, Pubmed Central has an estimated 2164 search results, while Pubmed has 33. Cochrane is reporting Not Available which could be 0, or more likely an error on our system fetching the results.



### Edit a Search Term

To re-run a search term and updated the Expected Result Count, click the rounded arrow icon.

To edit a term, either update the text in the box, or click the pencil.

### Search Term Syntax and Errors

Because you are able to run the same term on multiple databases, you run the risk of using bad syntax on one database that is still valid on another one. See our guide below to the different databases.
